And I know I said the same thing after the massage chair but this time I mean it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Really? Of those two explanations which one seems the most likely?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh great. Everything\u2019s good."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You know if I wanted to spend my Saturday nights doing this I could have stayed in India."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh hey Leonard. Ooh are you okay?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"We scored.

We both made mistakes."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What are you gonna do? She wanted to see churches."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well thanks Bernadette.

Are you a Droid?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well she could have said goodbye."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I know right? Watch this. Molecules."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No I was wrong. The looming threat of being crushed under a pile of lumber does add a certain spice. I\u2019ve never felt so alive.  Oh hello Alex.

My sister\u2019s much hotter than your girlfriend and you know it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Did you just quote Star Wars?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Let\u2019s see today\u2019s Thursday.

We have to survive on the supplies we brought."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"No kidding. You didn\u2019t make it easy to find. I spent hours digging around online.

Maybe splicing some genes clone a sheep perhaps grow a human ear on a mouse\u2019s back? Ha-ha I\u2019m a freak!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What hope do I have for establishing new relationships given that my current friends apparently cannot take a few hours out of their lives to help me?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Doesn\u2019t matter. This is no way to make new humans. People coming out of people. It\u2019s some kind of dirty magic show."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh uh we\u2019re making nano vacuum tubes."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":" Penny\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh I\u2019m sorry is that politically incorrect? In India we just call them untouchables."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Don\u2019t be surprised if you find five chocolates missing and three gross coconut ones with a bite taken out. It came that way when I bought it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yup. Be right there. I assume you don\u2019t want wine."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah no I\u2019m fine.

It\u2019s like an earful of melted caramel."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah but exactly who are these people? What are their credentials how are they qualified what makes accidentally noticing a hunk of rock that\u2019s been traipsing around the solar system for billions of years more noteworthy than any other scientific accomplishment made by someone under thirty?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You know I was thinking there are some great research facilities in India."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"See if you can get a table by the window."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What do you guys want to do tonight?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh.

Video games and rock music have desensitized him to violence."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No no no. This is not a fight. I was just excited that someone offered you a part and a little surprised that you\u2019d rather sit at home and do nothing than take it. Now it\u2019s a fight."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I did still a mess."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Also you\u2019re tasked with bringing home all takeout dinners. Tonight is Thai food. You\u2019ll find the standard order in appendix B or downloadable from my FTP server. If you have any questions here\u2019s the FAQ sheet or if you prefer the human touch I do a live web chat called Apartment Talk on Tuesday nights."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Are you saying that I\u2019m forbidden from applying a harmless scientifically valid protocol that will make our lives better?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Leonard?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I had a great time last night."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It never is is it?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I saw what you did there."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Come on someone insulted your girlfriend and you just let him do it.

Thanks."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wow. I don\u2019t know which hurts worse my nose or my heart. Well I\u2019m done speaking to you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That is true. Did you know I figured out in which order I would eat all my friends in the event of an apocalypse?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay listen to me this is just a minor setback."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Maybe we should give them some privacy."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No need to. As soon as she flies into California airspace I\u2019ll feel a disturbance in the Force."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That depends. Does square-dancing with my sister at a Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown count as a date?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hello."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"To paraphrase T.S. Eliot this is the way the world ends not with a bang but with a nephew."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah me too. Um good night.  Leonard?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It certainly is."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh God."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Fine.

It\u2019s wonderful and I swear I\u2019m not saying that because Justin Timberlake is in it."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I was when I came in but it\u2019s amazing what liquor does to guilt. Besides what you might not know is Bernadette is planning on breaking up with Howard."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I think I left my pen in there."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No that can\u2019t be right."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Let\u2019s see what else can I tell you about me that would make you like me? Ooh I love music. Do you love music?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh God."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s worth noting that he died of syphilis."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Not Brian Boitano that\u2019s for sure. How\u2019s your burrito?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What about  Cookies!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Wait a minute. He offered to send you to the North Pole?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I don\u2019t care! And why don\u2019t you think I can find a woman for myself?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"He\u2019s in Texas he\u2019ll never know."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I was humiliated by yet another woman."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Doesn\u2019t matter. Prom is silly anyways."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You have a desk."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I know. You think people are gonna be mad?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Get out!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Go ahead. I have no illusions about my mother. She is a kind loving religiously fanatical right-wing Texan with a slightly out-of-scale head and a mild Dr. Pepper addiction. Anything you\u2019d like to add?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Should I um leave you two alone?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No we\u2019re kind of taking it slow."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well then you might want to avoid East Texas."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Look I\u2019m sorry Raj but the truth is I was with Priya last night."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well that\u2019s Wilshire\u2019s problem. Come on you know there there\u2019s got to be something fun we could do that the guys will hate."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Maybe moving in was a bad idea. I haven\u2019t been here one day I\u2019m already causing problems."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sheldon take a break."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Whether you call it God or the universe or the self we\u2019re all interconnected and that\u2019s just a beautiful\u2026 Son of a bitch that guy just dinged my car. S seriously? You were just gonna drive away? Like my life isn\u2019t hard enough right now. A space probe might be destroyed my parents are going through an awful divorce the guy who cuts my dog\u2019s hair just gave her bangs."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Got it. Take care. I guess I have no choice but to make sweet guilt-free love to you over and over again for the rest of my life."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Their meatballs are pretty good."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well I trusted you and you let me down. The poor thing\u2019s been shaking for hours."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well you\u2019re you\u2019re right. Let\u2019s just go."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I said Good Day! "},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Are you listening to this guy?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay not to be pedantic but the last I checked went out was in fact the past tense of going out which I think we all know is a popular euphemism for saw each other naked."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Toy Story 3?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"It would take the pressure off."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes. I\u2019m attending a party this weekend for a 93-year-old woman. Can you recommend a gift?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well uh how about you keep the store open late and we throw a party for all the people who don\u2019t have dates?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What colour would you like to be?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"All the wealthy and beautiful people in movies ride Jet Skis. That can\u2019t just be a coincidence."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Of course. Please come in."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh I hate when that happens."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Before I forget I\u2019d like your opinion on the menus I\u2019ve prepared for the Halloween party. The theme is food that goes bump in the night."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s okay we\u2019ll figure something out."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Trust me Kripke will fall easy prey to my psychological warfare. Observe. Kripke! I would ask if your robot is prepared to meet its maker but as you are its maker clearly the two of you have met."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It\u2019s all of ours. "},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"How\u2019s this? Pleased to meet you Dr Gablehouser. How fortunate for you that the University has chosen to hire you despite the fact that you\u2019ve done no original research in 25 years and instead have written a series of popular books that reduce the great concepts of science to a series of anecdotes each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration of an average bowel movement. Mahalo."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I suppose we could try to make it a celebration but he died so young."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What is it?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"But you charged me hundreds for this stuff."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"And you moved in anyway?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Where?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh I am. And you realize what the next step is?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You called it."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Howard\u2019s capsule should be re-entering the atmosphere any minute."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I have empathy. Watch. Leonard made me soup and I was mean to him."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"She told you?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hiney?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"The first one\u2019s free? Flash how do you stay in business?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All of them."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Impaired cognitive function."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You\u2019re kidding. Never worked for me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Thank you. That that was wonderful."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"All right standard state fair pie-eating contest rules are no hands first one to clean the pan wins."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Whatever. Can we just get back to this?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m kidding I want you to feel at home here. Decorate it any way that makes you happy."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"As much as I appreciate this I can\u2019t accept it okay? Halley\u2019s my goddaughter I don\u2019t take care of her for money."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well he came out of his room this morning wearing his Darth Vader helmet and tried to choke me to death with the Force so I\u2019d say a little better."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Come on this is silly. Hey um I brought you back a little present from my trip huh? It\u2019s that sailor cap that you wanted. It\u2019s neat huh?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh sorry. Yeah you\u2019re right. Doy. So Howard trolls yay or nay?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"As if one of the plants from Invasion of the Body Snatchers duplicated you in every way only with an absurd amount of hair gel."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It\u2019s bigger than the house my grandfather grew up in."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What a wonderful idea how does this man not have a Nobel?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I didn\u2019t realize I was obligated to share my connection with things you\u2019re a fan of but very well. You enjoy Canadian bacon. I\u2019ve been to Toronto."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Sssshhhh! Penny\u2019s sleeping."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Thanks. Ooh listen I wouldn\u2019t mind a piece of birthday cake provided the old gal\u2019s candle blow is clean and dry."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Sure. Mmm. Bossa nova. You listen to that with your hips as well as your ears."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon gave a lecture at the university tonight. We\u2019re reading the reviews."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"She\u2019s clearly having a working lunch and preferred to eat alone."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Look I didn\u2019t turn a profit last quarter by taking product off the shelves willy-nilly."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh congratulations. You\u2019re the first team to arrive."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Come again?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Actually I don\u2019t need that. I hacked into your e-mail account and read it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Fine go ahead."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Don\u2019t put yourself down. You\u2019re a very attractive man."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"The only threesome I\u2019ve ever had in my life and I\u2019m proud to say it was with this man right here."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay. I don\u2019t know it\u2019s probably a little late to ask you to make me taller. Oh um if you could help out with me and my girlfriend. She\u2019s all the way in India. That would be great."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"All I\u2019m saying is you know Leonard the best."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah th-th-th-that\u2019s what it is so\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So um I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about you and me and the boat."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I don\u2019t get it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It doesn\u2019t?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You take it easy! I need to use your shower."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Waterfalls. Crashing waves. Babbling brooks."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yeah okay just do me a favour and stop talking about how great Claire is."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Open wide here comes the happy train."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right. Well given that missing you is predicated on you leaving logic dictates you must leave."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay fine. Let\u2019s just agree that both creations are special in their own way and it is foolish to try and compare them. Although we didn\u2019t need to have sex with Howard for ours so we win."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I know. I saw the Tweet."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay I don\u2019t need your attitude just hold him there a little longer."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well they weren\u2019t speaking at the time so he had a servant say it to her. Oh maybe I could make a gift for them. I know how much you guys love the coasters I made for you."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I guess it didn\u2019t go well."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"They went to Catalina for the weekend."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay the clue must be in the bag."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You guys just got back together.

Besides aren\u2019t you the one who says there\u2019s nothing more important than the advancement of science?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What happened?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I just got chills."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"If you\u2019re offended let go of the ring and go on home to your mother\u2019s boobies."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Aha."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"In case it comes up again this right here is an imposition."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"She was late.

Jennifer Lopez. Like what is her secret?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No. I dislike the sound of the harp. Its overuse in classic television sitcoms always makes me think I\u2019m going to experience an episode from my past.  I\u2019m sorry Mommy. Don\u2019t be mad at me. Don\u2019t do that!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"It doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m not doing it."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I disagree. Penny is a strong independent woman. The more you try to control her the more she\u2019ll push back."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Where did you hear that?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Why would you do that?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"For which she awarded him the nickname \u201cspeed of light Leonard.\u201d"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"The same thing that happened to Homo Erectus. He was replaced by a superior species."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh come on Leonard it\u2019s you. What\u2019s going to happen? I mean even if there was a stripper all you\u2019d do is avoid eye-contact and maybe offer to help her kid with his homework."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"We seem to be moving on to the annual coitus portion of your birthday festivities."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"No it\u2019s just that everybody\u2019s got someone.

They were having fun wrong."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Relax it wasn\u2019t your fault."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh so you are unencumbered?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"We could. We could also stop using the letter M but I think that idea is isguided and oronic."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah he didn\u2019t tell it right."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Here."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I said I\u2019ll get to it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hi."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":" Penny."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Damn his Vulcan hearing.

She has to or she goes to hell."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"So listen I know we talked about getting a bite to eat in Silver Lake and then seeing the Christmas lights in Griffith Park but Leonard\u2019s talking about a big D and D game at his place."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What are you doing?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah? Did the guy make sure that this has a one terabyte solid-state drive?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sure."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Leave me alone."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You know we\u2019re not that far from Vazquez Rocks."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Excuse me but you are not the only distinguished scientist in this apartment.

Now come on Sheldon finish him off!"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Thank you. I hope she\u2019s half as lovely and amazing as you are."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh don\u2019t worry sweetie.

Sorry Quinto you\u2019re going back."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Please Penny as you know I\u2019m not comfortable with prolonged good-byes and maudlin displays of emotion so I prepared a short video."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yeah before the movie you did 20 minutes on why guacamole turns brown. It turned brown while you were talking."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re good-naturedly ribbing me aren\u2019t you?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey Leonard Sheldon kicked me out of the room gave me your key."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"My enchanted troll bludgeons your screaming harpy with a cursed mace.

I can\u2019t wait to tell them."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What the hell are you talking about?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re just repeating what I said. It\u2019s like living with a lactose-intolerant parrot."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I can\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"When I fail to open this jar and you succeed it will establish you as the alpha male. You see when a female witnesses an exhibition of physical domination she produces the hormone oxytocin. If the two of you then engage in intercourse this will create the biochemical reaction in the brain which lay people naively interpret as falling in love."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So boys how was the pyjama party?

How about we get an electric saw and cut it off?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh no. It\u2019s not just me. No. The railway is four hours from the nearest airport and guess who gets to drive me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"All right. But let me know if you\u2019re going to stuff him with junk food. I don\u2019t want to bring home a nice dinner for him and see it go to waste."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re an  actress correct?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Terrific. Something weird happened and I don\u2019t know what to do about it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Did you see The Lake House?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"At the bottom."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"While I disagree with the premise of tenure if they gave it to me it wouldn\u2019t diminish my output.

How I envy you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Look at it. Non-alcoholic beer."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Look I\u2019m not the kind of guy who drops his friends just because he\u2019s in a relationship."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh yeah it\u2019s Raj\u2019s sister. It\u2019s kind of tough. She\u2019s in India. Also her parents aren\u2019t happy she\u2019s dating someone white."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"As a child I loved Wesley Crusher Wil Wheaton\u2019s character on Star Trek. So I drove for hours by bus to a Star Trek convention at which Wil Wheaton was scheduled to appear so that I could get my Wesley Crusher action figure signed. But he never showed because apparently it was cooler for him to be the lower-left corner on Hollywood Squares. Oh damn! The floppy failed. Well whoever was in charge of quality control at the Verbatim Corporation in 1989 congratulations you just made the list."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Your cell phone was off."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Golly she sounds too good to be true."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And a complete sucker."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Real cocoa?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Guys guys you\u2019re never gonna believe this."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Amy wants me to have it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That\u2019s the spirit."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Thank you Amy.

I only started seeing Zack again so I wouldn\u2019t be alone on New Year\u2019s Eve. How pathetic is that?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Great."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re just saying that to make me feel better."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It went well. Yeah I\u2019ve learned that if you never say you\u2019re sorry the times you do really puts them on their heels.

If we present him as a prize maybe they would."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What? Hey hey! Come back here!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"A party?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Got it. All right I\u2019m thinking one way to counter bias in the peer-review process is for papers to be submitted under gender-neutral names. Like S.

Now when you say look after you mean\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"She won\u2019t notice they\u2019re missing?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Low self-esteem."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"No. You have to read it how Dr. Angus McDougal of the University of Edinburgh would.

Maybe you should look into that."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No problem. Bye. Oh and bye bro! ."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh no no I just I said Whee."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Really because I saw Peter Pan and you\u2019re dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby.

That was clear right? \u2018Cause you\u2019re not getting anything else."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay I gave this a lot of thought and I finally found something to show you how much I love you."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"There are just some things that I feel more comfortable sharing with the girls because they won\u2019t make fun of me or and call me names or ask me if my Koothrapanties are in a bunch."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh so many crazy rules."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You\u2019re kidding me.

Have a seat we\u2019ll get started with the interview."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Do you hear how homophobic you sound?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I did.

Yeah tell me did the guy choose one with a 4K display and a Thunderbolt port?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You would do that for me?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh stop. And I believe this is yours. FYI if you wear that into a bank they will tackle you to the ground."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s the work of noted Hollywood costume designer Deborah Nadoolman.

Leonard standing here with you in front of our family and friends is bringing up a lot of feelings. Like what a good idea it was to elope the first time. But also how incredibly happy you make me. Thank you for marrying me. Hopefully for the last time."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh great. Dr. Gallo is terrific. You know I I\u2019ve always been insecure that no one cares about what I have to say but she made me see\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Interesting. A few people in the comments section have said that my delivery is robotic. Perhaps that isn\u2019t the compliment it sounds like."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Call someone."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No offence but this is pure 100% Nimoy. Because of your mother you\u2019re only 50%.

Sheldon"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh you know I also lied about the girl in the bathroom. Yeah we actually dumped her retainer in the toilet and put it back in her mouth."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay. Oh how about this?

I Tweeted him."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You mean like in bed or in the shower?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Ten nine eight\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"All right let\u2019s just get this stupid game over with."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"We\u2019re going skiing in Switzerland?!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well it\u2019s not forever. It\u2019s just for a while. If you want we can think of him like he\u2019s our dog."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"That\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s okay. Did the right thing. You idiot!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"He\u2019s funny too. He does this hysterical impersonation of Stephen Hawking having phone sex. What are you wearing? That\u2019s not he does it better. Anyway he said he was gonna take me to the gym tomorrow so I\u2019m gonna go practice my situps."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So you think it\u2019s fine if she works for Zack?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Sure."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Surely. Scissors cuts paper paper covers rock rock\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay I found the uh court papers that you and Zack need to fill out. I\u2019ll print them when we get home."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon it\u2019s a date I have a date coming over."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You pushed it are you out of your mind?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Please Sheldon I am so not in the mood."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You mean you and Dr. Slutbunny?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What was your first clue?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Come on think back. It would really help if you had."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes. Maybe she\u2019ll feel so guilty she\u2019ll never make me celebrate the holidays again."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Ask why not again I\u2019ve got an answer."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Why Larry? Did Larry call dibs?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Your mom creeps the hell out of me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"The ring was unguarded it was just sitting on the table anyone could have taken it. Proof? I did."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"If they ever make a movie version of that book you know who should play Leonard\u2019s mother? Sandra Bullock."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey. So where are they?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well it\u2019s very simple. In our ragtag band of scientists with nothing to lose I\u2019m the smart one Wolowitz is the funny one and Koothrappali is the lovable foreigner who struggles to understand our ways and fails. That leaves you by default as the muscle."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah. What if we do get caught who cares? So we get banned from Comic-Con."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No thanks. I\u2019m busy trying to fix this fuel pump."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It has avocado on it. She\u2019s allergic to avocado. Are you so jealous of our relationship you want Amy to die?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Really?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What\u2019s a multiverse?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"How many sips of that beer did he have?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It\u2019s pretty cool they\u2019ve got me in with a guy who\u2019s doing something about hunger in Indonesia and a psychotherapist who\u2019s using dolphins to rehabilitate prisoners and Ellen Page star of the charming independent film Juno."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh um is Penny here?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Anyway I was hoping I could uh pick your brains a little. I\u2019m supposed to take Lucy out Friday and I need a killer first date."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"That\u2019s on the registration?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Can\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I\u2019ve got wine at my place and some bubble wrap we could pop."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And you\u2019re wrong about Hinduism and cows."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh Penny where do I begin? The simple-mindedness of your idea is exceeded only by its crass consumerism and banality."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll find a decent chapel."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I don\u2019t want to celebrate."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"It\u2019s exactly the same\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh they did.

Who needs a thousand sparkly flower barrettes with rhinestones?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"There there\u2019s chapters about potty training and bed-wetting and masturbation. Basically if something came out of me she wrote about it. You know what? Do whatever you want just don\u2019t talk to me about it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard I believe it is. This is trash talk and trash talk is a traditional component in all sporting events. Kripke your robot is inferior and it will be defeated by ours because ours exceeds yours in both design and execution. Also I\u2019m given to understand that your mother is overweight."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh the walls are dripping blood which looks nothing like a phenolphthalein indicator exposed to a sodium carbonate solution.  Ah. Okay all right. That one was clever. Skeleton with phosphorous on a zip line. Come on out merry pranksters. Take a bow."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Of course."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Mm. Your aunt in Modesto?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What do you do you just go out there and gambol about like a bunny?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Mm-hmm."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well in The Sound of Music Julie Andrews says let\u2019s start at the very beginning a very good place to start."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I wonder if it\u2019s from like ancient Rome where they\u2019d actually chop somebody\u2019s ass off and then go here. You know to appease Loseroneous the god of losers."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey guys this is my friend Zack."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Every once in a while before we\u2019d go to bed I\u2019d put on a little show for her."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Is that what he\u2019s drinking? It\u2019s not even real beer."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey what\u2019s your problem?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh right. Good one."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I was afraid of that.

Again thank you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hear hear."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Eleven."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You ever gonna tell him?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I um I don\u2019t follow."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Why don\u2019t you just have Robert E. Lee charge the line with Shiva and Ganesh."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"She got lucky."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh that\u2019s a nice one. Was it yours when you were little?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Ooh strike three."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah okay. The thing is I kind of told my father we got back together again."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well my game is better \u2019cause instead of marrying someone you get to eat them."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I don\u2019t know. Why do I own one?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t think so. I believe that a joke is a brief oral narrative with a climactic humorous twist. For example uh Wolowitz\u2019s mother is so fat that she decided to go on a diet or exercise or both. See? The twist is that people don\u2019t usually change. Well they don\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well perhaps I am a little under the weather. It\u2019s nothing a little cold medicine and tea can\u2019t fix."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh my God I\u2019m going blind."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Lock and load."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Guys if I wanted to hear people be bitchy I\u2019d go to my real salon."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Why do you hate me?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Fusion and Asians? I\u2019m trying not to think about science."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"If there was an asteroid strike wouldn\u2019t you die too?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Are you done?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No visiting professor. Anyway the local cuisine was a little more sausage-based than I\u2019m used to and the result was an internal blitzkrieg with my lower intestine playing the part of Czechoslovakia."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Wait how can how can anyone ruin Raiders? It\u2019s perfect."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Just open it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I mean without lying."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Time machine."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No but now that you\u2019re being weird about it maybe I should."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"How is that my fault?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey make sure you tell him that you weren\u2019t home when he came by and that your Indian friend gave you the message the moment you stepped through the door."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh. Good for you. So all you have to do here is say you\u2019re sorry to Leonard but say it sarcastically."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I suppose that\u2019s true. You\u2019re such a glass half-full kind of guy. I\u2019m going to miss that."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No kidding."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"So I hear you saying you\u2019re angry with your mother."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh I totally am. If it wasn\u2019t for this beer I couldn\u2019t even talk to you right now. I\u2019m a wreck. There are many things seriously wrong with me. And not quirks either. Like diagnosable psychological problems. Maybe brain damage."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So are you gonna see her again?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Mm-hmm."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You do?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I can\u2019t take the bus any more. They don\u2019t have seatbelts. And they won\u2019t let you lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay. But I think it could have ended with the karaoke."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Come on it\u2019s just a video game. And we suck at it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay okay okay. Thumbs down. Next."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I know. Powerful stuff huh?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes. I play the word quiver with a triple letter and a double word score for 72 points. That ought to let the air out of your tyres Hawking."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No I\u2019ll go to your haggis party. But I\u2019m telling you this is adness. This is utter and coplete adness."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m sorry but at what point do you put this see what you can do plan into action?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Just go."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Come on buddy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh no they found the element.  No no stop it. I don\u2019t need to take this admiration from the likes of you people. How do I make them stop loving me?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You still see her?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You\u2019re kidding."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well it\u2019s not just the pants it\u2019s just it\u2019s like since we got married he doesn\u2019t really try any more."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That doesn\u2019t help."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Screw you. That was a beautifully written penis metaphor."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"And what would that be?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Uh well no no not in\u2026 not in those words."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh this is like a nightmare. Get lost!"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Penny how\u2019s it going over there?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey can I start you off with something to drink?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And taking her first step towards a lifetime of laughter love and best of all rules."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Without me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Making pretty good time huh?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Put it on. Let\u2019s share the experience."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey I bought M&Ms at the vending machine and two bags came out."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh now Perlmutter\u2019s shaking the King\u2019s hand. Yeah check for your watch Gustaf. He might have lifted it."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"No he\u2019s doesn\u2019t! He\u2019s lying to you!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Impressive but we must be cautious."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Great. So you just let me know when you know. So\u2026  Oh God I am the bad fish! What did I do wrong?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh okay. Uh brothers and sisters I have none but this man\u2019s father is my father\u2019s son.

No I had my sister slip it in her bag so that I can track her like a sea turtle."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh. Oh my God that is the most beautiful thing anyone\u2019s ever said to me."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019m a little jealous of the people who get to do it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I go outside and I talk to people. Alright here what actor holds the record for being named people magazine\u2019s sexiest man alive?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well I know how you feel. I tried one of those electronic Japanese toilets practically shot myself across the room."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m sorry. I was just trying to help."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well that seems like a snooze. Even for public radio."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hi. Ready to go?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I thought that too. But then I got my first waffle maker and never questioned her again."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I\u2019m sure you were great."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I\u2019m sorry I seem to be taking an annoying amount of time deciding how I feel about this."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"The dealer doesn\u2019t care Kripke has no authority over us and you being related to a metal container would explain a lot. Help me hook this up."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Dear God no!"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"No not at all."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hey Stuart come on in."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Um\u2026 three little kittens?

It\u2019s just a little ultrasonic blast to scare him off. Trust me if I had a death ray I wouldn\u2019t be living here. I\u2019d be in my lair enjoying the money the people of Earth gave me for not using my death ray. All right and in three two one. "},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Getting kind of grim."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well in that case try removing the irritating patch of brown skin standing next to you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay what do you think?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh and don\u2019t cheap out on the tip. We all know you\u2019re loaded now."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well you know the way I took my clothes off."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And every morning."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Howard and Bernadette you tried to comfort me when I was ill and I treated you terribly.

I\u2019m in breach of my security clearance. I\u2019m going to prison. And you know what happens to people like me in prison. I\u2019ll be forced to be some large man\u2019s tutor."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No on the contrary.

What a buzz kill that was."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well which is it?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well given my history on the subject t seems a little reckless to bring it up now."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I promise.

Gentlemen are you ready?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I just think it might look more natural if you talked to me instead of the camera you know like like a real conversation.

It was pure Disney magic."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well of course you don\u2019t get it I haven\u2019t made it yet.

And while you\u2019re at it I\u2019m upset that we have an unannounced houseguest so make me cocoa. Point of inquiry given that Leonard is your secondary friend and Koothrappali is your primary friend why didn\u2019t you seek refuge under his roof?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I really don\u2019t understand your objections Professor Goldfarb why wouldn\u2019t the Senoran Desert make a perfectly good promised land?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What recordings?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What?

The convention is to bring an upset person a hot beverage."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well we did it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey can I ask you a question? You\u2019ve been married for a while is it normal for the husband to kind of completely stop giving a crap?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"This has nothing to do with religion. This has to do with the fact that you\u2019re a tiny tiny man who still lives with his mother."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh good. Hi Mom. How are you? But Mom she keeps sitting in my spot. And and she touched my food. Okay yes I took her clothes but she started it. No that\u2019s not fair. Why should I have to apologize? Yeah I really don\u2019t think this is the kind of thing Jesus concerns himself with. No you\u2019re right I don\u2019t really know what Jesus thinks about. All right good-bye.

My heart goes out to the members of the African-American community who like me have been kept down by The Man. Now Fun with Flags is not just for the flag aficionado it\u2019s also for the flag novice so to help me with that please welcome my friend neighbour and flag virgin yeah not a real virgin. She\u2019s had coitus many times. Sometimes within earshot of this flag enthusiast. Once while he was trying to watch The Incredibles. Penny."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hello."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah I am indeed. I have decided instead of wallowing in sadness about Amy it is time that I find myself a new female companion."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well it\u2019s not silly if you think of that group as being led by a big evil baby."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hey."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yeah thank you! This means a lot to me. My friends are like my family. Unless you don\u2019t like them in which case they\u2019re dead to me."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hey."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No no.

You slept with my sister?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What\u2019s with the fish?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Shut up."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I was valedictorian and expected to give an address. Even now I can remember that moment when I walked up to the podium and looked out at the crowd. There must have been thousands of people. My heart started pounding in my chest. I began to hyperventilate. My vision became blurry and before I knew it\u2026 oh dear. "},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Do you actually pay for that haircut?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No no we\u2019re not playing some dumb made-up game."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You\u2019re just sweaty from exercise."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What was that?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh there you go again just another mistake you\u2019re throwing in my face."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Also instead of just living in your mother\u2019s house you could actually live inside her body."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So let me get this straight. You just assumed my paper would be bad so you wrote one for me?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"That would be amazing. I was literally just looking at my moving boxes trying to pick one to live in."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And so instead of bowing to pressure and going to that pointless soiree I stayed right here and did a load of whites."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Fine. You invited your drug dealer brother to stay with us for God knows how long and didn\u2019t bother to ask me first."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m at a loss. If you like you can review my daily log of social interactions and see if there\u2019s a blunder I overlooked."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well it just slipped out. I feel terrible."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You know like most of the time you\u2019re the easygoing Bruce Banner but then when you get angry you kind of turn into like you know grrrrr!"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I think we should talk."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah that\u2019s very comforting."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Come on we should go."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"So who\u2019s up for a movie?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You all right?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Why?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh well nice to meet you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Why?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You know I am very disappointed that I won\u2019t be able to celebrate Howard\u2019s accomplishment tonight."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"How could he do that."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah Penny might be onto something."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh Sheldon!"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Really?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well no not per se but\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sheldon you are right.

Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning the other plays with bones."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"When we tell this story let\u2019s end it differently."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Kinda sorta had to?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m taking a sabbatical because I won\u2019t kow-tow to mediocre minds."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah me too. We\u2019ve got more important things to do. Who cares what stupid forty-three means?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m not the fish."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well I\u2019m a Hindu. My religion teaches that if we suffer in this life we are rewarded in the next. Three months at the North Pole with Sheldon and I\u2019m reborn as a well-hung billionaire with wings!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay you know what? I give up. I\u2019m going to bed."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Aha."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Soon. See I could\u2019ve said in the near future but I didn\u2019t say in the near future because in the near future is three more words than soon. In one the two near three future four. See in the near future is four soon is just one four is more than one saving time already."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay. You know what? I changed my mind. I\u2019m not going."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m sorry. I just don\u2019t buy it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"So you\u2019re saying you wouldn\u2019t leave me for the chance to be one of the first humans to colonize another planet?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Leonard please. The man is talking.

"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Mmm Greek food on pizza night? This is the most delightfully cruel thing we\u2019ve done to Sheldon since we left that fake message from Stephen Hawking on his voice mail."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"If it makes you uncomfortable I\u2019ll switch partners even though the thing\u2019s due next week and everyone already has a partner and I\u2019ll probably end up failing the class."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah let\u2019s see. Uh four Under the Seas two Enchanted Evenings and one Night to Remember that I cannot remember for the life of me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hugh people need to listen to me. It\u2019s time to get in line for the movie. And that\u2019s how you tell a knock-knock joke."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh. Oh and every other day check the water level on the avocado pit."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right. There\u2019s a female."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019ll do it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"If we drop them off at a fire station they have to take them no questions asked."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wolowitz?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"So I did a little research on what the conditions are like in the mines and the guys might be right sounds pretty rough down there. For starters it\u2019s very humid and about a hundred degrees."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Penny."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You have a will?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh honey did your mom not have the talk with you? You know when your private parts started growing?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Um actually can we do it in private?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And on a different but not unrelated topic based on your current efforts to buoy my spirits do you truly believe that you were ever fit to be a cheer leader?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Wow. An end of an era."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"How so?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"No thank you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You two want to be alone?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Four months."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey Sheldon?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"She said she didn\u2019t want to see me any more and I found that insulting."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"He\u2019s asking if we can come as anyone from science-fiction fantasy\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh Dan. My boss who didn\u2019t want to hire me and now\u2019s a little hug machine."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"And the worst sign of all is you\u2019re here and not there."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Uh good. Is Mom around?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well now I wish I had the ability to make that stuff easier for you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You know how they say when friends have sex it can get weird?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh how\u2019d it go at the mechanic?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh my goodness."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"All right let\u2019s buckle down and work."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So go to the bathroom."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Say again."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay I know what I\u2019m going to do."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":" Here. I had to trade the others for my life."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What are you doing?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s not afternoon. That\u2019s preevning."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Can you tell I\u2019m perspiring a little?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Because you\u2019ve been training for this your whole life. You live in a pile of dirty laundry."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wow. No wonder you didn\u2019t get that toothpaste commercial."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No I think it\u2019s a firmware problem."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Please tell me you\u2019re not having coitus."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"A housewarming gift for Raj."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Really so why did you come?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Here\u2019s some champagne."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well now don\u2019t be surprised if like Star Trek it\u2019s cancelled in three."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What would constitute a perfect day for you?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What did they give you?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"No come on please don\u2019t leave."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Kites ho!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What do you want to talk about?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well it\u2019s been fun."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay. What do you want Sheldon?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah yeah we\u2019ll be right there. Leonard?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And I have flag knowledge that I have to get out of here!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What do you think about giving Sheldon\u2019s ticket to Stuart?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I feel like I should say damn."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah well  Sheldon\u2019s still up."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"We can but for the record all chaps are assless."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh you think you\u2019re so clever. Well let me just tell you while I do not currently have a scathing retort you check your e-mail periodically for a doozy."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh sweetie you are so not the guy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Maybe you should put on your Juicy pants again."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You\u2019re useless."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I miss you too."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s a little hard to explain. He does this thing where he pretends he\u2019s in an alternate dimension that occupies the same physical space we\u2019re in but he can\u2019t perceive us."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"No you weren\u2019t because it was a week ago and nobody came. So if you want to solve the mystery of who stabbed Koothrappali in the back with the weapon of indifference it was all of you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh sure. Well you\u2019re fun to look at."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"We don\u2019t need strength we\u2019re physicists. We are the intellectual descendents of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever and I can move the Earth it\u2019s just a matter\u2026  I don\u2019t have this\u2026 I don\u2019t have this I don\u2019t have this."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Look at that that\u2019s a dent. Thank you Howard Ham-Fisted Wolowitz. Did you just shut the TV off in the middle of the classic Deep Space Nine\/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"When I mixed it with Sheldony goodness and cooked it in the Easy-Bake oven of my mind."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh no. This face wasn\u2019t because I didn\u2019t get it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh wow you\u2019re actually going out like that?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Wow. You\u2019re even prettier than Penny said. I can\u2019t believe a girl like you doesn\u2019t have a boyfriend."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I can\u2019t believe you kissed my sister with moth mouth."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well I don\u2019t want to be a jerk but it was kind of a bummer."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay you run into a room full of weapons hit a trip wire a cannon blows your face off you die you\u2019re out of the game."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah. It\u2019s good to see you too. Here you go."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I help the weak. It\u2019s yet another way I\u2019m exactly like Batman."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Um me okay I\u2019m Sagittarius which probably tells you way more than you need to know."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sir I I I\u2019m sorry but I just don\u2019t get it. You came into our lab in the middle of the night and took our prototype and all of our research and didn\u2019t even tell us?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon\u2019s in jail?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Now see I never would have thought to do that. Clearly I made a good choice farming this out to you. But I am telling you Amy hit the boyfriend jackpot. Anyway my socks are on. Let\u2019s knock them off."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Not really no."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Suppose I could run downtown and pick up something at Shel-Mart."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay here you go Leonard one tequila sunrise."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Listen to you. How can I possibly go?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Every time you drink alcohol."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Not that it\u2019s any of your business but she broke up with me."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay like what? Show me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"How could he do this to me? Get back here you stupid bird so I can love you!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yes but our society has undergone a paradigm shift in the information age Sheldon you and I are the alpha males. We shouldn\u2019t have to back down."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Not at all. He\u2019s forgotten how miserable he was the entire time he was up there. It\u2019s like me in those moments when I miss India."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sheldon don\u2019t you get it? If this takes off I won\u2019t have to be a waitress anymore."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well so much for your advice on complimenting Penny."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh I will. There is no telling what might happen."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Did you tell her about your lucky asthma inhaler?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"But um I did have you. And every day at four o\u2019clock you\u2019d come to my house on Channel 68 and we\u2019d do science together. If it hadn\u2019t been for you well who knows what would\u2019ve become of me? You know? Instead of a world-class physicist I could\u2019ve wound up as a hobo. Or a surgeon."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thank you. Befuddled. The word I was looking for was befuddled."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You\u2019re not gonna leave me alone until I do it are you?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wait you have to drive me home."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oooh he\u2019s got me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh that\u2019s true. It\u2019s not like we can get in there."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Let\u2019s see. Hey I was humming. One point for Hufflepuff. What song is that?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Stupid idea."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Fine I told Sheldon that her apartment\u2019s been finished but then you just said it\u2019s not so now I\u2019m all confused."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon we\u2019ve been together so long it\u2019s hard to remember a time you weren\u2019t in my life. And believe me I try. You make me laugh. You make me a better scientist. You make me crazy. You\u2019re more than just my roommate you\u2019re my brother."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"In principle you have a point but as a practical matter need I remind you that it takes experimental pharmaceuticals to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I don\u2019t know I\u2019m torn. I want to know where he\u2019s going but now I kind of want to play with the bunny."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Wuh what about what you said in the restaurant?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Do you still like cilantro?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Personally I would never use a transporter. Because the original Sheldon would have to be disintegrated in order to create a new Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"The ladies?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh my God that is so creepy!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So you\u2019re going to go work at the patent office?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yes you are."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Ugh. English pudding. You get yourself all excited for pudding and here comes a cake with raisins in it. I\u2019m not going."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh come on it\u2019s fun. Ooh! Another bump. Okay. I\u2019ll say an element and uh you say an element whose name starts with the last letter of the one I said okay? I\u2019ll start. Helium. Now you could say Mercury. That would give me a Y. Ooh.  Very clever that\u2019s a tough one. So I go Ytterbium which gets you back to M. So you go Molybdenum and I say Magnesium you say Manganese and  I say Europium and and you\u2019re left with Mendelevium and  there are no more M\u2019s because I believe that Meitnerium should still be called Ekairidium so congratulations you win. Do you wanna go again?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yes you are you\u2019re meant to learn how to drive. Please learn how to drive!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I got lost."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Here you go."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Leonard hang on. Just come here. Maybe we need to let him go."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Really? So every other place you\u2019ve been you thought this was fine?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t know. Maybe."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No you\u2019re coming with me."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Of course not."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I see no large upcoming expenditures unless they develop an affordable technology to fuse my skeleton with adamantium like Wolverine."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Go sit over there."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay well I guess we\u2019re back to the corduroy suit."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I know."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Excellent. Excellent. And on a related point you\u2019re going down punk."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh yeah. Mouth-to-Mouth Mona. You know she used to date Howard?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"We\u2019re up on the roof bouncing laser beams off the moon."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s just a little scary."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I can\u2019t get Emily\u2019s night-stand to close."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"To the tar pits."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Emily Hey."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"We\u2019re home."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh okay. I\u2019ll just go home and be alone. Which is cool. I eat alone I sleep alone I cry alone so cool."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That\u2019s a lousy conversation starter."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Look why don\u2019t I play with you guys tomorrow?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"On the bright side that Oxford study was right. One friend down. I wonder who you\u2019re going to lose next."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Before you go at least let me pack you some Attack of the Scones for the road."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well yeah we did have a date."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Spaghetti with little pieces of hot dog cut up in it!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"With what?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What did he say?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh yay I have a doctorate in astrophysics and I\u2019m every bit as awesome as the pasty-faced owner of a comic book store."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well but don\u2019t a lot of famous actors get their start doing bad movies?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon do you realize I don\u2019t live with the woman I love because of you? No other reason. Just you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Really? You guess you\u2019re in?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What is your problem? Do you use up all your thinking at work and then have none left over for when you get home?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Buddy I I think you might be overreacting."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey Penny. It\u2019s Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh God never again."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"She built an ice castle made a snow monster and gave herself a complete makeover in one day. You know what I saw you do today? Eat a block of cream cheese straight from the foil and lie about it to your wife."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I swear."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Where did you get all this stuff?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No I mean what you find enjoyable."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What? Just because I\u2019m Indian I can\u2019t be a Norse God? No no no Raj has to be an Indian God. That\u2019s racism. I mean look at Wolowitz he\u2019s not English but he\u2019s dressed like Peter Pan. Sheldon is neither sound nor light but he\u2019s obviously the Doppler Effect."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Morning Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Uh."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh. I hadn\u2019t thought about it like that. I wonder if I\u2019ve been experiencing physiological manifestations of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh please. My sister\u2019s much hotter than your girlfriend and you know it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey can we please get back to work?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So why\u2019d you ask?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It was just this one time Papa I swear."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Keep going."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Tears seem appropriate. Enlargement of the heart muscle or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a serious disease which could lead to congestive heart failure."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What are you talking about?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh hey hi."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Drinks do not work that way."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"We don\u2019t have soup."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"We\u2019re not fighting."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Maybe since you\u2019re so good he\u2019s taking his time to meet the challenge. I want Penny to enjoy school\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wine again? Yeah no thank you. I like my grapes the old-fashioned way in a juice box."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What can we do?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No it\u2019s not."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh dear God.  Leonard! Leonard I\u2019m sick!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh it\u2019s not a date Leonard. It\u2019s just a man and a woman hanging out and not having sex at the end of the night."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Is that why I appear to be in downtown Fallujah behind the wheel of an up-armored Humvee?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey Emily listen I\u2019ve been thinking and I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a good idea that I come over."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I do not have to urinate. I am the master of my own bladder. Drat."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s pretty catchy."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It\u2019s a Christmas miracle."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Uh-oh."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"He will he\u2019s really smart."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay.

This is very sweet. Thanks."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What does it say?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"\u2018Cause that\u2019s what we do."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Sorry. I lost my cool."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"On the other hand some physicists are concerned that if the super collider actually works it will create a black hole and swallow up the Earth ending life as we know it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I was able to get out of there before anything else happened but she wants to see me again tomorrow night."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Ooh. I\u2019m gonna get another.

I call these circles zones of privacy. Don\u2019t Google that unless you want to see pictures of people\u2019s genitals. This circle contains only me and you.

Good job Bernadette."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Good evening. I\u2019m your guest lecturer Dr. Sheldon Cooper. I was expecting applause but I suppose stunned silence is equally appropriate. I agreed to speak to you this evening because I was told that you\u2019re the best and the brightest of this university\u2019s doctoral candidates. Hmm. Of course that\u2019s like saying you are the most important electron in a hydrogen atom. \u2018Cause you see there\u2019s only one electron in a hydrogen atom. Best and brightest my sweet patootie. All right let\u2019s begin. Show of hands who here is familiar with the concept of topological insulators? Don\u2019t kid yourselves."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Wow."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Aw."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Look Sheldon I just don\u2019t think that the guys and Leonard really meant to hurt you. You know? They just told an unfortunate lie to deal with a difficult situation. Okay you know what it\u2019s like? Remember that scene in the new Star Trek movie when Kirk has to take over the ship so he tells Spock all that stuff he knew wasn\u2019t true like saying Spock didn\u2019t care his mom died?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Ah it\u2019s good enough for Facebook."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Next Monday."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"How hot is it?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So I just want you to relax and kind of move around in the space.

Sometimes I would just like to be appreciated for my mind."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"And it was Gandhi who said live as if you were to die tomorrow.

Sarcasm."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s not enough that you made me watch that movie but now you mock me with it?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Now would you say ointment is more equal to or less funny than kumquat?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"We accept your challenge. Name a time and place."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"With certain obvious exceptions. Suicide for example."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You know your friend Stuart?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Have you tried anything to fix it?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I both hate you and want to be you.

Let\u2019s give it a shot."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I know."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hmm atom of hydrogen Adam of Maroon 5 mic drop."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"My singing?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It scared me straight Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"All I know Mummy is that he\u2019s a single wealthy doctor and now for some reason there\u2019s no money for your little boy."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Uh you know I\u2019m not really around that much. Amy knows much more than I do."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Not only is he still not talking to me but there\u2019s this thing he does where he stares at you and tries to get your brain to explode. You know like in the classic sci-fi movie Scanners?  You know bzzz-pchew! Never mind. How about this one. It says \u201cI know my physics but I\u2019m still a fun guy!\u201d"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh not so good. We have to talk."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay. I have a request to make."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well anything can sound silly when you put it in that tone."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sure.

They got me\u2026 a motorised dirt bike."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Not to blow on a miniature time machine."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m sorry if you didn\u2019t cheer at my entrance it\u2019s too late to buy into the premise. Anyway I got some extra money from the head of the department and raj can come work for me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"If that\u2019s what you want to do yes."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Go ahead."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Penny just because people appreciate comic books doesn\u2019t make them weirdos. Stuart\u2019s a terrific artist. He went to the Rhode Island School of Design."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Huh. It can\u2019t be a coincidence. There must be some causal link I\u2019m missing."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Space ice is no joke. I can\u2019t even watch Frozen anymore."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Upon review I\u2019ve changed my mind about the Cooper-Hofstadter hypothesis that space-time is like a superfluid. In fact it\u2019s inspired me to come up with my own theory. Maybe space-time is like two clowns with their heads in a bucket much like Cooper and Hofstadter."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t know what to say."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah! Funny how things work out."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No I think she was just trying to help. Plus I really want to do well at this job. So\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh yes.

Of all the Howard humping hookers stories that one\u2019s my favourite!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"37."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Not as pathetic as dressing up like this and going to a comic book store on New Year\u2019s Eve."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah? That\u2019s because you\u2019re beautiful and your beauty fills my heart with love and song."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon we have to call it off."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"She might disappear but she\u2019s definitely not cleaning anything."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What\u2019s up?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hang on. Wait you actually think it\u2019s 2003?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh. I hate to say it but it sounds like he\u2019s interested in her."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"E-e-e-e-eh! Wrong answer but thank you for playing."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Why would I want her number? I don\u2019t want anything to do with this woman."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Really?

Now we get to go to a university and talk about it? That\u2019s pretty cool."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Are you okay to drive?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It it is. It\u2019s not just comic books. They\u2019ve got action figures toys a Tron-themed dance party."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"They are in 2003."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay here\u2019s the deal six months ago my research testing the predicted composition of trans-Neptunian objects ran into a dead end."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You didn\u2019t let me finish. Dinfast . Are those soy-based candles?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It is great isn\u2019t it? We have a wonderful evening ahead of us."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s the comic book store."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Which is stronger than ever. This is about you trying to change my environment which was perfect the way it was."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well it would be except that I left string theory because I decided it was a dead end. Yeah and then she went behind my back to help someone else prove me wrong. My rival no less. I\u2019m sorry you had to see that."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey how\u2019d it go with human resources?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Because of you I\u2019m not allowed to adjust the temperature in my own home. I\u2019m not allowed to whistle. I don\u2019t wear shoes that might squeak."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Ready?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"That\u2019s not overconfidence that\u2019s observation."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"He\u2019s right. You can\u2019t. "},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That\u2019s right say my name and beg me for more \u2019cause I\u2019m gonna give it to you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I quit."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"My birthday."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s bad enough I\u2019m being taken against my will. I don\u2019t see why it has to be in some hippie\u2019s mobile sex dungeon."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well alright then."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Does the baby have a name yet?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Don\u2019t start with me dude."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Now whether that propagation is in the interest of humanity is of course an entirely different question."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No no no you\u2019ve misstated the atomic weight of the target."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Why not?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh. Yeah. Okay sure. What\u2019s going on with your brother?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Why do I need you now?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It is. You just kind of put a damper on things when you said the next person I see talking with food in their mouth will be put to death."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Why do you even want this here? Its size is completely disproportionate to its purpose."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"But I thought you wanted to cancel?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yeah I calmed her down but she\u2019s not going to Vegas if he\u2019s going."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Now you can come with us."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay Sheldon.

You should hear how she talks about you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh uh Howard was an astronaut.

Yeah I wonder if that\u2019s related to the 12th century Persian philosopher Al-Ghazali and his story of a man caught between two dates."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Whatever it is I\u2019m guessing we\u2019re doing it wrong."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh.

Oh no wonder women don\u2019t like you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"That is the sickest thing I\u2019ve ever heard."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t know it just came out. People say weird things during sex all the time."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"It\u2019s right over there."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh I hope it\u2019s just a sprain. I cannot walk into that E.R. with another video game injury."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Right.

Alright I\u2019ve got to shower you guys um make yourselves comfortable."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m trying but I\u2019m judging."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"In the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. In the summer it\u2019s directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there and there. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct thus discouraging conversation nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion I could go on but I think I\u2019ve made my point."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I believe they engaged in coitus but more importantly if Leonard had not abandoned his story would you have found it plausible?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"As I was saying\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"How did I do that? I got to remember how I did that."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Wait a minute. You hate dogs."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t want to talk about it.

This is a 100% sex-is-off-the-table I\u2019m sorry."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I have money."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh God did he make a move on you?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re welcome. Anyhow on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being always initiated by him and 5 being always initiated by you how do you prefer your sexual encounters to begin?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Whoa!"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Uncle Howard.

An examination of the economic cultural and political roots of slavery in the Old South 1619 to 1865. What the hell is this?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hang on Leonard while I have no respect for Leslie as a scientist or a human being for that matter we have to concede her undeniable expertise in the interrelated fields of promiscuity and general sluttiness."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Ointment?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh. Well that\u2019s like my high school too. But instead of a curse it was crabs."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019m sorry that\u2019s ambiguous.

Guess we\u2019re gonna talk about you now."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Even though the menu description specifies shredded?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh yes it\u2019s quite extensive. But if we complete it we get a free expansion pack 75 additional quests."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No no comfort is the enemy. You know what\u2019s comfortable? Slippers and blankets and panda bears. Imagine a panda bear with Richard Feynman\u2019s face on it.

Lap hands face and personal emergencies. If you like starting tomorrow I\u2019ll add a guest napkin but I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s nothing I can do for you today.  Good luck.

This is where we could have been if Koothrappali hadn\u2019t ordered dessert."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay. How \u2019bout a little Miley Cyrus next?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Good good."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Go away. She wants New Delhi not Kosher deli.

Nothing!"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Does the smart-ass know that Terminator was actually ripped off from an Outer Limits script called Demon With a Glass Hand by Harlan Ellison?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay. But you using Sheldon to do your dirty work is like when Cersei used the King\u2019s Guard to do her bidding."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Be ruthless. You tell him if he doesn\u2019t start talking we\u2019ll register a complaint with his Internet service provider."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Look wait Sheldon this has gotten out of hand okay? I\u2019ve done some stupid things you\u2019ve done some stupid things how about we just call it even and move on with our lives?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yes honestly."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You know what? Don\u2019t talk to me like I\u2019m an idiot."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I do but I feel uncomfortable saying it out loud in front of these police officers."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Thank you Bernadette. That was perfect."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Did you have fun doing it?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That is true. I have a higher than normal body density. If I run too deep a bath I drown."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t know. Why?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah. And I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re taking her side. By being my girlfriend she\u2019s saying you\u2019re a weirdo too."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah so just apologize to him okay?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t know just having a good day. This morning Sheldon fell asleep on the way to work so I got to listen to the radio. That was pretty crazy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Would you be sleeping over again this evening? Because you\u2019re welcome to."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Maybe she\u2019s his lawyer."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"We\u2019re shocked."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Doing what?  All right you\u2019ve made your point."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well based on what you told me I\u2019m not surprised."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"The exercise Sheldon.

I\u2019m sorry if you didn\u2019t think we were taking it seriously. We love animals."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"This is weird right?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Maybe this will overcome your reluctance. I went on the Internet and found a photograph of a 25-year-old Mrs. Latham to get your libido humming. Check out those saddle shoes. Rar!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"We don\u2019t have an appointment. We we\u2019re just fans of Mr. Lucas\u2019s work and we thought we\u2019d take a shot and see if we could get in and look around."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yeah it\u2019s nice to get dressed up once in a while."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"We really shouldn\u2019t be standing here."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah I bet you leave your patients in stitches. That was also humorous."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Unhand me. This is ridiculous."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"First I want to say that it\u2019s not Sheldon\u2019s fault he tried very hard to keep your secret if Howard hadn\u2019t drugged him he would have taken it to his grave."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I don\u2019t want to be in a jar. I want my brain in an android body. Eight feet tall and ripped."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Thank you but if I\u2019m gonna just take advantage of my friends I might as well keep on relying on my father."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"December 25 1642 Julian calendar Sir Isaac Newton is born. Jesus on the other hand was actually born in the summer. His birthday was moved to coincide with a traditional pagan holiday that celebrated the winter solstice with lit fires and slaughtered goats. Which frankly sounds like more fun than 12 hours of church with my mother followed by a fruitcake."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well the Germans have always been a comforting people. Just remember Leonard where your biological family has failed you you always have me your surrogate family."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I suggest no liquids after 11pm."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"So how did you two meet?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Do you like trains?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"So what\u2019s up?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"She\u2019s not hiding.

Only when your brother eats this no one has to call Poison Control."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Got it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Penny\u2019s busy with my mother so I\u2019m in."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh.

What\u2019s funny?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh me too."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"No no it\u2019s a very promising area. In a perfect world I\u2019d spend several more years on it.

Where am I going? I\u2019m on a train. Now what you\u2019ll be looking for is a small wooden box located between a Hoberman\u2019s sphere and a sample of quartz flecked with pyrite.

Usually nobody wants to be alone with me.   "},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Penny I assure you I\u2019m fine. My relationship with Amy was purely intellectual. There were no emotional bonds the severing of which would cause me any discomfort. The relationship simply outlived its utility and I\u2019m continuing on with my life as before."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Choo got a problem with that papi?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I would snort in derision and throw my arms in the air exhausted by your constant tomfoolery."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well find out."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh of course.

Well you know I I\u2019ve got two hands and a bit of a drinking problem."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Does the gazelle with a flair for storytelling know he\u2019s just ripping off Terminator?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hey Claire."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Uh come on good night Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thank you for coming on such short notice."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What\u2019s classified?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No kidding."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That\u2019s it? You\u2019re not gonna make some dumb joke or some inappropriate comment?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"A machine that reads emotions is intriguing.

You should know I do it for you more than anyone."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Like J-Lo\u2019s hair."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh an exotic little treat. I was just talking to Siri about Peking duck and she said she knew about four Chinese grocers two of which were fairly close to me. Her spontaneity is contagious."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well in The Sound of Music Julie Andrews says let\u2019s start at the very beginning a very good place to start."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"The implication being that you somehow tripped and fell into her lady parts?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Are you listening to this guy?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Thank you for driving me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You work tirelessly for someone and this is what you get."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh I\u2019ll make English breakfast tea. They destroyed your culture. That\u2019s close enough. You know I\u2019m curious why are you so upset about seeing Emily with another man?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Barkeep! Alexander me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"14 is not oh  yeah never mind."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And you\u2019ve continued to take the university\u2019s money under false pretences? Highly unethical for an astrophysicist. Although practically mandatory for a pirate."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Stupid?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"So what\u2019s up?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay look when you see someone wearing shoes you like you just snap a picture of them and the app goes on the Internet to find out where you can buy them."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh no."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"And if you\u2019re not in the mood for coffee I can always make you a Chai Tea-3PO."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"September 22nd."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Different how?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well there\u2019s no right way Sheldon. I already found a few pieces that fit."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s how you start a psychotherapy session? How am I doing? I was promised a riverboat journey into the jungles of my subconscious. Instead I get the same question I hear from the lady who slices my bologna at Ralph\u2019s."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hello."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah. You know the last couple of weeks have been pretty rough but uh staying here with you guys has really helped take my mind off of it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Doesn\u2019t matter."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Your doctorate is in neurobiology. I fail to see the distinction."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s hard to say."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well I\u2019m just asking if it\u2019s difficult to be fighting with your best friend."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh good. Is the baby born yet?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Forget it guys if I sell to one of you the other two are going to be really mad at me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"This stupid game is why she\u2019s mad in the first place. I\u2019m telling her I\u2019m quitting."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"and then the next day was 73 degrees and the day after that was 72 and then it was 72 again uh then it was 74 and that brings us to today at I\u2019d wear shorts if I had a pair. 78."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well I\u2019m very happy for you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Come with me to Raj\u2019s and eat there."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I am looking at you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"This turned out pretty well huh?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"How do you take your coffee?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You cannot exist as a virtual presence. Not here and certainly not at work. Oh good God."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"So you\u2019re wandering all around by yourself? That\u2019s not the kind of hero\u2019s welcome an astronaut should come home to."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Certainly."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You have a beautiful voice."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No I thought that would be a nice surprise for her."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Uh look you and I haven\u2019t made any commitments to each other."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh hey. There\u2019s been something I\u2019ve been meaning to tell you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That is the intoxicating aroma of Kadhai Paneer a perfect culinary representation of the freedom this evening holds. Not only is it Indian cuisine which Koothrappali loathes it contains a generous helping of peanuts which would reduce Wolowitz to a wheezing 97 pound blister. And finally it\u2019s main ingredient is Paneer a farmer\u2019s cheese which would cause Leonard to render any room uninhabitable within minutes."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You were so cute huffin\u2019 and puffin\u2019. There\u2019s Amy. I just know you\u2019re gonna hit it off. You both have the same fashion sense. Hello. Come in say hi to my Meemaw."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Fine.

I just saved us forty bucks."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I must say I\u2019m shocked by this betrayal."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t have a vet. I have a podiatrist an optometrist an allergist a dermatologist a urologist. You\u2019d think I\u2019d have a vet."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Did he finally write a sequel to his autobiography?

I mean he\u2019s your first boyfriend and all."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I just felt like drinking alone because I\u2019m deep and dark."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes or good for us if you sign here and reinstate the full roommate agreement."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I suppose I could spare a few minutes. Were you robbed?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Ah sure. That\u2019d be nice."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You say you\u2019re from New Jersey but how can I believe you?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey did you ever think about the military applications for the guidance system?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m sorry go ahead."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Shut your ass!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Who is that with him?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It\u2019s a re-writable CD.

It\u2019s called Uber."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Why are you waving a white flag?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Like what?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay let me put it this way I\u2019m doing it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I was not aware of that."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You mean Project Lenwoloppali?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No. You can leave if you want to. I\u2019m gonna see this through."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I can\u2019t believe they let him into Canada."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah hi listen I know what\u2019s been bothering you about us and I have the answer."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"The theory is that if you really tax your brain the neurofibers will become thicker and the glial cells more lustrous."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"If it makes you feel any better Amy and I are fine. I mean really good."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh yes we\u2019ve got the moon and the trees and Elizabeth McNulty who apparently died when she was the same age I am."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"There\u2019s a speaker box.

Whether we make the switch from Post Raisin Bran to Kellogg\u2019s Raisin Bran should not require parliamentary procedure."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh. Oh! You mean something I could do."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Did you guys see there\u2019s an Avengers screening?

Wasn\u2019t everything in there?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Sheldon for God\u2019s sakes don\u2019t make me beg."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh. By all means. When I was a boy I would polish my Mee-Maw\u2019s silver. And she would entertain me with stories about growing up in Oklahoma. Interesting woman. You know she once killed a prairie dog with a gravy boat."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Bye."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Are you crazy?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Look at us sneaking around in the middle of the night like a couple of cat burglars."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I could do that."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Do you have any alcohol?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Aw. That\u2019s exactly what you said the first time we slept together.  Oh excuse me. Sheldon. Hey."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon there is no algorithm for making friends!"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I got to tell you we\u2019ve got to stop beating ourselves up like this. Excuse me everybody. Can I have your attention please? We\u2019re all here tonight because we have no one to be with. But that doesn\u2019t make us mutants. The only mutants here are in these comic books. We\u2019ve got to stop defining our self-worth by whether or not we\u2019re in a relationship. You know what I see when I look around? I see a room full of great people. So let\u2019s give ourselves a break. We are a community and as long as we have each other we\u2019re never truly alone."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes. Since their relationship became carnal Penny has upgraded his designated term of endearment thus distinguishing him from those she calls sweetie usually in an attempt to soften a thinly-veiled insult."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hi."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"As usual I\u2019m not following."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"But when you\u2019re insecure no amount of external validation can ever make you feel safe."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I don\u2019t know. He got really serious and I wasn\u2019t ready for it."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Thank you for forgiving me."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It\u2019s only a waste of money if we don\u2019t play with them.  He\u2019s right dawg."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"All right well what do you want to do?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Isabella. Isabella wait wait let me explain."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Mm-hmm and someday we don\u2019t know when maybe you\u2019ll love me back. Ooh I\u2019m up."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Be right there. Hi lover."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I can and I did look up dibs on Wikipedia."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hang on hang on do you not realise what we just did."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No I\u2019m having a relationship problem with Amy. And by the way that book gave me nightmares."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Alright it\u2019s shredded what do you want me to do?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right. So the topic at hand is sexual fidelity. Probably won\u2019t be relying on Seuss here. Although One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish might be surprisingly applicable. Go on."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Come on this is huge Raj is going to be in People magazine. And he didn\u2019t even have to knock up one of the Spears sisters."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Don\u2019t yell at me!"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"All right hotshot let\u2019s hear your Indian."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well that\u2019s it then we\u2019re doomed."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019m just gonna say it.

I want my brain in an android body. Eight feet tall and ripped."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m not allowed to wear my Silver Surfer neck tie but you can wear a bathrobe?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah probably."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Really? Because usually we walk side by side and I just went up two flights of stairs staring at your bottom."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I appreciate it but I think staying with Leonard and Penny makes more sense for everyone."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Ooh Mark Harmon he\u2019s a dreamboat."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It doesn\u2019t matter what I want. It\u2019s your birthday you decide."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Shoo shoo!

I thought it was inspired."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Defcon 5 means no danger.

It had seen Jupiter and Saturn and all their moons but it kept going. When I left India for America I was never more scared in my life. I had no idea what lay ahead. Whenever I feel that way I think about how Voyager is still out there somewhere beyond our solar system going further than anyone ever thought it could. Don\u2019t leave. You can do this."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Talk to her? That\u2019s all you\u2019ve got? With a cool name like Sheldon Cooper\u2019s Council of Ladies I really expected more.

Lose one turn and a retina."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Just pick another game."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Thank you.

In chess a stalemate refers to a situation in which there are no remaining moves. Uh you have plenty of moves available. You could beat us up and steal the money. You could kill us you know. Really you\u2019re only limited by your imagination."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And you just got yourself uninvited. See?

Nobody wants to report anybody."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah sure I guess."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019ll be right back."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh no worries I explained my predicament to our letter carrier. He was sympathetic. His exact words were Got your back Jack. Bitches be crazy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Danger danger."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re right Leonard it\u2019s not a big deal.

We\u2019d hang out we\u2019d read comic books we\u2019d see movies. It\u2019d be like the best relationship ever."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m sorry. Are we really doing this or are we tricking Koothrappali again like with the dinner party?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"In short anyone who told you that you would someday be able to make any significant contribution to physics played a cruel trick on you a cruel trick indeed. Any questions? Of course not. I weep for the future of science. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me the latest issue of Batman is out. Come Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"A chicken that was owned by Mrs. Riley."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh my God I am the worst."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Wow thank you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Bleugh!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No I don\u2019t think so.

At least once a day I ask how you are even though I simply don\u2019t care. I no longer stage spontaneous biohazard drills after 10 pm And I abandoned my goal to master Tuvan throat singing."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You know we could still go. A little rain isn\u2019t gonna kill us."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re right. I have Leonard and Howard and Raj Stuart Penny Leonard\u2019s mom Bernadette Wil Wheaton\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":" Leonard and Penny."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Listen we need to talk."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well I might not have asked you to dance then but I will ask you now."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Huh.

I\u2019ll tell you why. Because today I had an audition it took me two hours to get there I waited an hour for my turn and before I could even start they told me I looked too Midwest for the part. Too Midwest? What the hell does that even mean?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Mom."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Is that right?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"an we change the subject? Spiders give me the jeebie-jeebies."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well this box only covers my work through nursery school. There\u2019s a good deal more to come. I didn\u2019t really hit my academic stride until I cut out that time-suck known as playing outdoors."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hold on a second. Kreplach?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well now instead of idolizing fictional characters you can focus on the real people who are already in your life."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I do eat dinner."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Great. Here you go."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You know the government funded the biggest experiment yet to detect dark matter."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I hadn\u2019t considered that. We do share DNA."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What kind of teenager did you think I was?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"How did she know it was us?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"No. It\u2019s too Brobdingnagian."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay all right honey you know what? There was something I was too scared to tell you yesterday and now I\u2019m just balls-out terrified to tell you but the truth is it wasn\u2019t Barbara Chen it was me.

How awesome is that?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Guys it\u2019s stolen. It should go back to Peter Jackson. He made the movies it belongs to him."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I know. I thought we\u2019d take yours."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"It does have a camera in it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Sarcasm?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Good Lord I made you tea just drink it."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"No it\u2019s not.

Wolowitz would never play that card."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay I think a bit of context here might help."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Help me open it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"As long as you don\u2019t feel it running down your pants you\u2019re fine."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I still don\u2019t like this cushion."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I think we should talk now."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Um yeah if you want. I mean there may not be room. He\u2019s got a lot of stuff like guitars and amplifiers."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It\u2019s like we both had these holes in our lives but now we fill each other\u2019s holes."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You lie down he\u2019ll be here in a minute."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m going back to bed."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I want a picture with Nathan Fillion."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Anyway I\u2019ve learned my lesson. She\u2019s out of my league I\u2019m done with her I\u2019ve got my work one day I\u2019ll win the Nobel Prize and then I\u2019ll die alone."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah I calmed her down but she\u2019s not going to Vegas if he\u2019s going."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Great."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"If it wanted to kill you you\u2019d be dead."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No that train has left the station. Now we can play this one of two ways. You can say trains tell me more or you can just look at me like that and I\u2019ll start."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh uh uh yes I did."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You see? People have been pointing and laughing at me all morning."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No no I do. It\u2019s just I knew I was having curry tonight and I only want one part of my body to burn at a time."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Why? You never thought you\u2019d end up in a relationship and then you met Amy. Maybe there\u2019s someone else out there for you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Go go Power Rangers go!"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m sitting here next to little Lalita Gupta."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"She\u2019s gone Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No. But thank you for asking."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Maybe this isn\u2019t a good idea."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I think the time has come to acknowledge that we are paying the price for some of us failing to attend my Physics Department paintball strategy meeting."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"All right well can\u2019t you like slip him some money or something?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I can see how that would be upsetting. Come in. I\u2019ll get the sheets and blankets for the couch."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Won\u2019t my footsteps set it off?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All he had was an idea."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"He asked her out once it was an embarrassing failure."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That\u2019ll do it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey guys can I just say something? How about we take a moment to think about where we are right now? This is literally the top of the world. Only a handful of people in all of human history will ever see what we are going to see."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"It\u2019s ridiculous."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh sure. And while we\u2019re at it why don\u2019t we put our hands behind our backs have an old-fashioned eating contest?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You didn\u2019t think I was gonna be in your kitchen this morning yet here I am."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Is it? Listen."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah.

Morning Mrs. Gunderson."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"If you really want to challenge yourself you could learn to speak Hindi."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Any ideas Raj?

Here\u2019s where we derive the mass of the dark matter particle."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re making an assumption. Perhaps the comic book store is on fire and he needs your assistance."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You know if you think about it tonight was kind of like a real-life Game of Thrones."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Because you chose your mother\u2019s veins over victory. On three. One two three go!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah well I\u2019ve had a lot on my plate. We happen to live in a golden age of television."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"There it is. What if someone asks?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh that hardly seems fair. But I guess any team that I\u2019m not on has a decided disadvantage."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh grow up."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Of course I do. You\u2019re an important part of my life and I pay attention to the things you are interested in."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Good morning."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay you\u2019re cut off. Anybody need a refill?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sweetie can I just be the girl tonight?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well you didn\u2019t read it right. The new Star Wars is coming. Gah."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Maybe it\u2019s a lingering bacterial infection from all those childhood toilet swirlies."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What kinds of things?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"True. Sorry kid you\u2019ve got it worse than a gibbon."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I know. Blue shag what were you thinking?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What were you doing in his closet?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Now if you\u2019ll excuse me I\u2019m off to buy a pussycat."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"But come on that is a great movie and it starts in ten minutes."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Not until now."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah. You\u2019re gonna be on Skype they\u2019re not gonna see your legs."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Because in the frigid temperatures in the Arctic we need to consume at least 5000 calories a day just to maintain our body weight."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well I brought my moneymaker. Let me shake it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thanks. You too. You know go ahead and take it."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You are but you\u2019ve got kind of a big personality with your flashy clothes and your Woody Allen swagger."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Uh actually I\u2019m seeing both of them."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"That\u2019s a great idea."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"This is exciting."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well my beer isn\u2019t flat and my rack\u2019s not saggy.

All right I\u2019m not going to argue with you. Sheldon Cooper is nothing if not a team player. Dr. Hofstadter you have the conn."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey I don\u2019t want you to go any more."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes yes the disappointing sex. That\u2019s an inexact parallel. You and Leonard can always return to being friends whereas I can never return to a state in which Wolowitz has not bested me like Mrs. Riley\u2019s chicken."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh my pleasure and don\u2019t worry about your presentation today.

And I told you my Pop-Pop because that was the year my grandfather died. I missed him and I wanted him back."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Now you know why we\u2019re not outside."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I\u2019ll be right there.

Tell us again how you screwed up and got Penny back together with her old boyfriend."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey Sheldon I was up in the administration office and I happened to overhear the name of the winner of this year\u2019s Chancellor\u2019s Award for Science."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Look you\u2019re gonna be doing this stuff for a while. You\u2019re just gonna have to find a way to get used to it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So what do you think is there a professional downside to doing it?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh yes Priya. Leonard you know I make a point of never interfering in your personal affairs."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You don\u2019t need air bags."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Now it\u2019s a fun fact."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"And the wave is gone."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You know I struggle with Batman."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh good grief."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Again urban slang. In which I believe I\u2019m gaining remarkable fluency. So what is the down and the low? And don\u2019t worry this is all entirely confidential so you feel free to include any and all shortcomings in the bedroom."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m trying to raise the temperature in here before my nipples tear through my shirt."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh very. Assuming she takes my call."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah well it almost killed me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I can see that. Unless you\u2019re planning on running a marathon choosing both stuffing and mashed potatoes is a starch filled redundancy."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"These are pretty god what flavour is this?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So not funny dad."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No no she\u2019s too proud to ask for the money. I on the other hand feel you should honour your debt."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah just going to a restaurant get some steaks and scotch. Nothing to worry about."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Also since the time machine doesn\u2019t move in space you\u2019ll end up in 1876 Pasadena."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That I would do to her."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m sorry Raj I have no desire to salute any article of clothing tonight.

The movie starts in 17 minutes which means we\u2019ll need to make all the lights on Colorado Boulevard plus skip the concession stand and preshow urination."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Really? Then what were you doing at the comic book store that night?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Why?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"One minute is a long time."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"All right.

And she was the mother of Andromeda who\u2019s over there."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Excuse me Penny but we\u2019re\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"This is the part where you talk."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You you stupid Pop-Tart."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Just hiding some stuff in your closet don\u2019t tell Penny."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Dude can you even open your mouth without spewing a cultural stereotype?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I have a conclusion based on an observation."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Let\u2019s think out of the box for a moment.

The god Kamadeva has shot us with his flowery arrows of love."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No you\u2019re wrong."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What choice did I have?

Amy are you worried that us living together will take the mystery out of our relationship?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You have lost so much weight! That must have been difficult for you because you were so so fat!

How was the comic book store?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh please?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Are you are you sure?

How do you sleep in these things? Silk pajamas on satin sheets? I slid out of the bed like three times."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay that I said. But that\u2019s a real problem. You give a girl another woman\u2019s bra and you will not be having sex with her that night. Maybe the other girl but not her."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"How can she not be sure how she feels? You know when I have a feeling I know it. Trains?

I\u2019m the most pathetic guy you\u2019ve ever met. And that boys and girls is how it\u2019s done."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Not really."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"This place is terrific. Why. why have we never been here before?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"The more interesting question you should be asking is what does this flower smell like?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hard as this may be to believe it\u2019s possible that I\u2019m not boyfriend material."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No. I was just tricking you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You first."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Whoo-hoo!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Don\u2019t be proud of that."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hi Leonard.

It was a happy ending. Well for my nine-fingered Nana."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh this is an unmitigated disaster."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019m hammered."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes well it\u2019s better than what Wolowitz did. He drew a raccoon with what appears to be a distended scrotum."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Maybe something less personal."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s a game that I just invented in which the participants answer physics questions in remedial Spanish.

That\u2019s too bad."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Not you him."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Who are you calling?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I suppose that\u2019s acceptable."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So what do you want to do?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well it\u2019s gonna take at least an hour to eat and I don\u2019t see a Sheldon-approved restaurant proximate to a Sheldon-approved theatre."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Uh let\u2019s see. 704? No wait it\u2019s on clock.

In the summer it\u2019s directly in the path of a cross-breeze created by opening windows there and there. It faces the television at an angle that isn\u2019t direct so he can still talk to everybody yet not so wide that the picture looks distorted."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No it\u2019s Steel Magnolias 2 Even Steelier."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard who\u2019s really in charge?

In the past few weeks unburdened by trivial decisions I\u2019ve co-authored two papers in notable peer-reviewed journals and I\u2019m close to figuring out why the Large Hadron Collider has yet to isolate the Higgs boson particle."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Do you have the enchanted sword?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Whatever."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Howard sit down."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Dude why don\u2019t you just invoke your girlfriend pact with Wolowitz?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey.

If we were the Justice League I\u2019d be Aquaman."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I think what really needs to be rescued is your sense of whimsy but one quest at a time. So what\u2019s the plan?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh come on. They\u2019re playing one across the hall we should too. Okay we are gonna take turns bouncing a quarter off the table and if it goes into this cup the other person has to drink.

Once I got through an entire spring break with nothing but a long T-shirt and a belt."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s not a basket.

I was just talking to Siri about Peking duck and she said she knew about four Chinese grocers two of which were fairly close to me. Her spontaneity is contagious."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well ladies we killed the bottle."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh yeah be careful."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay we\u2019ll call that plan B."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Don\u2019t be like that."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Do I? Listen to me. I need to do this on my own. If I fail I fail. If I pass I pass. Do you get it?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Gosh Raj do you think you\u2019ll ever be able to talk in front of me without being drunk?

But what can you do to help?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What should I tell her."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019ll tell you one thing.

And yes that time I meant it to be dirty."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh half and half instead of whole milk?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Why are you here?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What about the roommate agreement? It specifically states that any changes in furnishing have to be approved by the Furnishing Committee. Which only sits on alternate years. Yeah and by the way it sits over there."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh we really need to get you a girl."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What do you want from me?

Which is probably why it took her so many years to tell me she loved me."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Boy I bet Ellen Pages friends aren\u2019t giving her this kind of crap."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"It\u2019s only logical."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay let me check."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah but she also used to sleep with Zack."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It\u2019s different. You\u2019re people don\u2019t worship lox."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"That\u2019s exactly what I thought. Thank you for listening. You\u2019re a doll. "},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah well sometimes your jokes hurt."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I don\u2019t appreciate your sarcasm but we\u2019ve still got two blocks to go so I\u2019ll put up with it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Meh."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Ah gentlemen what is on the conversational menu this morning?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I can make it but I won\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well then what are we going to do tonight?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"This game\u2019s dangerous. I could get you in trouble."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Not to mention Malibu Koothrappali and his totally bitchin\u2019 dream house."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Look sweetie this is a natural thing to feel okay? But just because good things are happening to Leonard doesn\u2019t take anything away from you. You know what? Let me tell you a little story. Once there was a girl who worked at the Cheesecake Factory and she wasn\u2019t very good at her job."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Or if we ended up making money from this Sheldon and I could split our shares with you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"And we live with Sheldon so the word inconvenience has really lost all meaning."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sheldon aren\u2019t you gonna spend a little time with Amy?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Do you mean?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sure"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Good timing. Dinner\u2019s almost ready."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh. Sure. Absolutely."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Excellent yeah. That was a ruse. They\u2019re not the best. Physics is the best. And by the way coffee was also an unacceptable choice. All right so I see here you\u2019re from Des Moines Iowa. Uh you\u2019re summa cum laude in theoretical physics from Stanford University. Oh and two years ago you had a persistent ear infection. I hope that didn\u2019t cause any hearing loss."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"There\u2019s no way."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be bored?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It might\u2019ve been the worst one we\u2019ve ever had."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Do you want to say it?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh. I guess I\u2019m a special boy. You know sometimes when a boy is special he gets a Fudgsicle. Which by the way tastes like the speed of light."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re not listening to my side of it."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Isn\u2019t there a university policy against dating graduate students?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh that certainly would suck."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay I hate to break this to you and whatever your jammy is but I\u2019m pretty sure she is a prostitute."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah sure."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Thank you. Hey maybe the answer to your career question is in one of these."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Top of the afternoon gentlemen."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"That\u2019s the thing I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not unhappy at all. It\u2019s just I don\u2019t know I I\u2019ve been in love before but it felt different. But maybe this is a new better boring kind of love. Do you ever feel that way about Howard?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I\u2019m sorry Stuart. Thanks anyway."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Wow you popular girls are mean."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well no but when I was a senior in high school one of my friends heard I was going to be named head cheerleader.

What should he do?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t know. Hey look a quarter."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m constitutionally incapable. That\u2019s why I was refused clearance for a very prestigious government research fellowship at a secret military supercollider located beneath a fake agricultural station 12.5 miles south east of Travers City Michigan. Which you did not hear about from me."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Of course not. If I became a famous actress and had to move you would just come with me."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh I forgot to tell you we\u2019re gonna meet up with Bernadette to spy on Amy and her date."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Is the sex starting now?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Honey do you want some coffee?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So what\u2019s going on?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay calm down no-one can make you get married.

Social convention dictates that I let my hair down at a local watering hole. Social convention is stupid."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m thinking!"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"That\u2019s a cute age. They can do so many things."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No. Amy?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"They didn\u2019t used to be. You and Leonard and Penny you all poisoned me with emotions. I was like the Tin Man perfectly content until that evil wizard gave him a heart."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Very well. Enjoy yourself. You\u2019re going to be in the presence of something that I\u2019ve dreamed of seeing for decades. I just hope you\u2019ll be able to appreciate the magnitude of where you are and what it represents."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I gargled with tequila and may have swallowed a teeny bit."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"We only had four servants. And two of them were children."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Please Bernadette. Let me leave with my dignity."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh I\u2019m so glad you asked it like that. You."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You know riding with Leonard has gotten a little tedious lately. The only car game he ever wants to play is the Quiet Game. And he\u2019s terrible at it I always win."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m calling it. I won."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh where to begin? Trees indoors. Overuse of the words \u2019tis and \u2019twas. And the absurd custom of one stocking. Everyone knows socks belong in pairs. Who uses one sock?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Are you impressed by that?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No he doesn\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh dude I wish you had said something before I pounded that last Red Bull."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"The big deal is that nobody touches food on my plate."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You can\u2019t quit. That\u2019s a court-martial offence. That\u2019s punishable by\u2026 You can\u2019t quit."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh voodoo\u2019s real. You don\u2019t want to mess with voodoo."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay that is the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever heard."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Do you think I have what it takes to really make it as an actress?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh hey. I just heard back from the liquid helium guy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I sense that\u2019s not sincere although I have no idea why."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Or dinner.

Okay."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Too slow?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No danger look it\u2019s just me Penny look I got to level 25 and reached Purple Lotus Swamp right?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s asymptotically free partons inside a quark-gluon plasma."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wolowitz has informed me of your grand deception. Do you have anything to say for yourself?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Thank you. Not just for being upset but for believing that could happen."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Absolutely not."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I think she\u2019s smoking hot."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I really thought she would say it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Wake up wake up wake up."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"That\u2019s cruel. You know it goes straight to my hips."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Can I control the thermostat?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Come on."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"How come you\u2019re not doing a mission?

I haven\u2019t gotten a single acting job since I moved out here. The closest I came was last month I got a callback for a hemorrhoid commercial."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"All right fine. Well Sheldon I\u2019m no expert but aren\u2019t you completely missing the point of Spock? I mean he liked to act like he had no emotions but he was still half human."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I knew it. Give us the precious!"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I broke up with her."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You saying I don\u2019t have an open mind?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"No. See what I did there?

Why does everything have to be dirty with you?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Dancing?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hot air blowers are incubators and spewers of bacteria and pestilence.

Still not taking you to Switzerland."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"My thank you was not sincere."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I am saying it is not a compliment to call me doable.

Of course I\u2019m joking because the Latin for that is nihil exsorbibo."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"If you ever need a break the owner of the train store will let you leave him there while you get a coffee."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Event A. A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower. Event B. We drive half way across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman\u2019s ex-boyfriend. Query on what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link between these events?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You\u2019re welcome sweetie."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Maybe we should just stop talking about this."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"In the pre-Christian era as the winter solstice approached and the plants died pagans brought evergreen boughs into their homes as an act of sympathetic magic intended to guard the life essences of the plants until spring. This custom was later appropriated by Northern Europeans and eventually it becomes the so-called Christmas tree."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"And then went back to the home they share where they probably fell asleep in the matching pajamas she got them because they both just love penguins."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey Penny. Happy Star Wars Day."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Saturday night at the comic book store they\u2019re having a Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah tournament. First prize is five hundred dollars. If we team up we\u2019d be unstoppable."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Of course you are I\u2019m warm and soothing. I\u2019m like a human bowl of tomato soup."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon I promise. Your uvula does not have an STD."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Magic wand TV remote?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Leonard?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Why are you telling me about my own culture?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That\u2019s not what happened."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You think you\u2019re so cool because your wife is a person?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"No problem. Ooh you made little sandwiches."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh. Something about latin music just makes me feel like I\u2019m on a white sand beach in Rio."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey guys. Congratulations."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I think it\u2019s an old storage room."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay I\u2019m leaving for the conference."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh. Mine was Winnie the Pooh. But anyway why don\u2019t we just take a step back and start with a colour? Right? There are so many amazing ones. Red blue green purple."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"In addition your premise is flawed. In the original film Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimeaux with that very time machine. In Back to the Future Marty McFly got the opportunity to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"He gave me his business card and asked me to please pass it along to Howard."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh shut up!"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh you know. Same old same old. Looked through a telescope saw some stars. Big whoop."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Barkeep! Alexander me."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yeah great."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Why do you have to give your paper to George Smoot?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Fine I\u2019ll leave. But it sounds like somebody needs a fresh diaper."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Wow you just don\u2019t get it do you? Buying me something pretty isn\u2019t going to make our problem just go away."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Here we go."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah but we could get heart-shaped pancakes."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Incredibly so."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"C3PO."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh you\u2019re so arrogant. If you were a superhero your name would be Captain Arrogant. And you know what your superpower would be? Arrogance."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"To pay my cable bill."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No it\u2019s not fine. It is a breach of line etiquette."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"45 seconds is plenty of time for a woman to walk through that door and fall in love with me. You know probably half that if I break out the old cow eyes."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well it\u2019s not the balls-to-the-wall action of badminton or cricket but hey what is?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Leonard\u2019s Day?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon let it go. It\u2019s not a big deal."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No come on you\u2019re not an idiot. Look just help me put it back up."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"But the turn-by-turn voice option isn\u2019t on. I know I\u2019d feel more safe if you turn on the turn-by-turn voice option. I love the turn-by-turn voice option."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh please it\u2019s not a time machine if anything it looks like something Elton John would drive through the Everglades."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well excuse me. That was not a betrayal that was an experiment to determine at what concentration food starts tasting mothy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yay."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hello."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Come on. What do you say? Let me make it up to you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"And for the record bleugh. So what are you drinking?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Or as I know him?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I\u2019m busy."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m still confused."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sure. In my mind that broke the tension with comedy and led to sex."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh I know that now. At first I thought she was cranky because of her horrific menstrual cramps but it turns out no she was genuinely mortified."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Exactly."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Are you trying to manipulate me?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Let\u2019s find out. Leonard ready?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"This is even better than you coming to the showcase because now I get to watch you watch me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Here you go Penny. Shrimp with lobster sauce."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sheldon it\u2019s C just put down C."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t have a problem with Stuart. Besides he gives us a twenty percent discount at his comic book store."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You know all those terrible things bullies used to do to us?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hmm. You\u2019re up late."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No I\u2019m not jealous I\u2019m just a little concerned for her. I didn\u2019t like the look of the guy that she was with."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Here\u2019s what I wonder about zombies.  What happens if they can\u2019t get any human flesh to eat? They can\u2019t starve to death they\u2019re already dead."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Ah. New topic. Women delightfully mysterious or bat-crap crazy?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You know it is going to be difficult but I\u2019m going to cancel my plans so I can do this for my bestie."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh derived from the word angel. Appropriate."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Would you rather go back to the apartment and deal with Sheldon or have a stranger carve out your corneas with a laser beam?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"He takes it everywhere to bed to the bathroom."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You see those too."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah I do. They\u2019re filling up on bread and ruining their meal."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well maybe we are like Haroun and Tanweer."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Did you pick up the low sodium soy sauce from the market?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Like I said complicated game."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah only after I eliminated all the obvious answers. You\u2019re welcome."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Not my problem. I just don\u2019t understand how this happened to me. I\u2019m scrupulous about my hygiene. I regularly disinfect my hands and I avoid contact with other people on general principle."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No you do not."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"We can\u2019t afford to lose any more time."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"So all right there he is. So should we introduce ourselves?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"There\u2019s a wet Band-Aid on the shower floor. ."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"There was."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"The skills are transferrable. I just have no interest in going in the water."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey can I talk to you about something? It\u2019s a little awkward."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"That was a lousy suggestion."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh don\u2019t apologize."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"And how you threw up in zero gravity and it floated back in your mouth. And you threw up again. And so on and so on."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Wow really? Called my bluff. All righty then."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I wanted to tell you in the car but you told me to stop talking"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Aw."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Come on. It\u2019s just a cup of coffee."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You do realize we\u2019re allowed to have fun without you?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t know about you but I\u2019m very uncomfortable with all this."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"That cannot be true."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh come on. Why? How bad could it be?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What was all that about me trading sexual favours for material gain?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"This is not anyone\u2019s home this is a swirling vortex of entropy."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Also the pretty girl left."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Anythingforagreencard.com?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And this is a schematic for a bird-trapping device that will ultimately backfire and cause me physical injury?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon get out here."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Perhaps some of his mojo will rub off on us. Maybe between this and his beach house we will be inspired to greatness."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That helped."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Amy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Try to put yourself in my place. Imagine you\u2019re the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but dogs. And then it turns out there\u2019s another human being."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yes to a poor waitress who loves a boot cut."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"The one that estimates the odds of making contact with extraterrestrials by calculating the product of an increasingly restrictive series of fractional values such as those stars with planets and those planets likely to develop life? N equals R times FP times NE times FL times FI times FC times L?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No I said there\u2019s nothing more important than me advancing science."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What? Wh-Where did my cashew chicken come from?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Homeostasis refers to a system\u2019s ability to regulate its internal environment and maintain a constant condition of properties like temperature or pH."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"How\u2019s she doing?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Interesting. I asked two women out today and they both said no."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Damn okay I\u2019ll just take the roof."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Also uh cherries?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"This is Leonard. He\u2019s your best friend in the world."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Mountain Dew. Ah refreshing. Now we\u2019re going to combine these chemicals with ordinary dish soap creating a little exothermic release of oxygen."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Don\u2019t you want to know for sure?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay Jimmy it\u2019s time for you to go."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay now do you really need the honorary Justice League of America membership card?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Uh yeah. Why do you ask?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m coming."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh thank you for coming."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I live here."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well he\u2019s not wrong. Howard did go to the International Space Station."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I really thought he was gonna say let it go."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"How does that work?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What\u2019s that?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"When did you learn how to change a tyre?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well there\u2019s always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter but Occam\u2019s Razor would suggest that someone threw it out."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Wow you don\u2019t look that much alike."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What\u2019s the matter?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No she doesn\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay Howard\u2019s on board. What do you think Leonard?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh yeah. It\u2019s an extremely competitive cutthroat sport."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"A joke. Okay. How about this um okay uh there\u2019s this farmer and he has these chickens but they won\u2019t lay any eggs. So he calls a physicist to help. The physicist then does some calculations and he says um I have a solution but it only works with spherical chickens in a vacuum.  Right?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well regardless she has a distinct advantage in all tavern-based competitions. Pool beer pong wet T-shirt contests they\u2019re all out."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It\u2019s one of his best moves."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay. You know I\u2019ve always been curious. What was Leonard like when he was little?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Penny you\u2019ll have to excuse Sheldon he\u2019s a bit of a germophobe."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"It\u2019s this Friday at eight you guys want to come?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Just because you\u2019re starving doesn\u2019t make you an artist."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m not jealous. I just think it\u2019s silly for you to compare relationships like they\u2019re something that can be quantified."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh but there\u2019s money for a drawer full of Red Vines a marshmallow shooting rifle and a super executive ant farm with glow-in-the-dark sand?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh I have an idea."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well you saw her the other night. Am I wrong?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Megan Pincus."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Lame characters with silly ac\u2026 what kind of actress are you?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Assuming that\u2019s a valid reason not to go which it isn\u2019t how do you know this? Did she say it?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I know."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Not really. Apparently grief can make one less regular."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"This is how you\u2019re going to entertain your little cousin and his friends? By lying to them?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Zack?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"They have some board games."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"On my twelfth birthday I really wanted a titanium centrifuge so you know I could separate radioactive isotopes."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"But what if he does? I\u2019ll be obliged to dine on liver and lungs stuffed in a sheep\u2019s stomach. And frankly blood pudding is essentially the same thing. I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s serving both."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well as you may know I\u2019ve been experimenting with elevated anxiety levels and I thought what better way to increase my discomfort than to subject myself to an evening of tasteless uncensored crotch talk?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah. Sack up dude."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Pathetic. All of you completely pathetic. "},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"He was gonna throw it in the washing machine with his Spiderman underwear. That\u2019s our Lenny huh?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hi!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well you know how they gave me the company car? Didn\u2019t make sense to have two so I sold the other one."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No no. The comforting part is that the Germans have a term for what you\u2019re feeling. Weltschmerz. It means the depression that arises from comparing the world as it is to a hypothetical idealized world."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Am I okay? Leonard I\u2019m on a lifelong trajectory that includes a Nobel Prize and cities named after me all four wisdom teeth fit comfortably in my mouth without need of extraction and my bowel movements run like a German train schedule. Am I okay?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t know. Maybe."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That narrows it down."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"So my visa\u2019s only good as long as I\u2019m employed at the university and when they find out I\u2019ve got squat they\u2019re going to cut me off. By the way when I say squat I mean diddly-squat. I wish I had squat."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I can\u2019t. I\u2019m naked."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I assume you\u2019re referring to the sea shanty. It\u2019s a rhythmic work song designed to increase productivity."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Amy I don\u2019t understand are we broken up or not? It\u2019s like you can\u2019t make up your mind."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Want me to sing it again?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You\u2019re my surrogate family?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No wait. Perhaps I should sleep here so you don\u2019t miss Leonard as much uh \u2019cause you\u2019re being kind of a baby about it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Isn\u2019t that confusing? AA might mean something else to certain people."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Like what?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"If someone as damaged as you can find his way to crawl out of bed each morning I think I can face a simple award ceremony."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You\u2019re right. But what? Mexican? Italian? German? Indian? Greek? Cuban? Chinese? Pizza? Barbecue? Korean? Korean barbecue?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Excuse me. Do you have any books about making friends?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s a somewhat ambiguous response. Am I going or not?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"All right. I like a good brainteaser. Give it a whirl."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Can you say it again for me?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Bye Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah we have plans this weekend. And if it\u2019s a clear night I\u2019m gonna lay some romantic astronomy on her."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Why are you shaking? Are you cold?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Here you want my peas?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Why wouldn\u2019t you take Penny?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well it\u2019s a fun sweater it\u2019s got a bold geometric print."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t know who you talked to but that wasn\u2019t my mother."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Kidding. Just a couple of friends goofin\u2019 around."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"If we poison the critical thinking faculties of children by telling them that rabbits come out of hats then we create adults who believe in astrology and homeopathy and that Ryan Reynolds was a better choice for Green Lantern than lovable rogue Nathan Fillion."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah wait Raj where do you stand on the anthropic principle?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh there it is now that you don\u2019t have a girlfriend you want to hang out with me again."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"And his girlfriend Amy."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"E equals MC squared. Yeah. E is for energy M for mass and C for the speed of light."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hi Penny how\u2019s it going. Listen that guy Mike that you were dating is that still going on?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s David Underhill. So what?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I told you she made spaghetti with little hot dogs. I like spaghetti with little hot dogs."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"The best way to achieve a goal is to devote 100% of your time and energy to it. When I decided I was going to be a physicist I didn\u2019t take some other job in case it didn\u2019t work out. Which wasn\u2019t easy because there was a lot of pressure from Ms. Pearson for me to be chalk monitor that year."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh. Uh uh she liked it fine. But she doesn\u2019t have the history with the franchise I do."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Of course not. And technically magic beans would be food although eating them would be quite a waste since you could plant them and overnight have a giant beanstalk which would provide enough roughage for a small city."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So you know isn\u2019t there maybe some way you and Sheldon could compromise on this whole presentation thing."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I was quoting a man who knows a thing or two about women Sir Elton John."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah good for you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t feel different this alcohol\u2019s defective."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You know you and I have so much fun hanging out. If you were a girl all our problems would be solved."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You know for a Thanksgiving buffet in an aquarium cafeteria that was really bad."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh good. You picked me you picked me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thanks. It\u2019s good."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Don\u2019t take advice from a man who threw his shoe at a crow."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Don\u2019t sign anything? That\u2019s your advice? Okay so uh if during this meeting one of us were to say complete an oil painting you\u2019d recommend that we leave that unsigned?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No he didn\u2019t do anything. So I said you just saw me jaywalk why aren\u2019t you doing your job? You know? May maybe I should arrest you for for impersonating a police officer."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What if we brought them down with us?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Is this the fellow who peed in your Hawaiian Punch?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Once I found a stash of contracts under his bed. It was weird."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I know it only takes one doctor\u2019s finger."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"So first there was PlayStation aka PS1 then PS2 PS3 and now PS4. And that makes sense. You\u2019d think after Xbox there\u2019d be Xbox 2. But no next came Xbox 360. Hmm? And now after 360 comes Xbox One. Why one? Maybe that\u2019s how many seconds of thought they put into naming it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Just look at the board."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"But you\u2019re a dentist he\u2019s nuts."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You mean one of the hopeless geeks? No. Those are crazy people. Howard be a dear and get me another one of these. Now him he\u2019s one of those geeks."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Homesick is a type of being sick."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wow Amy\u2019s mad and Leonard was right. What a weird day."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Jibber-jabber? I don\u2019t jibber-jabber."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m not sure how listening to other nine-fingered banjo players makes me dog but all right."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Are there any chopsticks?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well to be honest Leonard\u2019s on the other line and he offered me their spare bedroom."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh jeez you\u2019ve got to be kidding me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh a little Red Dead Redemption huh?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It\u2019s very nice of you I would like that."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I really like my saber-toothed cat. Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t know what to tell you. Buy her something."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You\u2019re a good friend. I owe you one."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Sounds great!"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay yup. See see that that looks like that looks like they could be bigger. But you know I bet I bet when I do it mine do the same thing."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Wait. What are you talking about?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You know I\u2019m gonna read it either way."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So what do you think we can learn from that behaviour that we can apply to our own lives?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Got a hot girlfriend now. I want the haters to know."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Really? Why?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hi."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay the point is one of the ways we show we care about people is by putting thought and imagination into the gifts we give them."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yes it is. That\u2019s why I broke up with him he always does stuff like that."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So much for our friendship with Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Wish we weren\u2019t so far from my parking space."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Where?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Is he making any progress? Because I\u2019d like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t think George Lucas put his headquarters in the middle of nowhere because he wanted people dropping in."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Do you understand why people don\u2019t want to play with you?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You\u2019re gonna have to be quieter than that."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Why are you crying?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Sorry. I need to work on this engine so when I get to the train yard I won\u2019t look foolish."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"We don\u2019t say that either. I\u2019ll make you a list."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You might want to check YouTube."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"We\u2019re gonna have so much more fun than him."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well I don\u2019t have any. You\u2019re kind of making me look bad."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m actually more of a theorist."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You don\u2019t need chopsticks this is Thai food."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m quite familiar with plumbing. Not to brag but I spent most of fifth grade with my head in a toilet."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Beats the hell out of me."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh no no. We said we were going to hang out let\u2019s hang out."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh too bad well I got to get to rehearsal see you guys."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Not much but he seemed to be in a pretty good place."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":" Good morning."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I never realized this building was classified."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m not being weird. I it\u2019s hard to explain."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh oh good because um his mother called me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon don\u2019t you think you\u2019re overreacting?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Looks good."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"So you\u2019re a dental student? Hmm are you aware that dentists have an extremely high suicide rate? Not as high as say air traffic controllers but then there are far more dentists than air traffic controllers so in pure numbers you\u2019re still winning."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You know it\u2019s bad enough what happened but then he tried to hide the fact that he sees her all the time at the university."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s like when I started doing chin-ups I didn\u2019t want you to see until I could do one. FYI really close."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Who\u2018s there?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Unbelievable."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Given that when we met her she was finishing law school and planning an internship at a large Indian car company it\u2019s actually extremely plausible."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I was talking with Penny."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":" Penny."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sorry."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And a funny Greek letter."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You really think so?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Potato clock. Do potato clock."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No turbulence is just the equalization of diurnal temperature variations in the atmosphere. I\u2019m not scared at all.

It\u2019s not a part I care for but such is my burden."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well he\u2019s not doing twenty-minute abs because if he were he would have way better abs. Can you hear anything?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"May I point out that for eight long months I suffered in silence as your female companion filled our apartment with her off-key country music caterwauling the unappetizing spectacle of her grinding a pumice stone against her calloused feet in our living room and night after night of uninformative TV documentaries about the Jersey Shore."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hmm. Eat one of your Luna bars. Very often when women think they\u2019re angry they\u2019re really just hungry."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You remember Sheldon and Raj and Howard."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Ah! A vintage mint in box 1975 Mego Star Trek transporter with real transporter action.

Come on."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Holy crap are we nerdy."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"So walk home."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s called parallel play."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well to celebrate this reconciliation let\u2019s all share a milk shake. Uh Penny you\u2019ll need a straw."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"As a matter of fact I did. I\u2019ve spent so many years living in fear saying no to new experiences but from now on I\u2019m gonna say yes yes to love yes to adventure yes to life. Whatever it may be the answer\u2019s going to be yes."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No but I was awake all night."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Easy.

The only thing I\u2019ve learned in the last two hours is that American men love drinking beer pee too often and have trouble getting erections."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Ah I also made oatmeal."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"This is all your fault I should\u2019ve listened to Mun-Mun because I\u2019ve been playing with a cobra and her name is Penny. Why are you so cruel? Do you enjoy my pain?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right let me show you some of the features of the room. First windows. Conventional. Open closed open closed halfway open or halfway closed depending on your philosophical bent. Over here is my comic book collection. Feel free to browse. There\u2019s a box of disposable reading gloves on the night stand."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m starting to get a sense of it. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll take you to the dentist tomorrow."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Big boy!  Someone touched my board. Oh God my board. Leonard!

Are you kidding? We\u2019re not hanging it."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It was a tutorial. And yes I\u2019m happy to keep Sheldon company."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Or maybe she doesn\u2019t. Let\u2019s find out."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Totally guys are the worst. I mean look at me. I let Emily make me a frittata and I kept the leftovers in Claire\u2019s fridge that night. I\u2019m such a dog."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Dude my accent is brilliant.  Hey my snow-white American friends let\u2019s put some cow meat on the barbecue and eat it until we\u2019re all obese."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"My primary concern with being granted tenure is living with an insanely jealous roommate after the fact. I might need to sleep with a gun under my pillow. Or a chainsaw."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard i\u2019ve been meaning to ask you what size shoe do you wear?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Uh Sheldon I didn\u2019t see your present."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Come on everyone to the hospital."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay good night."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah toddlers do that."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh come on I brought you one too."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh see?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay that\u2019s it I don\u2019t know how but she is cheating. No-one can be that attractive and be this skilled at a video game."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Penny."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh there you are. Just so you know I was up all night but I have finally completed the Penny-specific section of the new roommate agreement."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"How could you do that to me? You know I\u2019ve been working it with Alex for weeks."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No that\u2019s not fair either."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Howard did you want your clothes arranged seasonally or by colour?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Roger Abbott Roger Abbott Roger Abbott.

Roger Abbott Roger Abbott."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You mean my cello?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":" Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I\u2019m sorry that\u2019s ambiguous. Is it five minutes apart starting at the top of the hour or five minutes apart starting with the first contraction so essentially like 65 minutes?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Actually science is my lady."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah well not necessary. We broke up again."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re tying my hands here."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And then declaring the party a fiasco and storming out leaving him humiliated in front of his guests. Love it."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Sorry. Better?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What\u2019s the big deal?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well that would raise a number of problems. We\u2019re colleagues. I\u2019m currently in a relation\u2026 Excuse me a moment."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Problem?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I can\u2019t believe they kicked you out."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I said stay. I\u2019m going to work. Do not follow me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You know how when you\u2019re sick you\u2019re allowed to be cranky and say whatever you want and other people\u2019s feelings don\u2019t matter?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Excuse me. I have to break up with my girlfriend."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s true. In 1982 Wil played the voice of Martin the mouse in The Secret of NIMH. You moved me."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"If you were having Sheldon\u2019s baby would you really want him in the room?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t know what that means."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I think you made that very clear."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So in conclusion the data show that at temperatures approaching absolute zero the moment of inertia changes and the solid becomes a super-solid which clearly appears to be a previously unknown state of matter.  Are there any questions?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That is a lovely story um are we going to do anything about Sheldon?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Will you relax? I\u2019ll get it in a minute. Hey how was work?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh so there\u2019s no job?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You know guys when facing disappointment Eat Pray Love teaches us\u2013"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You were okay with that?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Your meme hypothesis does intrigue me. How might we examine this more closely?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"So how\u2019s your apartment?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Fine you drink it."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh my God what happened?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Ow. That was your fault."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well I\u2019m a Hindu. My religion teaches that if we suffer in this life we are rewarded in the next. Three months at the North Pole with Sheldon and I\u2019m reborn as a well-hung billionaire with wings!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What do you mean?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"To comfort you of course. No that\u2019s not going to work at all I\u2019ll comfort you from over here. Leonard what you\u2019re experiencing is a classic Jungian crisis in which the aging individual mourns the loss of the never-to-be realized ideal family unit."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Ooh low-techie-techie. So what are you working on right now?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"My pants are missing I don\u2019t remember anything. Penny this is your youth. What do I do?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I can\u2019t even believe this. You know maybe you should just go."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh damn they cancelled my Visa. Oh yay a new MasterCard!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"But I said I\u2019m sorry."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I appreciate your interest in the apartment. I just need to ask you a few standard questions."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Ah!"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well uh for one thing you have bigger emotional problems than I do and I find that very attractive in a woman. I I don\u2019t know. I just I think you\u2019re wonderful."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m going to invite her over. We\u2019ll have a nice meal and chat."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Knowing them they will."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"That\u2019s Professor Wilkinson\u2019s wife she\u2019s like 80 years old."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Fine. With."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well you remember when you told me I talk in my sleep? Well it occurred to me that like most things I say it\u2019s probably pure gold. So I started recording it all and now Alex gets to comb through eight hours of what I like to call Sheldon After Dark."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"We could go up to Big Bear and get a house on the lake."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Wait twice?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m confused. I was given an understanding that you allow your friends time on the machine?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh. Wow. Good for you. "},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"See what?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Do not adjust the dosage. You nailed it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What is the problem?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No our names are on the sign-in sheet."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m no stranger to memetic epidemiology. At Johnson Elementary School the phrase Shelly Cooper\u2019s a smelly pooper spread like wildfire."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I can\u2019t. I\u2019m too sick. Go away."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay well your friend and his mother are there we\u2019re going."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Double Stuf?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Great."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Preach."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Look I know you were just trying to help with your Star Wars thing. I didn\u2019t mean to call it idiotic."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Just sit here."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I really don\u2019t get your problem with birds."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Thank you. I assume you\u2019d like to reopen our dialogue about the university forcing me to continue with string theory?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well when challenged monkeys generally assert their dominance through chasing assault and a stylized penile display. That\u2019s a little outside my comfort zone."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"She\u2019s tired that was funny."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"She was looking for a husband so she can appear to be straight. And you know it sounded crazy to me at first but I\u2019m actually thinking about doing it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well what difference does it make? If you\u2019re moving back to India we\u2019re obviously breaking up."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well that wasn\u2019t as entertaining as when he rents bowling shoes but it was right up there."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay okay guys new back stories. Uh Penny and Leonard you two lovebirds are super successful and living in New York. Uh you\u2019re an actress you\u2019re a professor and you have three beautiful kids."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Not me I\u2019m a hundred percent honest in all of my relationships."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Wouldn\u2019t you rather bring Sheldon?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes he won\u2019t let go of my comic book."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Please."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019ll do what I can. But it\u2019s not going to be easy because when I\u2019m with Amy and our bathing suit areas mush together boy howdy is it magic"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m not afraid of you any more Jimmy. Now get out!  Uh-oh."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re thinking of the moving assembly line an understandable but not excusable mistake. No. The moving assembly line that was introduced by Henry Ford in 1908. That innovation is what made possible our modern consumer culture by enabling a low-unit cost for manufactured goods. I guess that isn\u2019t one of the topics discussed on your Radiohead."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No I do. You\u2019re upset about Emily and you\u2019re Indian. I need to make you chai tea. Now I have all the ingredients except cardamom seeds. Do you happen to have any on you?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Ooh I don\u2019t like where this is going."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Nice shot."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Done. You understand that moving forward we deal with the fact that my mother does not approve of you?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay thanks anyway. Bye. Well his fianc\u00e9e thought the idea of us working together was stupid. You were right I was wrong. Aren\u2019t you gonna say anything?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hugh."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hello dear friends. And Dr. Hofstadter."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I\u2019d like a drink."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"And when you go to a Chinese restaurant he always gets the same fortune in his fortune cookie."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Or possibly Durham North Carolina."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh my God Howard. That\u2019s the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever heard. And it came out of you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You know it might be fun. You love hummus."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t understand why I can\u2019t talk at this meeting."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Come on Dennis I\u2019ll show you the rec centre they\u2019ve got nautilus equipment."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You\u2019re blowing this for me!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Given that Saint Valentine was a third century Roman priest who was stoned and beheaded wouldn\u2019t a more appropriate celebration of the evening be taking one\u2019s steady gal to witness a brutal murder?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah that\u2019s true. In fact they liked the song so much they retooled the whole script around it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Penny you\u2019re always welcome to stay with us."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It\u2019s okay."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Um hey Wil. What you doin\u2019?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Too bad your show is done. I kind of liked it. Leonard did you hear that? Oh the people are heartbroken. I can\u2019t take this away from the world. Fun with Flags is back."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I do like the X-Men."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey for the record Jimmy wasn\u2019t the reason I wet the bed. That one has my mother written all over it."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh get over yourself it\u2019s a high-tech toilet."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What? Who would tell you something like that? Why would you tell her something like that?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Check."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"The prospect of fried chicken."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"There. Done."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well that can\u2019t be right."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Why?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Without."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"That\u2019s exactly what she said. How do you know that?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Nope. It\u2019s exactly as lousy as advertised. Speaking of friends they have been asking to meet you. I was thinking maybe we could all hang out sometime?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"\u202dYeah. It\u2019s a dinky little convention where they sell collectibles and get sad D-list celebrities to appear. Why?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well that wasn\u2019t as entertaining as when he rents bowling shoes but it was right up there."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s okay. Lactose intolerance is nothing to be embarrassed about."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What exactly does that mean?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well I\u2019m a lot less likely to see an Eastern Goldfinch or be murdered I\u2019ll tell you that."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hello."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019ll sit over there it looks cleaner."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Take us to a place we can waltz."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I suppose you could have your android penis circumcised. But that\u2019s something your Rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturers."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Uh it\u2019s okay sweetie good news Leonard\u2019s home!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So how was work today?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"My God who\u2019s the dork now? Thank you for wearing your flats."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well do you really think I have a shot?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh you\u2019re welcome. Of course I couldn\u2019t get you into the VIP section because you know that\u2019s for VIPs and you guys are just you know Ps."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019ve had it for a couple years not important. Penny will you marry me?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I went and looked. It was a high and tiny window. She must have been very motivated."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hi. Hi. Yeah it\u2019s Raj.

Is she lost?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Keep it up?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Shrewd."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I was sleeping."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Are you are you sure?

Brilliant."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well then why are you doing it?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"But I used science to construct the perfect joke."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"So Bernadette have you thought about how you\u2019re going to redecorate this place?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well let\u2019s see. We might consider Schrodinger\u2019s Cat."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t know what colour lonely is."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh you will. That\u2019s why they give you the bucket. Uh-oh."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Wonder why she didn\u2019t tell me."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Not getting to see who wins at pigeon ping-pong comes to mind."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh he\u2019s all bent out of shape about having a roommate agreement meeting."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I wonder if he\u2019s listening to our music right now."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay\u2026 I just\u2026 I kind of\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Fine.

She doesn\u2019t want to talk."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Are you going to confront Penny?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"No no no no I think it just means it\u2019s the kind of sauce that mobsters like."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Huh. Yeah I always took it literally. That\u2019s why I have never once moved my bowels in this or any restaurant. Hmm."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Thank you. Have you chosen one to copulate with?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m not saying you have to ask my permission but you could have talked to me about it before you said it was okay."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Simple subtraction will tell you it\u2019s six better."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh!"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Dude."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Right."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Try and stop me."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What the balls is forty-three?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well he could have been hit by a bus.

As a matter of idle curiosity which of your shrubberies do you feel would benefit from a thorough vomiting? Never mind I\u2019ll choose.  You were so good in Stand by Me."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey so what did you guys think of the new episode of Caprica last night?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"May I come in?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Only you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah that\u2019ll slow it down."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Am I allowed to ask how the class is going?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Very comforting.

Ionised plasma?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What you doing?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"By the time I was born Voyager 1\u2019s mission was supposed to be over. It had seen Jupiter and Saturn and all their moons but it kept going. When I left India for America I was never more scared in my life. I had no idea what lay ahead. Whenever I feel that way I think about how Voyager is still out there somewhere beyond our solar system going further than anyone ever thought it could. Don\u2019t leave. You can do this."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What can we do that\u2019s different?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Here day one uh this was the seat I was going to sit in but didn\u2019t because there were cracker crumbs on it. As it was first class I suspect Ritz. This is the train bathroom. This is the Imodium I took so I would never have to use the train bathroom."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You have lost so much weight! That must have been difficult for you because you were so so fat! Do you remember?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You know I have always thought that this couch would look fantastic on the curb in front of the building."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t see why that\u2019s surprising. I excel at so many things. You\u2019ve had my sourdough bread."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah I can see how that would\u2026 a bunch of people?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh sweetie it was the best speech I\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Thank you. I\u2019m gonna go next door and play with Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"With a woman you were chasing through a park? That\u2019s not a shot that\u2019s a felony. What\u2019s worse it cost me my prized Patang fighting kite. Sheldon I don\u2019t suppose there\u2019s any chance you could give me my kite back?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Then what can I do?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"My shirt is itchy and I wish I were dead."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well it\u2019s hardly my business what you eat as long as it doesn\u2019t crunch during the film and it\u2019s Raisinets."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Before I tell you perhaps I should soften the blow. You\u2019re face is pleasingly symmetrical."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"So I read a study that says a man with a dog is three times more likely to get a woman\u2019s phone number."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Mai du lui tsa."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"If you weren\u2019t screwing around with Sheldon\u2019s assistant none of this would be happening."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Do another one do another one."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh yeah I\u2019d have to say it\u2019s the most exiting time in the history of the field."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh look at you the little engineer that could."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You\u2019re a good son.

Oh sweetie you really don\u2019t have to."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hey uh thanks for keeping me company."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I have never been more attracted to a woman who sounds like a man in my life."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah well he brought a book okay?

But apparently I misread those signals."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"To that point it occurs to me that we might have an opportunity to finally snare Best Group Costume if we shore up our weak link which is clearly Leonard as Superman."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You whistled?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"My credibility may have been damaged\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You aren\u2019t you gonna come with me?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Forget about the bobcat."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh-huh I can already feel it working."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I was working with Dave Underhill."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t need to outrun him I just need to outrun you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh.

Look at you with your pouty bee-stung lips."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well The point is if this got out it would destroy Howard and Raj\u2019s friendship."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Who\u2019s the duchess?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh okay well then calm down."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s it.

That helps."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No no no you don\u2019t get it um Howard enable public access."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Just for the record when you enter five million three hundred eighteen thousand and eight in a calculator upside-down it spells boobies."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"And it only took 28 minutes."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I almost met someone last night but I blew it. I was walking Cinnamon and this girl introduced herself but she was so cute I panicked and said wouldn\u2019t it be easier if instead of talking we could just sniff each other\u2019s butts?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Don\u2019t know."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh no not at all. No we uh found a place online that uh repurposes diamond drill bits."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I love that one."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"S\u2019mores huh?

You\u2019re a weird little guy."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t think the lever\u2019s working."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Listen uh there\u2019s something I want to talk to you about. I I wasn\u2019t ready until now but I think it\u2019s time."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Why did you need a belt?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Did you let Wil Wheaton get in your head?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What about that little cup they give you?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Why me?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No you\u2019re totally right. She could be skinny \u2019cause she\u2019s dying."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well aren\u2019t you sweet?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hello."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"There are no do-overs in Wii bowling."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Not a chance."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t understand. You were happy to do this when I hired you. Why why are you upset with me now?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I can\u2019t help it. But look I figured I could sit around and feel insecure or I could do something about it. So I got a course catalogue at school and looked at some of the science classes."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey you got Snoopy out. Can I have a snowcone?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"How could you send her away?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m glad I told you about the storage unit."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Cheers."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh sweetie it\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t want tea."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You know \u2019cause \u2019cause a lot of people lose their virginity on prom night."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Who was he?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"He won\u2019t say. He just smiles and eats macaroons out of his bat jar."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Welcome to the building."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"In the past you\u2019ve come to me when I\u2019m struggling with a dilemma."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hello."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Because I\u2019m Frodo."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well now I can\u2019t blow this thing off without being a bitch."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What? This is not a problem okay? If you don\u2019t want to know I don\u2019t have to tell you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Raj is probably right. You should get someone to give you some pointers."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Come on you guys let it go."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well until they invent nose condoms I\u2019m not finding out."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You\u2019re nitpicking."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"So where\u2019s your roommate tonight?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Do you mind if I spend the weekend playing video games with the guys?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I know right?

Hell is real."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m going out for a while."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And you know why? \u2018Cause you\u2019re a man. The champagne of genders."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well you know whenever you and I would try to hit on women in bars and they\u2019d blow us off and then we\u2019d tell each other they were probably gay. It\u2019s like that. Except this time it\u2019s true."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay come on I don\u2019t even have my own house I\u2019m going to build one for someone else?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"In this context for me could mean with me."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"He is kind of a weirdo. Maybe he\u2019s got Leonard Nimoy chained up in there. Or Bill Gates. Or Stephen Hawking."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh good."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Say what you will about the healthcare system in this country but when they\u2019re afraid of lawsuits they sure test everything."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Why?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Ooh dark matter. We better bring a flashlight. I was making a joke."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well Sheldon it took me all morning but I found the owner of the video store. And I am happy to report that he died peacefully in his sleep drunk at the bottom of a pool. Anyway there is no one to return the DVD to so this issue is resolved. Ah! And I\u2019d just like to point out that even though the sweater was uncomfortable I didn\u2019t use it as an excuse to antagonize everyone around me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon I\u2019ve got some bad news."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hey don\u2019t talk to her like that.

Tator tots and a party invitation? What a great day!"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"There\u2019s been a problem with an experiment. A bird got into the clean room."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I may not be liking this game so much."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"No she didn\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"We haven\u2019t established that I\u2019m wrong once."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re welcome. Point of inquiry why did you put your car key in the door lock?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Kripke? Is that you?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You don\u2019t have to leave."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard I assumed you knew. The ranking of relationships in our circle by quality is me and Amy Howard and Bernadette Raj and his girlfriend Penny and Chardonnay Penny and you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Sorry I have company."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I believe that uh we just killed a dragon. While the others pillage the corpse I lead you to a secluded area where I attempt to remove your leather armour.  It comes off."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Come on it\u2019s Christmas just give me this one."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Now I\u2019m thinking about Jell-O."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I know you\u2019re joking but I\u2019d be okay with that."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"When I was six they told me Batman was coming to my party. I waited by the door for hours.

Where the noble semi-skilled labourers execute the vision of those who think and dream. Hello oompah-loompahs of science."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Uh maybe it\u2019ll come up when I apply for citizenship. Oh crap what if it comes up when I apply for citizenship?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well have fun tonight."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay. Oh it\u2019s a bowling alley."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Do you see me drinking lemonade?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Given the reaction to my costume this party is a scathing indictment of the American education system."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Come and get it."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay uh will I get to see you tomorrow?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh the poor guy\u2019s so lonely. We should set him up with someone."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well no. It\u2019s not cool. If there were reserved seating and we all had tickets that would be fine. But this line is first-come first-served. Not show up tardy and nevertheless be first served. Right here."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Of course I could."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"So are you worried because he\u2019s replacing you as a son or are you worried because he\u2019s becoming her lover?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I had no choice he cried in front of her."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well I think I came up with a pretty good solution."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You get that these are personalised action figures."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay moving on. Now who are these guys at Disney World?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Not quite accurate. The Macy\u2019s balloons are filled with helium whereas Leonard produces copious amounts of methane."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I am."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Don\u2019t flatter yourself dude. I want to go out and meet a woman."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Isn\u2019t that terrific? He is such a good friend. You know what the best thing about friends is?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Huh. That is so strange. Human Resources wants to talk to me tomorrow.  Could you stop licking your ass for two minutes? I have a problem here."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Could you two really have some sort of super-intelligent child?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You did?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s a good thing you\u2019re cute."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It\u2019s open."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Like what?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Let\u2019s go."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You and I never just hang out like this. Why is that?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Why?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon what are you doing?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You really think there\u2019s some kind of scientific discovery in here?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Still get in."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"And no one told me?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"That\u2019s no reason to back out. You know I once got a pretty big honour in high school and I was terrified about appearing in front of a big crowd but I went through with it and you know what? The world looked pretty darn good sitting on a haystack in the back of a Ford F-150 as a member of the Corn Queen\u2019s court."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Maybe. Why not? Who do I have in my life to watch my figure for?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh hey."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Why not?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I imagine there aren\u2019t many kosher corn-huskers."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay really? So you\u2019d be fine if I went back to acting and waiting tables again?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well but what kind of scientists would we be drawing a conclusion after only 12 hours of data?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well anyway I\u2019ll leave you to your girls\u2019 night."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay and after all that you just moved in?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Laminate the core material."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Better. It has a gold crown. You see the king wondered how much gold was in it and charged Archimedes with coming up with the solution. Because the crown was irregularly shaped there was no way to mathematically determine its volume. But while bathing Archimedes realized he could immerse the crown and measure the amount the water rose."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh I\u2019m gonna do a pre-cry before I go in there. Really dry myself out."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Mmm. Amy that pudding was delicious."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Even drunk he\u2019s still smarter than all of us."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay how about this. Even Spock had a date once every seven years."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You know if I made more money I could take time off from work and give pretty girls submarine rides."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Potty is innocent. Potty is adorable."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019d like to weigh in here. No."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh dear Lord yes yes oh yes! Amy I\u2019ve never been touched like this before! Oh!

Us gonna tell him?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Raj please let\u2019s stay serious here. Superman\u2019s body is Kryptonian therefore his sweat is Kryptonian."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hello-lo-lo."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh. I was just kind of hoping you were drunk. Now we\u2019re back live."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard as your friend I feel I should tell you something."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well done Dr. Koothrappali."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Why not?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Shh! Ramona\u2019s sleeping on the couch."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You know what I mean could you just give us a little privacy?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right.

Do you want to come?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t know. Because we don\u2019t have a date?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hey isn\u2019t that Professor Proton?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t really go by Lenny but that\u2019s okay. Um you remember Sheldon Howard and Raj."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard don\u2019t be fooled. I\u2019m from Texas Me-hi-co is Spanish for Mexico."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s like you said you\u2019re my girlfriend."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Turned to boom-boom."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m getting worried."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hey uh Bernadette let\u2019s test this theory.

It was like a little uh thunderstorm on my face. But I\u2019m a man okay? So I need to pull myself together pick up a pen and get it all out in my journal. I mean it\u2019s not all bad right? Having my heart broken has allowed me to finally speak in front of you so you know a silver lining\u2026."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I must say I was surprised you chose to spend our date night in your apartment.

As a bit of an elephant seal buff the more accurate comparison would be when two mother seals actively seek to nourish the same pup.

Happy Star Wars Day."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Why don\u2019t I just start? Sometimes people have trouble accepting accolades if on a subconscious level they don\u2019t feel they deserve them. Do you think maybe that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"But wouldn\u2019t Man-Batman just be a Batman that was bitten by a radioactive man?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"How is that going to help them?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh that part wasn\u2019t so bad.

And what did he do?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So what? Why do you even care?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well it took a little negotiating but I wore him down.

What\u2019s up? How would I know if Leonard\u2019s at work or not? Don\u2019t be suspicious.

You owe me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Don\u2019t ask me. I\u2019m just a simple seamstress whose descendants are out to make a quick buck."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It might speak to a cultural aspiration to have one\u2019s children enter the medical profession."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Mmm I know the feeling.

After we got undressed and jumped in bed you you asked if I had protection."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I know. It\u2019s not fair. Let the anger go buddy. You just you relax all your muscles.

It was funny."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah that list is strong. Like your mother\u2019s urge to be promiscuous with sailors."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Or the first door closing causes a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You\u2019re not being very nice."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t know.

There go my chances of being sexually harassed."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well how would I know?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I get that. Hey you want to just bring a few people in here? You know Wil Wheaton in the bathtub Batman on the toilet. It\u2019ll be like the weirdest Comic-Con ever."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"If she doesn\u2019t think that we should apply for this patent she\u2019s being patently absurd."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m getting to it. "},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Of course. I\u2019m already seeing a more efficient way of taming the ultravi\u2026 I know why the song was in my head."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Under my authority as a self-appointed member of the Centres for Disease Control street team these premises are condemned.  Penny."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well uh to paraphrase Shakespeare It\u2019s better to have loved and lost than to stay home every night and download increasingly shameful pornography."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"The two signals meet up in the corpus callosum and T equals zero. And I know a boy who just earned a slurp of soup."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes. Leonard\u2019s work is nearly as amazing as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels.  While I appreciate the oh snap I\u2019m uncomfortable having your moist breath in my ear."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No this is my home now. Thanks to you my career is over and I will spend the rest of my life here in Texas trying to teach evolution to creationists."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Don\u2019t worry you\u2019ll find another job."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What if I knocked you unconscious right now?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I\u2019m sorry what?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What was that?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah I need to start cracking the window when I leave you in the car."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You\u2019re in a soup kitchen not a production of Oliver!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Check it out.

If you wanted someone weak and spineless you could walk all over you should have asked Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I do. Leonard never cooks for me."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey you guys ready to order?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What\u2019s the exchange rate."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What a stupid question."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Let\u2019s see Raj was the Kung Palo Chicken."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s like living with a Chihuahua."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d say you\u2026 oh."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey congratulations Bert."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well she\u2019s due tomorrow. Although it did take her six years to finish high school so who knows?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What? Just because I\u2019m Indian I can\u2019t be a Norse God? No no no Raj has to be an Indian God. That\u2019s racism. I mean look at Wolowitz he\u2019s not English but he\u2019s dressed like Peter Pan. Sheldon is neither sound nor light but he\u2019s obviously the Doppler Effect."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019ll add it right now. Oh baby it\u2019s addendum time."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"It\u2019s not funny."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"The line of scrimmage is the imaginary transverse line separating the offence from the defence."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t like this game."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Bazinga! You\u2019ve fallen victim to another one of my classic practical jokes. I\u2019m your boss now. You may want to laugh at that."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What? What are you doing back?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hi."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s an observational rebuttal of the Lambda-CDM model of the universe."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes. Not sold separately. Although the PS4 uses cool new GDDR5 RAM while the Xbox One is still using the conventional DDR3 memory."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":" Wil Wheaton! Wait how many was that?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh please. The only way she could make a contribution to science would be if they resume sending chimps into space."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh come on you can\u2019t say oh my and then not tell me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thank you so much for letting us pick your brain."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey guys."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You know I apologise for my earlier outburst who needs Halo when we can be regaled with the delightfully folksy tale of the whore of Omaha?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Can you?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah and I checked. Not letting the bike fall on you while standing still is lesson one."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You guess? You don\u2019t seem to have much of a handle on this."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No it isn\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey I know tons of people who got married in Vegas."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What are you talking about? They\u2019ve always known where you live."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No that\u2019s the least of our worries. I\u2019ve been doing some research on addiction both the biochemical and behavioural aspects and I think there\u2019s a problem with the current version of our lie."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well I do. Next to you I\u2019ll look like a catch."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Is it my fault I have a much bigger reputation than he does?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay.  Okay yep we\u2019re all done now. It\u2019s just it\u2019s good. Let me just take that away from you. Okay."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"March 18th. You violated my rule about forwarding email humour."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Thank you for coming by gentlemen."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Absolutely. But don\u2019t be surprised if this movie sets you on the straight and narrow."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What about Joss Whedon\u2019s work makes you think he\u2019d be okay with rule-breakers and line-cutters?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m not crazy. My mother had me tested."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Good-bye Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Doesn\u2019t that violate the health code?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Why? I said I didn\u2019t care."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Excuse me I\u2019ll be right back. Don\u2019t go anywhere. Don\u2019t move. Just stay the beautiful unspoiled American flower that you are.  What\u2019s wrong with you dude that woman was all up in my jammy."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yeah I know you\u2019re teasing but watch out for karma."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Uh well it\u2019s a little juvenile. I mean it kind of looks like the MySpace page of a 13-year-old girl."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well he\u2019s having a rough time. Amy broke his heart the DVR cut off the last minute of Doctor Who. That crow followed him home."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Look let\u2019s be reasonable. We all want to do different things with the ring but your ideas are stupid and I want a jet ski."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"But I\u2019m Green Lantern."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I took a little lady I like to call loneliness."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh. Go away Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You know sometimes I think I\u2019ve made you so much cooler than you used to be and then you go and do that."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Fine. Here I go taking one for the team. In the sack. Hey Leslie."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh that would be great."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Ta-da. It\u2019s short for da-da-da-da!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Good. I thought she saw something on my forehead."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Can you?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Do you really think death threats are an appropriate way to begin this conversation? Sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Your mee-maw died? That\u2019s terrible."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What? Is it wrong? Have you seen it somewhere else?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well you know how you\u2019re always saying that Amy is a girl who\u2019s your friend and not your girlfriend?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What? No no I just put it on the other hand and turn it around. Keep that hand in my pocket."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Alright I think we\u2019re going to need some ground rules in addition to the expected no shoes in the time machine and no eating in the time machine I propose that we add pants must be worn at all times in the time machine."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yes so I was just warming up some milk for Halley and I thought it smelled a little funky so I checked the date that you wrote on the bottle and it says Flerbsday."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No. No if I can walk past that pet shop with the parrot in the window I suppose I can do this."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"But it\u2019s true. But we-we put all your vital information into this dating site answered all their questions just like you would and they found a match for you. Her name is Amy Farrah Fowler."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"On a ship? Aren\u2019t they afraid Hawking will just roll overboard?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh hey. Sorry Sheldon I\u2019ll move."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh fun. Let me see. Uh no no uh definitely not."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah but you just have to remember that ride is shorter than you think and they take a picture of you at the end so make sure you got your clothes back on. It\u2019s a joke. Based on real events."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"If you\u2019re not into this we can do it another time."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Very impressive. You know when you\u2019re done with that can you look at this? It doesn\u2019t make smoke anymore."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh. It\u2019s wonderful and I swear I\u2019m not saying that because Justin Timberlake is in it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You\u2019ve been giving me a hard time and you haven\u2019t even told your mom about Sheldon?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I came to say I\u2019m sorry."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You know those girls text me every detail of their lives as it happens."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hummingbirds are pretty."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"See? Howard\u2019s on my side."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"We still on for tomorrow night?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No I can\u2019t. I need to make preparations for Amy\u2019s birthday. Which leads me to the following bit of business. This is my ticket to Star Wars. I don\u2019t have to tell you it is worth far more than its face value of fifteen dollars and fifty cents. I trust you\u2019ll give it to someone worthy."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Mrs. Latham the first machine I turn on in the morning is the helium-neon laser \u2019cause it needs to warm up."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Would it be helpful to you if I told you about my dreams?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Just walk."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh so it\u2019s like The View."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh dear.

That poster of Halle Berry\u2019s a little unnerving."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"As a rule no."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah to be honest I don\u2019t see much difference."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"He doesn\u2019t just put on a pair of glasses. He combs back his curlicue and affects a mild-mannered personality."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No you didn\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey shouldn\u2019t you be out with your gang spray painting equations on the side of buildings?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No no no no I didn\u2019t forget. Um there\u2019s this cat in a box and until you open it it\u2019s either dead or alive or both. Although back in Nebraska our cat got stuck in my brother\u2019s camp trunk and we did not need to open it to know there was all kinds of dead cat in there."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay. One of the things that might help you in connecting with your students is being a little more spontaneous. So why don\u2019t we try some improvisation?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Going to Wheaton\u2019s party is not betraying you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes. I think prolonged exposure to Penny has turned her into a bit of a Gabby Gertie."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay. Okay thank you. Oh if she\u2019s scared you can sing to her. She likes Katy Perry. Oh but don\u2019t do Firework that gets her all riled up."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I know but\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I see. Is that decision open for discussion?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Really? This is going to decide who\u2019s the hero and who\u2019s the sidekick?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"When I thought the element was real I didn\u2019t want it. But now that Leonard made it not exist I want it more than anything in the world."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yes. It\u2019s all on you. But I got to tell you when the time comes I want the whole nine yards.

I\u2019ve known you for seven years and I can barely tolerate sitting on the couch with you.

Anyway if it would please the court I\u2019d like to begin with an opening statement."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"In anticipation of their arrival I\u2019ve bagged some evidence.

My apologies. I would\u2019ve been here sooner but the bus kept stopping for other people to get on it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t want another parking space. I want my parking space. It\u2019s perfect. It\u2019s a corner spot cutting the risk of door-dings in half. It\u2019s a mere 28 steps from the building entrance. The nearby tree provides shade on hot days and is also home to a delightful squirrel. Which is fortuitous because most squirrels are real jerks."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah now about those uh they came from a costume shop and all they had left was sexy graduate so they might be a little short."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Look you know I love you but but you\u2019re you\u2019re drunk and sad and feeling lost."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"With Penny and me it took two years.

Hey let me see your phone."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It\u2019s very simple. For breakfast she has an egg-white frittata. Feel free to give her a choice of home fries or an English muffin but not both. We\u2019re watching our weight. Uh for dinner something simple a veal chop some scampi whatever you like."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"He\u2019s engaging in reductio-ad-absurdum. It\u2019s the logical fallacy of extending someone\u2019s argument to ridiculous proportions and then criticising the result and I do not appreciate it."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh I know why don\u2019t we get started on clearing out the baby\u2019s room?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Does anyone have any words they\u2019d like to say about our man of the evening?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon you just can\u2019t dictate\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You do that?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh thanks man."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What\u2019s that?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Very nice.

There are some girls right over there. What are you waiting for?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"When does a monkey have a trunk?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You shush I\u2019m happy I want to talk about it.

May I suggest it as the topic for your essay."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It just said Italian sub. I had no idea mortadella has pistachios in it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Y No. I\u2019m as much a part of this relationship as you two and I think it\u2019s high time we put all our cards on the table. For example where is this going? Are you two ever getting married? And if so where will we all live? Have you thought about that?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019d hit particulate soil on a colloidal suspension.

Hmm are you aware that dentists have an extremely high suicide rate? Not as high as say air traffic controllers but then there are far more dentists than air traffic controllers so in pure numbers you\u2019re still winning."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Chilli cheese fry?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I knew we should\u2019ve never mentioned us living together in the first place."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well if I would have been there and saw you alone I would\u2019ve asked you to dance."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"More to the point it\u2019s about finding a way to keep Leonard and Stephanie together."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Mm-hmm.

What am I gonna do?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You called my mother?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Fine. I\u2019m mad at you.

It was an overreaction to a bad zipper injury."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Dude this is this is brutal."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t see why I have to worry. My career\u2019s not hanging in the balance. That was a joke. It\u2019s funny because it\u2019s true."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You know who else said that? Every cocky T.

Hey if you ever wanna start a family La Ca\u00f1ada has some great schools."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah I picked it up without thinking about it. Which raises a neuroscientific question when did I decide to pick it up?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It was the only way to keep you from being such a huge Dickensian. You see that? I added the ensian."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well perhaps when your mother gets here she\u2019ll talk some sense into you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Legoland is not the solution to everything. And it\u2019s too much of a scene since that movie came out."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I did your horoscope remember I was going to do everybody\u2019s until Sheldon went on one of his typical psychotic rants."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right. These are the talking points for my NPR interview tomorrow. I need to make sure that they\u2019re simple enough for the less educated in the audience to understand. Howard look this over and tell me what\u2019s unclear to you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Are you suggesting I terminate my relationship with Amy?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You also made a common grammatical mistake you said nauseous when you meant nauseated.

He just thinks too much of you would be mind-numbingly tedious."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Please please I don\u2019t have a lot of time. Look Ramona finally dozed off and I need you to help me get rid of her."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yeah it\u2019s the highest rated one on the market. I wouldn\u2019t even call it a crib I\u2019d call it a Fortress of Solitude for babies."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I won! This is astonishing. Not that I won the award no one deserves it more. Actually I guess I misspoke. It\u2019s not astonishing more like inevitable. I\u2019m not sure what to do first. Maybe I should call my mother. Wait! I know I\u2019m going to conduct an interview with myself and post it online."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Since when?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well they argue all the time.

No you\u2019ll only make it worse."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey Priya."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Honey instead of worrying about pain you might cause in the future how about trying to fix the pain you\u2019re causing her right now?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"So no more interviews?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"She\u2019s upset. Look it\u2019s gonna be a great wedding. Look at you in your little suit."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Sure. It\u2019s not like I was invited to Richard Feynman\u2019s house and have anything better to do."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s no reason to cry. One cries because one is sad. For example I cry because others are stupid and it makes me sad."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I think I\u2019ll eat my lunch at home."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Its weight and smoothness along with the slight concavity of the mirror means it can spin for a long time."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Wouldn\u2019t you feel better about yourself if you were more independent?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh and how."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes exactly I had a great time.

Can they?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"If he were any bigger he\u2019d have moons orbiting him."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yes he said he was feeling guilty and wanted to do what was right."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I wouldn\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"There are a couple of things I did with Penny that might be a little silly but\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Ay-yi-yi."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"But we\u2019ll have sex first right?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well you start off by trying to make chocolate souffle and when it falls you panic quickly change the name and voila! Lava cake."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I might kill him right now."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I see. Well I assume since the rest of you have set the bar so low you\u2019re saving the most impressive contribution for last. Go ahead Howard. Dazzle me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"well no no I need something more permanent to join these papers. Say don\u2019t you keep staples in your top desk drawer?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Very well."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"She\u2019s gonna know I was looking in it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Careful it\u2019s addictive."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It only gets funnier when you explain it Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Your what?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You\u2019d have no girlfriend to see you naked you\u2019d try to fill the void with food and I\u2019m an enabler who once deep-fried a pancake."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"The housekeeper does the shopping."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well if you leave now you can be back before the gorillas rip the crap out of Charlton Heston."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So yeah anyway that\u2019s my boyfriend.

How could you not tell me your sister was moving back to India?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well even if the study\u2019s nonsense I don\u2019t believe in tempting fate. Same reason I wouldn\u2019t use a Ouija board or pick a fight with an Asian guy. He probably doesn\u2019t know karate but why risk it?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yes. If it means that much to you you should go."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re welcome Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I wish I\u2019d never gone on that trip. I feel no better now than when I left."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey guys."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"My point is I don\u2019t like when things change. So regardless of your feelings I would like you to continue dating Leonard. And also while we\u2019re on the subject you recently changed your shampoo. I\u2019m not comfortable with the new scent. Please stop this madness and go back to green apple."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"If it\u2019s okay with you I\u2019d like to go to temple."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"No you can\u2019t join us. Just go go climb back up whatever beanstalk you came down from."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey how\u2019d it go?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Howard every Thai restaurant in town knows you can\u2019t eat peanuts.

Uh to protect those involved I\u2019ll be changing their names."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Why do you care so much? You\u2019re dating my sister and Penny and I are in love."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well I\u2019m going back to India. What\u2019s your plan?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You know how the PennySaver only has my name\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Sorry it\u2019s not part of my heartwarming and personal narrative in which a humble boy from New Delhi overcame poverty and prejudice and journeyed to America to reach for the stars."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Howard and his mother are at the hospital. Come on we gotta go."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Congratulations. You\u2019re officially one of us."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Will they Leonard? "},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Another reason to consider a life of piracy. Even today I understand that\u2019s an all-male profession."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You know she seems very nice."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Then how can I say it convincingly?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"We\u2019re both frauds."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh no I wouldn\u2019t care for that. Amy?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I suppose it has something to do with your recent passing."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Uh let me ask you this. When I learn that I\u2019m a robot would I be bound by Asimov\u2019s three laws of robotics?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"But mostly here."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Too bad I called dibs."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes Lucky."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Bam. Right in the nose. Made me proud to own a PC."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"With sex."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"So what do you guys think that\u2019s about?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Let\u2019s go home. You want to get something to eat?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay I\u2019m sorry honey but the Wesley Crushers sounds like a bunch of people who like Wesley Crusher."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay then."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh right."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh pish on your issues.

The plot like my gravy thickens."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Just don\u2019t take it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s a Band-Aid at best. See the core problem is that Amy and Wil do not like each other. Which is baffling because they\u2019re both crazy about me. And I like them which indicates they\u2019re bright and interesting and\/or were on Star Trek."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"No one was writing me back so I stopped checking my profile."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay we saw them. Can we go catch the movie?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Any other questions?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Did you get my mail."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I think you\u2019ll like the drill tonight. I\u2019ve tried to make it fun. Each of these cards contains a detailed scenario of a possible apocalyptic event. Everything from wild fires to a surprise invasion by Canada.

Just straight to where\u2019s the other white guy?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh you\u2019d like to catch up on the events of the day. All right. Well there was a half-hour wait at the bank to get into my safe deposit box I was forced to talk to Penny about your sexual problems and oh yes in a moment filled with biblical resonance pride wenteth before my fall causing my Flash 123 to goeth to Wolowitz."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard Penny wants to exploit any residual feelings you have for her in order to get a ride to work."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It\u2019s true you\u2019re both gorgeous. Kind of says something about the man who could bed you both. You get why I\u2019ve been alone most of my adult life."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh sorry. We\u2019ll keep it down."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"The humorous implication being that I am Wile E. Coyote?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh she\u2019s meeting us here.

It\u2019s not that big a deal. As long as they\u2019re happy I\u2019m happy. And when I get to see them for the holidays I\u2019ll get to celebrate Diwali twice one at each house. That\u2019s double the Diwali."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay when I\u2019m done with him I\u2019m gonna need more information."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"S-Y-F-Y. Sy-fee."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You\u2019re sitting here playing video games all day."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well it\u2019s a new day. I have a new outlook. You know I realized I don\u2019t need to worry about other people. I just need to think more about myself."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Or instead of me."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh that\u2019s rough."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Forget the parties."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah right in there. She ate it and everything."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"When did you learn how to change a tyre?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"He could\u2019ve softened the blow."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Anyway we can e-mail and I think the phone connections are pretty good."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What\u2019s new at the Cheesecake Factory?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What if he lives in your garage?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right.

I just needed some time to think."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I know I may have started off with a fairly obvious one. You did an aspect of my most appealing trait playfulness. Why don\u2019t you just go ahead and write that number 1. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re on your own for the rest. It should take you no more than 3 hours."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"So that\u2019s all this day was? A plan to butter me up before delivering bad news?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Congratulations on a successful live show."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Uh okay let\u2019s see.

Uh I mean Einstein Von Brainstorm. Oh darn it! All right I guess the cat\u2019s out of the bag. Let me explain what\u2019s going on. Ricardo is really Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"So uh what game are you\u2026 Oh. Crap."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What\u2019s up with the infrared cameras?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Really? That seems rather short sighted coming from someone who is generally considered altogether unlikable. Why don\u2019t you take some time to reconsider?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"He gave me his business card and asked me to please pass it along to Howard."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Does it have melon on it?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Uh Alex a moment. I need a word with Dr. Hofstadter. Do you think it\u2019s appropriate for her to sit with us given her station?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well hey you\u2019re my dear friends. You\u2019ll get a Christmas card for a couple of years and then you\u2019re dead to me."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"And sometimes we marry them anyway."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Face it dude Bernadette treats you the same way your mother used to and that was not a healthy relationship."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What\u2019s the difference?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You did what you had to do. "},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You brought your mother into this!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh. Well you know just being myself really."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m not going to pay a fine. That would imply I\u2019m guilty."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hang on. 130 over 80. A little high. We can attribute that to the stress of sneaking past the security desk."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey there\u2019s no reason for you to be scared."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It was in my weekly e-mail blast. Right between beet season is finally here and uh-oh red stool from beets leads to cancer scare."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s odd."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard I\u2019m dying."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I\u2019d rather have Fishbine\u2019s it\u2019s bigger."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh hey if you guys are free this weekend I won a night of wine tasting from work."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Why didn\u2019t you tell me you knew Elizabeth Plimpton? I am a huge fan of hers!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Are you sure? Every time my dad stayed out all night my mom would put hamster poop in his chewing tobacco."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wear loafers. Look at Dr. Saul Perlmutter up there clutching that Nobel Prize. What\u2019s the matter Saul? You afraid someone\u2019s going to steal it? Like you stole Einstein\u2019s cosmological constant?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s a joke."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Not really."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You made Frodo pancakes?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Jerry?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Is someone there?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What people?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So who\u2019s the girl?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Like what? He\u2019ll never be able to cope with the fact that some fifteen year-old kid is smarter and more accomplished than he is."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"No no. Please don\u2019t cry."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Me too."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I know you\u2019ve been giving me secret puzzle tests."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It gets better. Instead of me you can take someone who will actually enjoy it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh for God\u2019s sake just come to the play."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re talking to one of the three men in the Western hemisphere capable of following that train of thought."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No one likes a know-it-all Penny."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh don\u2019t take it so personally maybe your baby\u2019s just a jerk."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Of course. We\u2019re coming as the Justice League of America."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What? I\u2019m annoying? You criticize my behaviour all the time. Sheldon don\u2019t talk about your bowel movements over breakfast. Sheldon when the president of the university is giving a eulogy at a funeral don\u2019t yawn and point at your watch. Sheldon don\u2019t throw away my shirts \u2019cause you think they\u2019re ugly. You\u2019re impossible."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"We do?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Be sure to check the mail."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to do that."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Thank you but cute is for bunnies. I want to be something with sex appeal like like a labradoodle."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Don\u2019t. It\u2019s terrible. However in it we learn that when Spock finds himself drawn off the path of logic by feelings bubbling up from his human half he suppresses them using the Vulcan mental discipline of Kolinar."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I kind of did. The part in that awful horror movie I passed on came back around. Apparently it\u2019s mine if I want it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Four questions. There answer\u2019s four."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"How did that even happen? Did they know that\u2019s what they were doing when they were doing it?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t understand my food. Chinese noodles with Korean barbecue in a taco."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"By staying here and watching the movie."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I can\u2019t hear you I\u2019m in the shower."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"So it was working."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Really not a good time."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh that\u2019s a rather earthy cologne. My uncle used to wear that. Perhaps we can enjoy one last meal together before Leonard returns."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I want to say something obnoxious but it is easy on the eyes."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Interesting that you ask. The Coast Starlight recently added the refurbished Pacific Parlour Car. Built in 1956 and originally known as the Santa Fe Lounge Car the lower level is a theatre\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You have to check your messages the leaving of a message is one half of a social contract which is completed by the checking of the message. If that contract breaks down then all social contracts break down and we descend into anarchy."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So no on the Shepherd\u2019s Pie. Can we move on?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"To Sheldon sorry this took so long. Your friend Wil Wheaton."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Of course there is. The Mini Cooper \u2019cause it\u2019s me."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yeah grow up Howard. God."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon are you going to introduce us?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yup she\u2019s right. For every Newton who had a psychological issue there\u2019s an Edison who was just a jerk. That could totally be you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well that means not one or not any. Maybe instead of a table you should buy a dictionary. Well I don\u2019t know if I won that but at least he\u2019s upset."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah I\u2019m good."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"And I was wondering if any of you guys would like to help me do it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"When I was five I ingested a Z gauge locomotive. I spent the next three days saying I think I can pass it I think I can pass it I think I can pass it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh I am. Maybe if you follow this trail you\u2019ll see why."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Thor said that\u2019s a nice look in nineteen fourty-foura."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Um no."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"My point is if Koothrappali is moving on to a new life of shallow undeserved fame perhaps this is an opportunity to create a better cohort."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You know I\u2019m given to understand that there is an entire city in Nevada designed specifically to help people like Howard forget their problems. Where  you can replace them with new problems such as alcoholism gambling addiction and sexually transmitted diseases."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Come here."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I\u2019m impressed. This is very lifelike."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I just got here."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay. I know I propose a lot. So how about this? I promise I will never ask you to marry me again."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"For one thing you live with your mother."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh yeah right. Wait what was your problem again?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sheldon didn\u2019t heckle him?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No it\u2019s not okay. Look at me okay? I took a temp job as a waitress forever ago and I\u2019m still doing it. I can\u2019t quit because guess what? I can\u2019t do anything else. And I finally get my big break and it goes away. I\u2019m such a mess."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I should say so he appears to be a member of the Nigerian royal family."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Here you go."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No. I got upset. And Sheldon made me a beverage too."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Just leave! Okay now. This is the way it\u2019s supposed to be. Men together fighting the forces of evil."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh my God it\u2019s seven."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon hang tight. Hey do you want me to bring anything?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Not now Leonard Michaela\u2019s inviting me to a party. You better call the moon and you make sure that they have a bed for you."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You should go to my girl. She\u2019ll knock out those sideburns for free."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re pretty I\u2019m stupid. Hello. Uh just checking again for Hofstadter. Still gonna be an hour?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So you\u2019ve really never had a birthday party?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Is that true?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"That did not clear things up."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Ooh I don\u2019t think so. No anecdotal evidence suggests that in the game of rock-paper-scissors players familiar with each other will tie 75 to 80% of the time due to the limited number of outcomes. I suggest rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"He\u2019s right. I say we call this person back. We\u2019ve got no reason to hide."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I was sleeping."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh. Hey Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I have to say this is the best Top Ramen you\u2019ve ever made."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What do you mean vastly wealthy?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hello."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You guys don\u2019t have to go to the trouble. I\u2019m back in the money now I can just buy another helicopter."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Which is why I got you this Pink Power Ranger. Put it anywhere you like."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Nailed it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sorry Sheldon it\u2019s just not a good time for playing games."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Mm-hmm International Space Station. 250 miles that way."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yay!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sheldon I really don\u2019t want to talk about this with you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes. That\u2019s what a rational person does when his entire life\u2019s work is invalidated by a post-pubescent Asian wunderkind. He ceases his fruitless efforts he donates his body to scientific research and he waits to die."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You want to drive?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sure."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No  that\u2019s ridiculous."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s pretty convincing huh? And it wasn\u2019t even a real person. And here is the clincher. A lock of Maggie\u2019s flaming auburn hair."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Nope."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You\u2019re right I\u2019m sorry. Let\u2019s watch the game."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What do you mean?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"How could you miss that?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It is. He stopped trying to find Indian girls for me to marry."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well perhaps you\u2019re obsessively picturing him engaged in drunken coitus with another woman. Is that it? Did I get it right?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"He spent the entire night bragging about how he invented the word appe-teasers."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What? That was ambiguous."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Look at you talking sports."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I don\u2019t want to talk about it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I don\u2019t know. Be cool. He\u2019s coming. He\u2019s coming. Hi."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I didn\u2019t try I succeeded. For some reason it alarmed the other passengers and I was asked to de-bus."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"How about those two?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well I think the first thing we should get rid of is that tone."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Last night I was strong-armed into an evening of harp music and spooning with an emotional Amy Farrah Fowler. This on a night that I had originally designated for solving the space-time geometry in higher-spin gravity and building my Lego Death Star. And why? Your gal pals Penny and Bernadette went out shopping for some wedding nonsense without Amy an action they took with no thought or regard as to how it would affect me the future of string theory or my Lego fun time."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Get out."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hey guys bad news. I just did a quick calculation. Given the size of the theatre  and the length of this line we might not get seats."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Mmmmmm."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It\u2019s like when you bought that remote-controlled helicopter and it just flew away."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yes?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Don\u2019t worry about the moon. We we set our laser to stun."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Even Batman breaks the rules."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Your apology is accepted."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh yeah? Can you do this? "},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey. I thought you were with your new buddies."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I did. It was beautiful."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You really think so?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Mom smokes in the car. Jesus is okay with it but we can\u2019t tell Dad."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I know. The group consensus is that his proposal will be met with an humiliating soul-crushing rejection. Everyone was set a-twitter. Although oddly no one tweeted."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"There\u2019s a can in the fridge."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well make your jokes but some of the participants who spent four days in the woods away from all technology reported a fifty percent gain in reasoning skills upon their return."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That shirt brings out the blue in your eyes."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I did."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay you don\u2019t have to say struggling every time. You can just say actress."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"They do some of their best work at night."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"This is an interesting topic. How many sexual encounters have you had?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Dad I\u2019m trying to tell you off and you\u2019re ruining it with your delight and relief."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Now open your hand and let it go."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Perfect."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What kind of emergency?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019m very comfortable here. Penny dear why don\u2019t you shoot another silver bullet my way?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey can you help me put some of the food out?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You call Koothrappali we need to find a place to lay low for the next eighteen to twenty four hours."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"So we slept together naked. It was only to keep our core body temperatures from plummeting."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019ve found an emulator online that lets you play classic text based computer games from the 1980s."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh yeah she\u2019s got puddles in all the right places."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"One ladder left."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I like the new look."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I can hear your voice coming from your bedroom."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"We\u2019re going to Disney World and ride the Matterhorn?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Thinly veiled contempt."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"For you or with you?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Have you ever heard of the Kama Sutra?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh okay okay my turn. Are you in the six Star Wars movies?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right if you must watch then mute it with closed captions please."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I thought Amy was gonna drive you home."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"She was right you know. The locus of my identity is totally exterior to me."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Are you sure? He\u2019s tall pale and awkward. That sounds like your type."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hmm? Oh I did. It hasn\u2019t stopped. I figured out a solution for our navigation system while I was pre-soaking lentils out of my pants."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay first talking to you while you\u2019re on the toilet isn\u2019t exactly a picnic for me either okay? Remember when you can hear me I can hear you. And second you completely disregard how uncomfortable unresolved issues are for me. It\u2019s it\u2019s like a an itch in my brain I can\u2019t scratch."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well maybe what\u2019s in my pants will change your mind. It\u2019s a list of this year\u2019s panelists. It\u2019s long isn\u2019t it?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Are you able to have sex with men without developing an emotional attachment?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Graduate work very impressive."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019m calling her. And the threesome didn\u2019t deserve the belly laugh it got."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"So for all the times I\u2019ve offended you and all the times that I\u2019ll offend you in the future I\u2019m sorry."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Golly she sounds too good to be true."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Boy all this standing\u2019s making me tired. Good thing I brought my collapsible stick chair."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh she is. She\u2019s terrific and she\u2019s proving to be a valuable roommate."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Give it up dude you\u2019re arguing with a crazy person."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Just say Leonard went to the office."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah. And you never will. Ooh hey oh ask her to do the tissue thing. Do it ask her."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Plus no one stole their pants."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Really? Why?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019ll be good to have him back."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Night. If we did continue living together would it be here?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Anyway uh as I was saying I was at a pretty low place in my life and uh if it wasn\u2019t for friends"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Now of course my 9am is your noon so let\u2019s avoid the whole good morning good afternoon minefield and let\u2019s just say hello."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Vegas here we come."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Party with the pretty girls dude!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Um\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Sorry it\u2019s not part of my heartwarming and personal narrative in which a humble boy from New Delhi overcame poverty and prejudice and journeyed to America to reach for the stars."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You don\u2019t know?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Uh-huh."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I have an eidetic memory. I don\u2019t know what his problem is."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Obviously I care about Leonard. I\u2019m gonna spend the rest of my life with him."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Get out."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Thank you for wearing your heels."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t know you pretty much covered it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What? I don\u2019t want to do that."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What do I have to be happy about? My life\u2019s a wreck."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I know. Do you think I should start watching The Flash TV show?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah well he does know his stuff."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Not yet."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Why yes I love to party. Party is my middle name. Or it would be if it weren\u2019t Ramayan."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"We\u2019re gonna have sex."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No of course not. I just feel bad."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Of course you do. Who could forget being that fat?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"All right you two don\u2019t start. Penny and I are throwing this second wedding for your benefit. Can you please not ruin it?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay let\u2019s focus. The girls are gone we have 48 hours. There are no distractions. Let\u2019s change the world."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"He does. And in the kitchen. And in the car. And in his pocket."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No of course not. They thrive on our suffering."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I have come to an important decision. I will not be accepting your money any more. I\u2019m a man and I can take care of myself."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Are you sure. There are a lot of advantages to buying in bulk. For example I noticed that you purchase your tampons one month\u2019s supply at a time."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I should\u2019ve peed before we left."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s even worse. Using the sweet candy of science to trick children into loving him. Pervert."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Unbelievable. "},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I caused that fight I feel terrible. Wait I can do that better. I caused that fight. I feel terrible. Yeah wow I don\u2019t know which one I like more."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"It\u2019s like if you\u2019re dating someone you\u2019re not that into and then they break up with you and then you want them more than ever."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh no no. This isn\u2019t a date no. Right?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard you are my friend. And friends support their friends apparently. So I am withdrawing my objection to your desire to have a relationship with Leslie."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay fine whatever um you guys this is my friend Eric."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey hey what the hell?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Your ex-boyfriend?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey Ames."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Alright come on come on."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah \u2019cause you sound really funny."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Mmm."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Irrelevant. The disruption in your relationship is making my life intolerable."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Huh."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I suppose I could see myself in a scientific boy band. Of course I\u2019d be the dreamy one and the smart one."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You\u2019re extorting a date out of me?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Don\u2019t know why he\u2019s so grumpy. I got mistaken for that guy in Life of Pi once and I\u2019m still floating."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What happened to all your glow-in-the-dark-emergency-exit stuff you had painted on the floor?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh yeah tonight\u2019s not great for me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Initiating rotation sequence. Don\u2019t look at me initiate. What does red and yellow mean?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Wow so how long will you be gone?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Bert I insist that you join us."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well we could if it were true. But as you live in the same building you see each other all the time. The variable which has changed is the coitus."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Keen observation goodbye."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Everything is stupid and I want to go home."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s hot chocolate with a stick of butter."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Your head goes on the other end."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s a good idea. I guess everyone\u2019s having them now."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sheldon where are you going? Aren\u2019t you going to clean this up?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey Sheldon you busy?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Excuse me the whole tenure system is ridiculous. A guaranteed job for life only encourages the faculty to become complacent. If we really want science to advance people should have chips implanted in their skulls that explode when they say something stupid."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh of course."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You know a lot of scientists believe that making contact with other life-forms would probably not end well for us."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay well that\u2019s a problem."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Emily you know almost everybody here."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Where did he pop the question? What did you say?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"No. But it\u2019s a stupid test."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Anything to drink?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Nope. Uh uh I might not know what I meant but I know that I didn\u2019t mean that. Not this guy. Oh no way."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No I\u2019ll watch the end of the game. Besides there\u2019s only three minutes left."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh oh don\u2019t get me wrong nothing happened with me and Howard. There was about 200 pounds of Sailor Moon between us."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"So does enjoying a meal at a well-lit restaurant but here we are."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Is it me or are you purposely changing the subject?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You can\u2019t wear the hands on the date."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Romantic love as the basis for marriage has only existed since the nineteenth century. Up until then arranged marriages were the norm and it served society quite well."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Who\u2019s he?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Harsh terms. But all right I\u2019ll just substitute intercourse."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Um\u2026 Well\u2026 You are black right?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That someone was Sheldon and the day was yesterday. Hey look at this. Dear Roger to be opened upon your first great discovery. Love Mom. Wow look at the date. He saved this fifty years and never got to open it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well if you were referring to her illness your question should have been what ails her?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You\u2019re welcome to try but the other day it took you 15 minutes to get into a FedEx box. "},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Because this company needs you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"We don\u2019t know his mother never had him tested."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It\u2019s nice to think that you grew up in this room and now your daughter\u2019s going to as well."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What are you waiting for? Kill Wil Wheaton! From hell\u2019s heart stab at him!"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Sheldon if this is too much we can stop."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"As a matter of fact I did. I\u2019ve spent so many years living in fear saying no to new experiences but from now on I\u2019m gonna say yes yes to love yes to adventure yes to life. Whatever it may be the answer\u2019s going to be yes."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay so we know that previous attempts to send a message into space like the Golden Record on Voyager were heavily criticized."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Look at that. You\u2019ve known you\u2019re gonna be a father for less than a day and you\u2019re already stepping up."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Eventually I guess. Although I am kind of curious how long she thinks she can keep hiding my stuff without me knowing."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well I don\u2019t want to hurt my dad. You know he always wanted to dance with his daughter at her wedding."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Dude I\u2019m so sorry."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I can\u2019t tell you that. But perhaps the killer dropped a fun and imaginative clue somewhere in the apartment."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Whoa I\u2019m calling my dad okay? He\u2019s got experience dealing with pregnant ladies because he\u2019s an OBGYN. And experience with crazy ladies because of my mom."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Why do you need all this stuff?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon\u2019s Kryptonite."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yes we win again."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Why are you making this so difficult?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"It\u2019s okay Leonard "},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wait. Excuse me. You forgot my barbecue bacon cheeseburger barbecue sauce bacon and cheese on the side."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Have fun."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"After you wrap the body in reflective tape the ends get Teflon tape so we can get a tight seal."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It wasn\u2019t my fault. I had never seen my brother\u2019s project. And my mother could\u2019ve told me before instead of at the ceremony in front of everyone."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Now that Howard\u2019s getting married maybe he\u2019ll inflate one of his old girlfriends for you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"We were; it\u2019s just it\u2019s not fair okay? They\u2019re bad people. It\u2019s not supposed to end happy for them it\u2019s supposed to end happy for me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"If Penny didn\u2019t know that Lesley had already turned me down then that would unambiguously mean that she Penny thought that I should her Lesley out indicating that she Penny had no interest in me asking her Penny out. But because she did know that I had asked Lesley out and that she Lesley had turned me down then she Penny could be offering consolation. That\u2019s too bad you would have made a cute couple. But while thinking good Leonard remains available."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh beefaroni. I think I\u2019ll miss you most of all."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wo de ming zi shi Sheldon. "},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Ooh big talk from a man who was once treed by a chicken."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"This insistence on hand-holding is preposterous."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You know this reminds me of high school."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Fine what do you want me to do?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"If you have time to lean you have time to clean."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh why can\u2019t I stay mad at you?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh looking through my textbooks for a new field of inquiry. Why do we have a geology book? Leonard did you throw a children\u2019s party while I was in Texas?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Basketball Pope."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"People."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I just keep thinking about how cool it would be if I called my mom and told her that I got tenure at Caltech."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I know."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh simple the \u2018arrah \u2018arrah in the riddle mean Jan Arrah a member of the Legion of Superheroes known as Element Lad. And then the word He it wasn\u2019t the masculine pronoun but rather H e the abbreviation for helium. See where I\u2019m going with this?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I told you. That was a different guy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well get ready to stroll down memory lane. Penny your check engine\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I wonder if this is what it feels like to be Bernadette\u2019s baby."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh another market to expand into balding gay men."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"There you go."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What are you talking about?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Zack this is my friend Claire."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Huh. Okay. As long as it doesn\u2019t end with us having coitus with him I\u2019m in."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Excuse me? Isn\u2019t this the point where the world-weary barkeep absentmindedly wipes down the bar and coaxes the woes out of the troubled patron?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Uh I\u2019m going to draw you a soothing bath. Where\u2019s your bath thermometer?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"All of them."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So you guys were testing us both? What is the matter with you?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Very well a quick opening statement. Like a milking stool my case rests on three legs. I will demonstrate that I was improperly instructed in driving by a woman whose lack of respect for society borders on the sociopathic. I will argue that the emergency met the legal doctrine of quod est necessarium est licitum that which is necessary is legal. But first I will raise a Sixth Amendment issue. I\u2019m unable to confront my accuser a non-human entity to wit a camera. So to sum up improper instruction quod est necessarium est licitum Sixth Amendment. My milk stool is complete."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Run down the pros and cons of each for me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That\u2019s great but I\u2026."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"So tell me about your scalar dark energy experiment."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Of course not."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Do you realize what this means? All I need is a healthy ovum and I can grow my own Leonard Nimoy!"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Are you sure? That doesn\u2019t sound right."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"This should be fairly easy to deduce. He\u2019s holding the phone to his left ear. Ears do not cross hemispheres so he\u2019s using the analytical rather than the emotional side of the brain suggesting that he has no personal relationship with the caller."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh what did those rascals do now?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah. It must be nice to have someone do something so romantic."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah. And there\u2019s your money back and now we\u2019re even. How great is that?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"So you\u2019re saying that friendship contains within it an inherent obligation to maintain confidences?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Uh would you like to come in?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"And I support you."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"So she\u2019s gonna be laid up for at least six weeks."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.  Okay."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"More."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I can\u2019t believe you kept this."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Damn I need my inhaler."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Not at all. Frequent coitus dramatically increases the odds of fertiliziation."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019ve gotten a lot more street since we broke up."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Ooh I have an idea. Since it\u2019s not happening any time soon why don\u2019t your character and your character do it in the game?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh no it\u2019s all right. I think of my time with Amy as a stick of Fruit Stripe gum. Sweet and enjoyable at first but ultimately a flavourless lump of sadness."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No I do. Eventually you\u2019ll want more space and you\u2019ll move into a house and then instead of dinner a couple of times a week it\u2019ll only be a couple of times a month and then it\u2019ll only be on special occasions like when Bernadette divorces Wolowitz. Or or or like when Koothrappali\u2019s weird girlfriend admits where she buried his body. Or Amy\u2019s wedding where she\u2019s marrying someone better than me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Marry you?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes. You\u2019re my ride."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yes okay but I\u2019m gonna be gone for three months. What if she doesn\u2019t miss me that long and she meets someone else?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah yeah yeah very perky."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh! Bernadette you look beautiful!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019ll eat later. Right now I\u2019m suckling at the informative bosom of mother physics."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Really?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah I have a lactose intolerant roommate with a taste for ice cream. Next."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Sorry. You\u2019re right. I\u2019m so stressed. But you know what whenever I walk into that temple I realize that whatever happens it\u2019s okay. We\u2019re all part of an immense pattern and though we can\u2019t understand it we can be happy to know that it\u2019s it\u2019s working its will through us."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay well they sure as hell don\u2019t say that."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Now take a sip swirl it around your mouth and try to notice the flavours the tannins the textures. Well?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Draft. You see people hear the word year and they think duration. Foot pound has the same problem that\u2019s a unit of work not of weight."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah today Amy and I are deciding what we\u2019re all gonna do."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What did I do?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah sure. He really worked with the Drug Enforcement Agency?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yeah?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Sadly Penny this evening I am the Dark Knight roaming these mean streets alone. A windbreaker for my cape and a stern expression for my cowl."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Come on Sheldon say something."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay. Have fun."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh. Yeah okay."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Dude she said she wants to slow things down."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well seeing as its purpose was to piss you off I\u2019d say it\u2019s spot-on."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No it hurt\u2026  Great Caesar\u2019s Ghost look at this place?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You\u2019re welcome."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Fine. "},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m about to lose control and I think I like it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m sorry."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re so close."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Mm just down there."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re right. If someone wants to get at Missy\u2019s fallopian tubes they\u2019ll have to go through me."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Why? So you can make jokes about cutting open my brain?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey. What\u2019re you working on?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Excuse me in what universe are Slurpies Icees?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I\u2019ll tell you one thing. If I get rich enough that\u2019s the kind of girl I want to take on a submarine ride. And yes that time I meant it to be dirty."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No it\u2019s not."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Uh not that I know of. Hey while we\u2019re on the subject why did you guys break up anyway?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well I suppose turnabout is fair play."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"That makes even less sense I mean\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah we\u2019ll pick a date when we pick a date."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Shotgun."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"How many times do I have to say I\u2019m sorry?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah sure I guess."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Honestly we\u2019ve been operating under the assumption that he has no deal."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"All right. Thank you. I\u2019m sorry too."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh uh let me try. Uh channelis changeroni. This might be my second favorite brown magic wand."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hey guys guess who I found at LAX. My baby sister Priya."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Where are we going?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What\u2019s the matter."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh is Cinnamon gonna be okay?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Subtlety isn\u2019t her strong suit is it?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh dear lord Penny\u2019s pregnant too?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Penny how\u2019s it going over there?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"All right Sheldon this craziness has gone on long enough.

The only improvement you were able to make on the robot was to put fresh batteries in the remote."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I got it I got it. Listen um I think there\u2019s been a misunderstanding. See Penny is my fianc\u00e9e."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019ll be damned."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Ah no problem. It wouldn\u2019t be Thanksgiving without an Indian providing the food. Uh now where does your mom keep the Crisco?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Although Amy and I did just move in together and a plant is a lovely housewarming gift."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah it turns out someone added simulated signals to the data files. They faked the results."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Then again he did think you were my husband."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Simple extrapolation. In the three years that I\u2019ve known you you were single for two. During that time I saw 17 different suitors. If we work backwards correcting for observation bias and postulate an initial dating age of 15\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No no wait hold on."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"No I won\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What? Oh okay uh okay yeah no problem just come up here and help me pull and turn."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Everybody?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You\u2019re kidding.

This is our idea based on our research. How can you possibly justify owning a majority share?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What\u2019s the matter?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay good \u2019cause I wasn\u2019t really gonna go."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Really?

First we had to iron out a few details. "},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Two words 3-D printer. Wait maybe it\u2019s three words. No hang on. Okay one word a letter and a number and maybe a hyphen. 3-D printer."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Wow. You know the last time I saw my grandma the most exciting thing was watching the ash of her cigarette get longer and wondering if it was gonna fall in her pudding."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019m taking you home."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"And we\u2019ve built it up in our heads so much."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Leonard?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It\u2019s nice of you to let him keep staying at your mom\u2019s house."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I didn\u2019t break it. I I guess Stuart sold it to me like this."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Good black is more slimming. Oh that\u2019s her. I got to go be butch. Toodles. Hey."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Look even when Penny and I started living together there was a learning curve. But I promise you it does get easier."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What\u2019s up?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Not a lot. Just that we always have the option of going back to being friends."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey you coming to lunch?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey.

Why does that seem to flabbergast everybody?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I am. Are you interested in physics?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"That is one tough birdie."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Good choice. Critical hit. Your sword goes through its eye into its tiny brain. With its final dying gasp it says you have reduced me to a pile of sushi. Enjoy me with this packet of soy sauce. It\u2019s low sodium. Aaaah."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I apologize that it\u2019s so warm in here."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I wonder what the non-pathetic people are doing tonight."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"There\u2019s a reciprocity clause. You get to pull the plug on him too."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No. What happened?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hey look now maybe you have democracy now in your beloved Russia but on this physics bowl team I rule with an iron fist. .

He got it at the mall on clearance. Now move move move."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"This is an interesting way to stay out of it."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well I\u2019ve always had this fantasy that involves dancing. The sexual chemistry between my partner and me is electric. But boy oh boy does my father not approve until he sees us in the big dance competition."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hey look there\u2019s Rothman\u2019s empty office.

Are you still out there?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"This is ridiculous. I\u2019m a grown man from Texas. This isn\u2019t a terrifying bird like a swan or a goose. It\u2019s just a blue jay.  No!"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Sure. We\u2019ve both been in his shoes. We\u2019ll let him down with compassion and respect."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It\u2019s bigger than the house my grandfather grew up in."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah maybe."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No. Steve Patterson told me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s magnificent. This is going to be the best Valentine\u2019s Day ever."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Must you?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Penny proposed and I didn\u2019t say yes."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So tenured means a job for life?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Not that I can think of."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No you\u2019ve got a Reebok with a gunshot wound and an ouchie on your pinkie toe."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"When you live with someone there\u2019s gonna be conflict.

What happened?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Sheldon get over here and help."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay I know you don\u2019t want to talk about it but can I just ask you one question about your mom\u2019s book?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Of course. I know what it\u2019s like having to go through a loved one\u2019s possessions. My uncle was a worshipper of Krishna. But after he died you know what we found? A statue of Shiva. It may not be Crips and Bloods okay? But in India it\u2019s a thing."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Aw. Embarrassed you?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hide me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh that is not true."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I think it\u2019s lovely you call your mommy and let her know you\u2019re going to be late for dinner. From what I know about these things if a woman doesn\u2019t breast-feed on time it\u2019s very uncomfortable for her boobies."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay just hang on."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh come on. I don\u2019t want to sit by myself."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"And that\u2019s how a girl makes a scene. I\u2019m sorry sweetie. You\u2019re right. You deserve your weekend. Come on Amy let\u2019s go."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t know maybe that you\u2019d be a little upset and then you\u2019d realize that I\u2019m a stallion that has to run free.

Look we\u2019ve put this off long enough. Let\u2019s do it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"And it helps to have small delicate fingers. So don\u2019t be discouraged if you can\u2019t do it as fast as me and Howard."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I\u2019m cute. I get by."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Why aren\u2019t you talking to me?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You own the damn thing.

That was a magical experience."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh that seems overly harsh. I mean you gave in to a human weakness you didn\u2019t kill a man.

I wanted a griffin."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I can\u2019t believe she would say that about me."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh can I show her an oil painting I made of us surrounded by our children and grandchildren?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay I\u2019m an actress. Ask me again."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Ooh Emily. I heard him say that to Emily.

You\u2019re gonna make out so hard tonight."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Got it. Now uh I have a question about the song. I was thinking at some point I could bust out a little rap."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You may have a point. I love my mother. Even if she fornicates like a demonic weasel."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah which he rudely announced on my flag show. People were so upset about it no one else called in the rest of the night."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Fish nightlights."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well he\u2019s even more cunning than we thought."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Really? What was your first clue?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Social niceties have been suspended Leonard. We\u2019re in a state of a emergency. The world has descended into darkened turmoil. Lawlessness and savagery are the order of the day."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well it\u2019s a lot better than having to wear noise-cancelling headphones in my own apartment."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"How would I be blinded?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Interesting. Very interesting."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh my God."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay bye-bye."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No. Once these puppies touch the ground they\u2019re mine and I\u2019ll have to wear them walking up and down Hollywood Boulevard in order to pay them off. Pretty pretty pretty."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You slipped and fell into a robot hand?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Come on Sheldon it\u2019ll be fun."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah you can\u2019t stay in your apartment for the rest of your life."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I believe the condensation on your frozen foods weakened the structural integrity of the bag. But returning to your key conundrum perhaps you should call a locksmith and have him open the door for you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh yummy yummy! We should do this more often. Uh-oh."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yes. Look up at the sign and remember improv is always about saying yes."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right this goes against everything I stand for but desperate times call for desperate measures. Lord this is Sheldon Cooper. You\u2019re good friends with my mom. I know I\u2019ve spent my life denying that you exist."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay. Well how about this? Kidnap Bernadette from the opera wearing a creepy mask so she doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"The whole point of a secret knock is to establish a non-verbal signal to verify the identity of one\u2019s co-conspirators."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Uh excuse me Mrs. Davis?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hi."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Not to worry. I hid it. Bazinga! You\u2019re in my spot."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"250 million years."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"But uh before I take my shirt off I just need like ten minutes to do some crunches."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Amazing an intelligent labradoodle."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard disproved my element. Now all the attention is going to go away."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Can\u2019t help a friend out in a time of need huh? I see where your therapist was coming from."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Thanks. I love hockey."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"The only flaw in an otherwise perfect plan. Now get my back Jack."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You\u2019re a sucky friend you know that? A sucky sucky friend."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Should we take this little party to the bedroom?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Thanks."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Heated to precisely 183 degrees?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Very well. Count the first on or about the 28th day of April the accused did knowingly and with malice aforethought deny access to the shared bathroom in a time of emergency to wit my back teeth were floating. Count the second the accused exceeded the agreed upon occupancy of the shower to wit one unless we are under attack by water-soluble aliens."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah Amy told me what happened. Look just apologize. It\u2019ll warm her twaddle."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well maybe that\u2019s what I was going for."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh hey Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No. I need to get you down for a nap. And for some reason that VapoRub gets you all fired up. "},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Howard has announced his intention to propose marriage to Bernadette."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I also now have three points on a driver\u2019s licence I do not yet possess and I was forced to issue an undeserved apology simply because I refuse to urinate in a stainless steel bowl in front of criminals."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Brawny?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Alright alright well just sit down yes sit down now close your eyes."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And here\u2019s another interesting weather fact."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Um can I have your attention everyone?  That\u2019s uh B-flat for those who don\u2019t have perfect pitch. I would like to propose a toast to my best friend Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. He has been presented with a wonderful opportunity and I couldn\u2019t be happier for him."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay. I know. It was me. I I pushed too hard. I\u2019m sorry."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay. Well bye. "},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Fine? You said it was fine?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Feel is a kind of a\u2026 it\u2019s a strong word. Um I just think it would be a nice gesture on your part."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Is it a secret bank account? Because that would be awesome."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh yeah right. Lock up your daughters or Sheldon might lecture them about the North American Free Trade Agreement."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"How so?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Amy has a fondness for the comic strip Marmaduke."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Come on trust me he\u2019s hitting on you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No no not at all. A little bit."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well what do you want to write?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Why? Do you not want me to go?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Thank you Penny. You know I just need to keep reminding myself that Bert\u2019s success is not my failure."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard no sleep while I play bongos. Bongo solo."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Like when?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh your buddy got mugged by some baby farm animals."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Didn\u2019t you say you\u2019re making hydrogen sulphide gas?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Excuse me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Are you kidding me? I already have two strikes."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It\u2019s just that they\u2019ve had plenty of help."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay so while we were going out how often would you pretend to like things just to have sex with me?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wowza."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Do they know it\u2019s there? I mean should I tell somebody?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh hello. What can I do for you ladies?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh I really don\u2019t care anymore"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It\u2019s got a big bird on it dude."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Nope got to go with Amy on this one."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah so is Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No but I\u2019m also closer to the entrance in case of attack."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey all set. What do you think? There\u2019s plenty of room for everybody a view out the window."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh no."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Why not?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You didn\u2019t do anything. It\u2019s Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re right. I\u2019m smart as a whip. I should be able to figure this out."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Haven\u2019t you been listening to me I cannot talk to women."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Use the force Sheldon. Use the force.  I\u2019m gonna need more force."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Is there any part of your body that\u2019s normal?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Mmm."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well it turns out she really knows how to help a guy loosen up and have a good time. Although truth be told my groin\u2019s a little worse for wear.  Ow! Why did you do that?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No no. I\u2019ll finish making the tea while you narcissistically ramble on about whatever\u2019s troubling you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Now we\u2019re getting somewhere."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You know checking e-mail updating my facebook status messing up wikipedia entries. Hey did you know Netflix lets you stream movies on your computer now?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh you did didn\u2019t you?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You think?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh oh gee my initial reaction is no. You know let me think about it and get back to you okay?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t believe it matters what the topic is. What\u2019s crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way. It\u2019s all about the execution."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m telling you you got this."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Why?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You\u2019re right. I\u2019m sorry. We have the rest of our lives to dredge stuff up from the past and fight about it. So what do you think? Should we run next door and grab a bite?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You! Always bet on black."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Uh well it\u2019s just that the physicists I know are indoorsy and pale."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Where would you go?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I feel like I know what song that is but I can\u2019t put my finger on it.  My country \u2019tis of thee. No."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"A total loser. Obviously a guy with a six-shooter beats an old man with a magic wand."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh well you know that is interesting. I wonder what kind of infection you\u2019ll come home with. My money\u2019s on fungal. They\u2019re still having girls night across the hall."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah it\u2019s a perfectly good word. You put it in front of wine or dining and you\u2019ve really got something. Okay well let me ask you this how was last night for you?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It isn\u2019t Meemaw. Sorry Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Really? How many grown-ups do you know who have Mr. Spock oven mitts? Hey the recipes are on my iPad. Will you pull \u2019em up?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to stop thinking about it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right you have to get out of the car right now. I\u2019m not going to jail for you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Really? What do we tell Siebert?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Since we come in every Tuesday night at six o\u2019clock and order the same exact thing and it\u2019s now six oh eight I believe your question not only answers itself but also stands alongside such other nonsensical queries as who let the dogs out? and uh How are they hanging?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah you\u2019d think that but after a while it starts showing up in your dreams."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Has your uh assistant said anything about me?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay this isn\u2019t at all good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who\u2019s just respawned you need to give them a chance to  now come on!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019d be swell if they had a train."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Seven years ago I found out the DVD was late and I paid for it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I don\u2019t care about Alex. Fine I care. Okay I hate that bitch. But what really hurt is that you liked it so much. I mean do I need to be worried?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Did you have fun? Because if you had fun then you are you are a winner. Now that\u2019s that-that\u2019s what chess is all about."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay Amy you\u2019re being silly. I am not concerned about who hangs out with who. And I certainly don\u2019t have a problem with Leonard\u2019s new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup. Ooh these are cute. Of course if I buy them I\u2019ll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well you barely looked. Let me see."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh dear!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m going to get some fries. You want anything?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah. It\u2019s okay I guess."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"It\u2019s just one history class. Look I didn\u2019t finish college so I thought I would give it a try."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"How many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay this was helpful."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Unbelievable."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I told you they\u2019ll be right out."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It\u2019s the least I can do for helping me carry my stuff up."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon Sheldon?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"My mother was at bible study. I walked in the house expecting to find it empty and I heard a sound coming from my parents\u2019 bedroom. When I opened the door I saw my father having relations with another woman."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Uh okay well we were just calling you because we were missing you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Right. Archimedes once said give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it and I shall move the world."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You know it. Oo-ah oo-ah."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t need anything at the Galleria. Do you need anything at the Galleria?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"366\u2026 367\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"They\u2019re not going anywhere.  So you\u2019re coming home from work. That\u2019s great. How was work."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Spaghetti okay?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Shuddup yeah you do."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Don\u2019t be ridiculous. I have no peers."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah bitches are the worst."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Careful you\u2019re using too much Downey. You know if my clothes get too soft it makes me sleepy."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What about the guy over there in the superhero T-shirt tucked into his sweatpants?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So don\u2019t watch TV. Read a book."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh this is the best. You have booze with breakfast on a Tuesday you got a problem. You do it on the weekend you got brunch."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Mmm."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah right here. How was Nebraska?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh-huh."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh my God why did you eat it?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Uh what do you say we exchange gifts?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Please try to wear something appropriate. It won\u2019t help my case if the judge is busy trying to read the word Juicy scrawled across your buttocks."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Did you really have to bring it in with you?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s the only explanation I can come up with for why you think you sell shoes and yogurt."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I give you one simple thing to do contact a complete stranger and make her fall in love with me and you blow it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"She said no can we drop it now?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh we need to kill a couple hours till the next showing of Time Bandits."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard in the world of theoretical physics you never finish. So much is unprovable. But when I was studying that railway guide it was so tangible and so satisfying that something just clicked. Then it clacked. Then it clicked then it clacked click-clack clickety-clack and here we are. Whoo-whoo."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well what about this helicopter you control with an iPad?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Nobody does. I was embarrassed so I didn\u2019t say anything."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Howard help me out here."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":" Penny."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Do you need it to buy a less disturbing sweater-vest?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh I see. How about now?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right let\u2019s get right to the vote. Show of hands all those opposed to Leonard and his reign of tyranny."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Whoa whoa! Now you\u2019re making fun of my bona fides?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Except you identified me your best friend as a gangrenous limb that needed to be severed from the organism and tossed away. The desperate act of a little man with a big Napoleon complex."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Wow. High-techie-techie. What\u2019s this little box?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Just guys. Anyway when I told him we split up he was heartbroken and he kept bugging me how\u2019s Leonard? why can\u2019t you get back together with Leonard? I bet Leonard never tipped a cow over on himself. So to get him off my back I told him we worked things out."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh my God this is the best cobbler I\u2019ve ever had."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hint Madame Curie had her husband to help her."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Anyway thanks again."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What is it about the word unique you don\u2019t understand?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey you already got a girlfriend. I call dibs."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Thank you I really appreciate this."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So Penny doesn\u2019t want me around her friends I embarrass her. What else could it be?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m trying not to attract attention."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"That\u2019s Unbreakable by Khloe and Lamar. And for your information it\u2019s unisex."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Where are you going?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leslie Winkle?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I broke down and I read Lucy\u2019s blog and in one of the entries she said when we first met I struck her as a little feminine."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t think so."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"For example tonight no-one needs to know that my middle name is Leakey."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019ll get them."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s not bad. Unless you compare it to a train; then it stinks."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"W-wait!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Superman\u2019s gone my stormtrooper\u2019s gone."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What\u2019s the gist physicist?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yeah the theme will be that the greatest love a man can have is the love he has with himself."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Very well. I know you\u2019ve been seeing other men. Have you had coitus with any of them?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"In that case may I offer 27 little tweaks to make it slightly less embarrassing?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I know. I was looking forward to it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Again it was miniature golf."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh uh Priya\u2019s calling in a few minutes on Skype and we are gonna have a dinner date."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I have a couple more quick questions. Do you want to call me from the car?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I do but for some reason Emily loves it and wants to watch it with me tomorrow so I thought if I start with you first then I could act cool about it with her."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Who\u2019s the bobblehead of?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I hadn\u2019t considered that. Give me a moment. All right I\u2019ve considered it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Whenever I saw her she\u2019d say I was too skinny and try and feed me."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"That\u2019s a fair point. We wouldn\u2019t make fun of someone like this to their face."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You know I have ten fingers and ten toes. If I tell you a story about each one of them we\u2019ll be here all day let\u2019s just move on."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well I believe people do their best work when they feel safe and secure."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No I\u2019m not happy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh but then we\u2019d have to baby-proof the apartment.

Oh look at you. You you look like you grew."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hi."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Excuse me. May I have your attention please? I have recently been made aware that my personal relationship with Amy Farrah Fowler has become water cooler gossip. And I just want to say shame on all of you. We\u2019re scientists. Our minds should be focused on the advancement of human knowledge not the intimate details of other people\u2019s lives."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Have you noticed it\u2019s always an A-flat?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Thank you so much for letting me practice my sales pitch on you. I really appreciate it."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"The kite you made me lose was an authentic Patang an Indian fighting kite that my brother sent to me from New Delhi.

What are you gonna do?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You violated the sanctity of my mouth."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Thank you. Ira if I may I\u2019d like to apologize for my behaviour last week."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Uh sweetie are you all right?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"My point is while you\u2019re spending all this time on your own building computers or practicing your cello what you\u2019re really doing is becoming interesting. And when people finally do notice you they\u2019re gonna find someone a lot cooler than they thought. And for those of you who were popular in high school it\u2019s over sorry.

Would you prefer to wait in our apartment?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Because I knew you\u2019d screw this up."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"No. You have to read it how Dr. Angus McDougal of the University of Edinburgh would.

A lot of words sound like yoga."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"If we were an old married couple the wife would serve iced tea and snickerdoodles."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I did but I think I\u2019ve kind of outgrown Star Trek.

Perfect they can be electrons."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"While you watch me do it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah well I understand that I\u2019m half naked but there is a reasonable explanation. While I slept in my sleeper car all my possessions were stolen. Now typically I wear pyjamas but I recently adopted a hobo lifestyle and pyjamas are the sleep-pants of the Man. I\u2019ll have you know Mahatma Gandhi wore no pants and a nation rallied behind him. My good man now before you walk away I know that I may appear deranged but I am in fact a world-renowned physicist. Ask me the difference between a boson and a fermion. Go ahead ask.

I\u2019m thinking Howard wasn\u2019t making a back-scratching metaphor. I\u2019m thinking there was some actual scratching involved."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"He still hasn\u2019t responded. What\u2019s taking him so long?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah they have to I\u2019m a biter."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey Stuart!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Not in these pants."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"For a man so good at predicting my moves how come you stink at 3-D chess?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"We\u2019ll take some Funyuns."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You think they came up with that? They were going to drink beer and play darts."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"My Mr Spock doll came to me in a dream and forced me to open it. And when the toy broke I switched it for yours.

I\u2019d love to chat but there\u2019s a line that could start moving any minute so let\u2019s do this. Amy? A proper apology requires three steps. Step one an admission of wrongdoing. Amy I was wrong. Step two a promise never to repeat said action. Amy that action will never be repeated and that\u2019s a promise. Step three an earnest request for forgiveness. Amy I hope you can forgive me. And I hope you do it right now \u2019cause there\u2019s an Uber waiting downstairs and I don\u2019t want to repeat this apology nonsense with my driver Ganesh."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So am I driving you to work or are you still mad at me?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Then what?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh we didn\u2019t screw around.

Nothing makes beer taste better than cool clear Rocky Mountain spring water. Where are the Rocky Mountains anyway?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"We were all thinking it really. It was kind of the elephant in the room so\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey. Want to join us?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Wow. How\u2019s that Hater-Ade taste bro? Hey this isn\u2019t the way to work."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"That\u2019s a mirror."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Uh we don\u2019t discuss anything. Leonard is the signatory to the Roommate Agreement. As such he bears responsibility for all your infractions and must pay all fines."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Wait Sheldon gave me a banana in a box. He was testing me too."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"No. I took her for coffee and she snuck out the bathroom window to get away from me."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yes please.  You\u2019ll never guess who they got to replace you at work\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"If you could feel how soft my skin is you wouldn\u2019t have to ask."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well you get bit by a radioactive animal in a lab you kind of want to turn into a superhero."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Five million three hundred eighteen thousand and eight?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What are you doing?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Mom what an unexpected pleasure."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"So I was thinking maybe we can come up with a name for the asteroid by combining our names."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Dr. Jeffries hello again. Leonard Hofstadter."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I agree. Sheldon\u2019s sister is hiding at Penny\u2019s because we\u2019ve all been hitting on her at the same time."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I assumed you would."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Aw.

Can\u2019t you let me have my moment?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Woo-hoo!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Plus there\u2019s almost no chance we\u2019ll see any of our coworkers half naked."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"He wasn\u2019t in a car but okay."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Amy don\u2019t be like that."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Problem?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Wait who\u2019s Tor?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Two."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Pchew!"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Who died and made you king of moments?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well I just think that maybe you\u2019re a little hung up on the money because I\u2019m less reliant on you now and that\u2019s a little scary."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What about me?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh my God you are amazing. I mean I don\u2019t deserve you. Wh what do what do you mean everybody?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What are you talking about?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"In fact it\u2019s better if you don\u2019t otherwise it makes the rest of us look bad."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"We hope. The signal has to travel over three billion miles. So it\u2019s gonna be hours before we know if it even survived."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"He doesn\u2019t really want Penny to go to Comic-Con. He\u2019s just doing it to make her happy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Blue as in depressed."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes I want you to apologize to Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah. Hang on. Sheldon!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m glad you agree. I hired some guys to help us move it come on in fellas.

And neither do you."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Wait. Can you at least tell me what went wrong? It\u2019s okay. I can take anything.

We\u2019re across the hall."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And look how irritable it\u2019s making you!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Not as relieved as I\u2019m about to be. It\u2019s a brave new world little lady."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Then who is?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Right. Still mad at me about that?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What\u2019s this cartoon called again?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Sounds like a lot of work."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No I didn\u2019t try I succeeded. In fact I was briefly able to see the inside of my sister\u2019s guinea pig Snowball before he caught fire. It led to an interesting expression in our house not a snowball\u2019s chance in a cat scanner."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I would\u2019ve preferred to have you there with me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Of course I am. Removing Joe Chill as the killer of Batman\u2019s parents effectively deprived him of his raison d\u2019\u00eatre."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"A common spare. The Miss Congeniality of the bowling pageant. Before you jump on Twitter to tout your modest accomplishment watch how it\u2019s really done. I am the ball. My thoughts are its thoughts.

It features Whoopi Goldberg. She played Guinan on Star Trek Next Gen. Penny Next Gen refers to Star Trek\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey I just wanted to bring you a little housewarming gift."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well I did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast which could give a positive urine test for opiates but certainly not dilate my pupils so I guess there\u2019s no point in bringing it up."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s important."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Am I? Yesterday I had an Air Force project a girlfriend who lived with me and my good friend Raj right across the hall."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You know who\u2019s got to be the bravest person in the Marvel Universe? Whoever has to give She-Hulk a bikini wax."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I will see you gentlemen later."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Then I\u2019ll look from the door of my heavenly home and pity the miner that mines my poor bones."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes. Oh I\u2019m so excited. And I just can\u2019t hide it."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Not even to sleep?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sorry buddy."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Really? You love them?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah you all do. Anyway I feel like he\u2019s hitting on her.

But now he\u2019s happy to let people think he\u2019s responsible for everything."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Fine. Okay. Now on this side I am closer to the exit in case of emergency."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hello. How\u2019s the final stage of your nicotine addiction study going?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Maybe you could run some computer simulations."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I am not a know-it-all. I\u2019m a person who knows lots of things and likes to correct other people when they\u2019re wrong."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well if it\u2019s of any help I\u2019ve read all the great moral philosophers including Dr. Seuss."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I asked."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Nothing? It sounds like you got caught speeding going 4000 miles an hour."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hi."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Why don\u2019t you give it a try Sheldon?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"There\u2019s no hurry Mother tell them more about their secret love for each other."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"How? You had the whole floor to yourself."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I found him. He\u2019s in the bathroom. President Siebert?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m not surprised."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey Sheldon I\u2019ve got someone here who might make you feel better."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hello Penny. I realize you\u2019re currently at the mercy of your primitive biological urges but as you have an entire lifetime of poor decisions ahead of you may I interrupt this one?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What are you saying? We\u2019re not coordinated enough to play sports?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes yes. Yeah I\u2019m definitely going with colonoscopy."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What do you want."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh sure sure yeah. Very Christmassy."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Ordinary yet I sense it is dripping with magical potential."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh no. I hope everything\u2019s okay."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Never mind. I still can\u2019t tell you."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Cocktain shrimp are $12.50."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So is that one mine."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"They\u2019re bigger than mine."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Happy Valentine\u2019s Day."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay but the Jennifer Aniston movie has Jennifer Aniston and she\u2019s not building a dam."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Shall we toast?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay. Amy\u2019s decided she wants to move in with me so I need you to come back home you lovable scamp. That\u2019s a lot of product."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah just leave me out of it. You know if they come here and see crap everywhere they\u2019re just gonna blame the Indian guy."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh okay. Well I was hoping um you could do me a favour."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yes I was there."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh good.

Crap."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Do you think a sexually ambivalent Indian astrophysicist with selective mutism and alcohol issues is better than a hundred-pound Jewish guy who lives with his mom?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Fine. You\u2019re in Sheldon Square."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Is that all you have? Shopworn tidbits like talk to her and let it go? Gee Penny life\u2019s giving me lemons. What should I do?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Go ahead."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Excuse me. This changes nothing. Except the Halloween costume I\u2019m wearing this year. Amy you\u2019re going to be Olive Oyl. Lay off the doughnuts."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Damn it he\u2019s good at that too."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Ooh look an Indiana Jones connect-the-dots."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh that wasn\u2019t clear. Try it again but this time drive it home with how do you like them apples Missy?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Then we\u2019re probably okay."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well sure."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Subtle."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Leonard if you\u2019re mad about this just tell me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"But if you\u2019re ever short there\u2019s always a couple of fifties in Green Lantern\u2019s ass."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What you wouldn\u2019t trust him?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Or in German a Besserwisser."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Booting."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Just tell me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh a scroll. I like scrolls. They\u2019re my third favourite system of transmitting the written word. After stone tablets and skywriting. You have all been summoned to join a thrilling Dungeons and Dragons adventure. Your quest begins in a secret northern village of elves who have all been massacred. I like where this is heading. Your task is to rescue their leader from a dungeon of ogres. Oh that\u2019s a saucy twist. That leader\u2019s name Santa Claus. No no no."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You you\u2019re kidding. That\u2019s fantastic!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Next game let\u2019s switch helmets."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What about her?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"We owe you an apology."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well why don\u2019t you tell her?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No. But it was okay. I mean when I was little I\u2019d think maybe my parents would change their mind and surprise me with a party like this one birthday I came home from my Cello lesson and I saw a lot of strange cars parked out front and when I got to the door I could hear people whispering and I could smell German chocolate cake which is my favourite."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I see. And is that open for discussion?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Who is this Justin?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Bread."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Do you even like the Beach Boys?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What? Is there another twist coming? Is the baby not theirs at all?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Maybe when I publish it I\u2019ll include an inhaler."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay fine like a pinky swear."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Because I didn\u2019t want there to be any secrets between us."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey don\u2019t discourage him. This is a fantastic opportunity."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Look on the bright side she might turn out to be a nice beautiful girl."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Why don\u2019t you ask her to come up?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Are you kidding me?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hey Penny can you give me a hand with this?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"A hotel? Did you see The Shining?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh Sheldon we don\u2019t need a meeting every three months."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Because I don\u2019t need his girlfriend to set me up with one of her girlfriends. I\u2019m perfectly capable of finding a girl on my own."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m not sure. Just feels a little anticlimactic."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hmm. A while back YouTube changed its user interface from a star-based rating system to a thumbs-up rating system. I tell people I\u2019m okay with it but I\u2019m really not."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"In love yet?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"But she\u2019s not my favourite of the X-Men in order that would be Wolverine Cyclops oh wait I forgot Professor X. Professor X Wolverine Cyclops Iceman then Storm Angel the Beast oh wait Nightcrawler. Professor X Nightcrawler Wolverine Cyclops Iceman then Storm Angel\u2026."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"That is so not true."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That you\u2019re having to process your emotional pain without vodka?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You can if you try. Think about it this way if I were Batman and you were Alfred you\u2019d keep that secret. Right?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m gonna go home and take a nap."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sheldon wait this isn\u2019t even what I do. I\u2019m a waitress not a busboy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Of course. She\u2019s spent many nights here and you\u2019re worried about preserving the myth of her virginity before the wedding."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Nice. I got him a sweater."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"That is weird. I thought he was like 45."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh come on we\u2019re all grown-ups. We\u2019ve all done it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Right okay. What was he like when he was young?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Right. Listen to me. We can\u2019t do anything until you do your part. So get up in front of this whiteboard and do it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You don\u2019t how much your rent is?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m sorry.  Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019m in."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Let\u2019s celebrate."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Thank you. "},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Which part?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"How is that building on what he just said?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Leonard just realized that Penny\u2019s been hiding him from her friends because he\u2019s a tiny little man who flies kites."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Movies yes."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I know. When is she going home?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well not so much depressed as lonely."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay we need to stop for a minute."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Stop yelling at me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t know what the protocol is here. Do I stay do I leave? Do I wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sweetie you really thought I\u2019d want to do this?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Like a big old baby."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"The stock boy at Walgreens was frustratingly uninformed on the subject."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Uh it wasn\u2019t anything weird. It was just to see how big they were."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh we could set it up like a scavenger hunt where the last puzzle gives the winner Sheldon\u2019s contact information."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Please all comments and questions should be flag-related."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve been at a party where everyone\u2019s talking about flags and I just couldn\u2019t join in."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well yeah."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh. Okay. Sheldon I I\u2019ve got to ask how did you figure out that it was the geology lab?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Just get in here."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s true. He collected and delivered the ark to the proper authorities for filing."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Who cares? He stole the idea and doesn\u2019t deserve his own joke."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Look do you want to buy me out or not?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Infinite Sheldon?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Wait. Can you at least tell me what went wrong? It\u2019s okay. I can take anything. Unless it\u2019s something I did or said or am. \u2018Cause those are like my buttons."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh you know. the lone star state. Hmm. That should be its Yelp rating."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What can I do? I can\u2019t stop thinking about her."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Is there a reason I had to leave my own apartment?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"At least they talked about you on Letterman. Come on I can drive you wherever you need to go."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay that\u2019s question 20 you have to guess."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"But we won\u2019t bore you with the details."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Of course not. I\u2019m too busy to be sick."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sweetie every night you don\u2019t kill him in his sleep he wins."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"But this isn\u2019t about the jewellery. This is about me having a place where I can open up about my feelings."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I love him but if he\u2019s broken let\u2019s not get a new one."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What if a simulated van rear-ends me?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Anyway I\u2019m among a handful of scientists that have been asked to submit a design proposal for the message and its delivery system."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well why isn\u2019t everyone happy? Your little ray of sunshine is ready to beam again."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh sorry uh carrot chunk."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh yeah me too. Zip it lock it.  Put it in your pocket.

HelloHello Kitty!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Gentlemen the most interesting thing just happened with this spoon."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Are you kidding? That\u2019s what you always do. Think harder."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That doesn\u2019t make any sense.

Didn\u2019t your baby room have a theme?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Excuse me we just went over this. As the quintessential middle child your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hang on. Sheldon is proving that you are single-handedly smarter than everyone else so important that you would rather lose by yourself than win as part of a team."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay well we\u2019ll talk to you guys later. Bye. She said not to come. It\u2019s gonna be a while."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Thank you. It wasn\u2019t easy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Fine. Women huh?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re holding two moderate spell cards a small rock and a potion of Zancor which will be about as much help as an air conditioner on the ice planet Hoth. Your only move is to play the potion lose the skirmish and two moves later the game."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What\u2019s wrong?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Story problem? You oh Amy what a dewy-eyed moon-calf you are. Raiders of the Lost Ark is the love child of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas two of the most gifted filmmakers of our generation. I\u2019ve watched it 36 times except for the snake scene and the face-melting scene which I can only watch when it\u2019s still light out but I defy you to find a story problem. Here\u2019s my jaw drop it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That is not a compromise. A compromise is me driving you everywhere because you refuse to learn how."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah yeah. Uh see here\u2019s the thing after you leave I still have to live with him."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That\u2019s not an email that\u2019s Leslie\u2019s facebook page."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"All right. Hang on."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What do you want to do?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Thanks.

So uh listen it was great to see you again. And  and and thanks for the apology."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey. What are you doing here?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well now that you point it out\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Look Penny you\u2019re great but I had a long talk with my parents and they said if I date an Indian girl I get a Maserati."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh for God\u2019s sake. Look he\u2019s a physicist who\u2019s trying to figure out what his next field of study should be."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Come on Sheldon. Amy\u2019s only gone for a few months. And now that I\u2019m moving out your old room is empty so you can stay there whenever you want."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It would seem Amy is drunk in a liquor store parking lot."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh I don\u2019t know.

What do you want for it?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh so you believe your friend and your friend\u2019s wife and your own eyes over me? Wow."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Then I suppose you could have agreed to go."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh this isn\u2019t for Leonard no. Amy bought it for me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Does that step include chloroform and a roll of duct tape?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yes I do. The only reason I went is because you wanted to see them and I wanted to have sex. To this day I can\u2019t see a Sandra Bullock movie poster without getting both bored and aroused."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hey what\u2019s up?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hey.

Charlie\u2019s Angels."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh this heat is brutal."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Peer review? It\u2019s People magazine. People picked me."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Maybe we should see how he\u2019s doing."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"For shame Leonard. For shame. And to think I was ready to waste the last of my good haemorrhoid cream on you."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh well then I can actually feel the moisture going into my skin."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I talk with my eyes."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You insulted my woman. I\u2019m here to defend her honour. Two! It was two.  Wil Wheaton! Now prepare yourself for what may come."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t have a problem with your driving."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Do you think this is cool?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Uh that\u2019s so silly."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Sheldon doesn\u2019t get along with Sheldon. It\u2019s still no reason for me to have to listen to you arm your photon torpedoes every night."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I know I\u2019m familiar with you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hmm."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay. If you can\u2019t get me to stop eating your food what makes you think you can get me to stop using your Wi-Fi?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s preposterous. I do not resemble C3PO. Don\u2019t get me wrong I\u2019m flattered I just don\u2019t see it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No one asked you Uhura."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I know that\u2019s why I shortened it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You bumped the table and you know it."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"They don\u2019t call me Brown Dynamite for nothing."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You were in my\u2026 why would you\u2026 what are you saying?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sorry!

Toy Story?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I\u2019ll tell you where it\u2019s coming from. All you do is make fun of me for coming to girls\u2019 night and now you\u2019re here ruining it for everyone."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I don\u2019t know check your body for tattoos?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yeah yeah. Sure. What\u2019s up?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hurry up find him find him."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I\u2019m not finishing your sentence. You pulled the plug on my funk."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Will you please play the game? I can\u2019t spy with my little eye something passing right through us."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah you\u2019ve been going out for years. You haven\u2019t even slept together."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Can I get any of those with little frankfurter slices and home made croutons?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No I was talking to the bird."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay. I\u2019m sorry I gave you such a hard time I just had to be sure."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well no-one\u2019s going to run a DNA test on it Leonard honestly you over-think everything."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah but you were just sleeping because I forboded you to have sex."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay okay. Uh the analogy between space-time and a supercooled fluid is either meaningless or false. I wish this blog would devote itself to real science instead of wasting our time with crackpot wannabe theoreticians in a rush to publish."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Jealousy? What do I have to be jealous of?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yeah that\u2019s true. In fact they liked the song so much they retooled the whole script around it."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well I\u2019m very happy for you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All set."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Uh since you\u2019re paying for dinner I\u2019ll let that slide. Open yours."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Just to be clear here you\u2019re asking for my assistance."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Are you kidding? I once paid twenty dollars for Theo Sassler\u2019s signature."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Ooh sounds like that fellow knows what he\u2019s talking about. I\u2019d put on my listening ears if I were you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well you\u2019re my girlfriend and I don\u2019t want you to be upset. Then again Wil Wheaton\u2019s my friend and I don\u2019t want him to be upset. Hmm this is a sticky wicket.  What do you think?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh sure what a wonderful idea. And after that I\u2019ll make up my own rules of oral hygiene. You know instead of flossing I\u2019ll rub pudding on my gums. I\u2019m going to get the number of the SyFy Channel and give them what for."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I\u2019m sorry what?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Brent Spiner what have you done?

I\u2019m gonna need more details."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What are you eating?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well sometimes women don\u2019t care. Sometimes it makes them want a guy even more."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Little ball of fur. Keep rubbing."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Sweet!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No he didn\u2019t. Nothing that\u2019s happening here is being done on purpose. Okay uh forget one-on-one. Let\u2019s try a free throw contest. First person who makes a basket wins the office."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019m on a cloud. Swing me. "},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"But the mission wouldn\u2019t be for at least a year. Isn\u2019t that enough time to get your blood pressure under\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Have you seen him?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hi. Want to do yoga with me?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"God I love you.

And he\u2019s an astrophysicist too?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Better acoustics for your throat singing?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"We had a good run you and I."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well I was feeling bad about how I acted the other night so I made you a little something."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What is the harm if I audition?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Nurse\u2019s office."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"He didn\u2019t date. It was pon farr. His blood boiled with mating lust."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t get it."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It is funny when you think about it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I can\u2019t do this. And for your information Leonard the upper flermin doesn\u2019t grow between my shoulder blades it grows out of the belly button on my neck."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hmm. Lisa\u2019s gonna be disappointed."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah no. But yet here you two are still together. And that\u2019s even after you and I had our crazy naked night."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Wouldn\u2019t you be upset if you saw Amy out with someone else?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"But e-excuse me I have something to say. None of you may realize it but I was very much looking forward to this weekend. It was gonna be like the old days the four of us hanging out playing video games before you guys all got girlfriends. Do you have any idea what it\u2019s like to be the only one without a girlfriend? Even if I get one someday I\u2019ll still be the guy who got a girl after Sheldon Cooper!"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I didn\u2019t even know there was a President\u2019s dining room."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Wow your work on jellyfish neural nets sounds so interesting."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Why don\u2019t you want to get your mother from the airport?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Uh Sheldon I think we\u2019re good for now."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No no. But in this case yes."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I know. You can spend your whole life working and at the end all that\u2019s left are some papers in a box."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"And judging by her lack of Adam\u2019s apple she\u2019s been female her entire life. I like that in a woman."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thank you. I\u2019m a naive idiot right?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What do you think I should do?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Will do."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s just the beginning. I also have an idea for a bulk mail-order feminine hygiene company. Oh glow in the dark tampons! Leonard we\u2019re going to be rich."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Leonard Hofstadter."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey look at me I don\u2019t have a foreskin."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"So I\u2019ve been told. But I can\u2019t understand what she has to complain about. I mean she has a front-row seat as I make scientific history. There\u2019s string cheese in my mini-fridge and that\u2019s for anyone. Yeah and just yesterday I led her away from a life of sexual promiscuity by making her look at pictures of disease-ridden genitalia."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh no I see the confusion. No the intent behind that clause was to force you to take care of me when I\u2019m ill. When you\u2019re feeling better you\u2019ll think that\u2019s funny."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You can try but you\u2019ll never catch me. "},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well then you know her better than I do."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Give me that."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Anyone in?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well what do you want to write?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It was rife with historical inaccuracies. For example the tavern girl serving flagons of mead now her costume was obviously Germanic but in 1487 the Bavarian purity laws or Rhineheitsgebot severely limited the availability of mead. At best they would have had some sort of spiced wine."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Maybe he\u2019s having a lover\u2019s spat with Penny."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Uh-oh. According to this Mexican customs website visitors may not bring more than five laser discs 20 compact discs or 12 VHS tapes."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"The bigger question is what are you gonna eat with that spoon? You didn\u2019t get any food."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Glad I was sitting down for that. Did you and Amy get in a fight?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah-yeah which way?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well they can\u2019t cancel it. It ended on a cliffhanger."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Why is that good?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Bring a ball or a Frisbee you know something he can chase."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"But we don\u2019t have tattoos. What if someone asks to see our tattoos?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Is that racist? It feels racist."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re driving me to the mall. I\u2019m going to acquire a book that summarizes the current theories in the field of friendmaking."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh snap."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh. Oh well good for him. Yeah but why are you sitting here why don\u2019t you just go to a movie or something?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"The brake might be imaginary but that stop sign you just ran wasn\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh I disagree. Stuart is taller artistic self-employed and most significantly he gets 45 percent off comic books."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Have you seen the one where Lori dies?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Will you hold on to this for a couple of days?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Will you please stop joking around? I\u2019m trying to figure this out."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hold on hold on. So the three of us do all the work and only end up with 25%?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well as a male I have an evolutionary drive to perpetuate my DNA. Restricting myself to a single partner is against my nature."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What was all that about?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay so Kripke played a joke on you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh. Okay. A little musical foreplay. Terrific."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m being petty? You know Barry and I have a professional rivalry. You heard him he told me to suck eggs. If we were friends he would have suggested I suck something more pleasant. Why are you laughing? Did you learn something?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay look can we just please forget about all this extra stuff and can you just tell me what Leonard does?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I can\u2019t do anything right for you can I?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"We don\u2019t know. And if you don\u2019t answer the phone we can\u2019t know."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And I with you. Question are you seeking a romantic relationship with me?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"She doesn\u2019t mean it. She\u2019s just being nice."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hey guys."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well you were right tears."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Correct."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Actually I was\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Which one picks last?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Wine credit card and late night television are a bad combination."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Thank you.

Stuart and I have become good friends."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And she wonders why she\u2019s constantly undertipped."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Just do it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"120?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh damn."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So call her."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s putting on those cards but you are smarter than ever."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well my feelings were real when he was about to die."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Um what is that scent you\u2019re wearing? It smells great."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Come on."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yes Emily. Whatever. Where\u2019s Sheldon?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"A breakup would imply she was my girlfriend. She was a girl who was my friend who is now a girl who is not my friend."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No let her go."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Uh can I just say I\u2019ve missed all of us hanging out together."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well hey okay.

Or the plague."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Where does he poop?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No good Sheldon doesn\u2019t float."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It\u2019s just a phone."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah it\u2019s also a wand."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Ah. So it is. I guess we both share blame on this one."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Mm. So why don\u2019t they just get more drywall?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"It wasn\u2019t me. But she was also an actress and we were both up for the same part in a toothpaste commercial. She got it. Look I was so jealous. But instead of ripping out her fake blonde hair\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Because the print they\u2019re showing on Friday has an additional 21 seconds of previously unseen footage."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m not a big fan of musicals but I love that show."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yes Leonard I am insecure.

When I called him he had nothing to do so I just thought it would\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Are we all up to date on our yellow fever inoculations?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Probably. What\u2019s your point?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case. Leonard did it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I was hesitant the first time I tried it but I experienced an unanticipated and remarkable release of endorphins. It\u2019s quite satisfying."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Enjoy the accolades now Wil Wheaton but like your time on Star Trek Next Generation your smug self-satisfaction will be short-lived."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I am Shiva the destroyer I will have the woman!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah I have to say I thought the toilet humour would get less funny with repetition. Apparently there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop. "},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Wait is anything gonna jump out of that."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah. Like when you took Sheldon to Texas and showed him all around NASA you didn\u2019t even think to ask me and Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay big buddy. See you tonight guys. "},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Eleven."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well look at that even when I\u2019m causing problems I make the world a better place. Hey next why don\u2019t we tackle your penchant for whining and Penny\u2019s love of the ol\u2019 glug-glug?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019ve made a horrible mistake."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah but I do."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh Leonard\u2019s mad at me so I\u2019m making him lemon bars."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s kind of a fashionable look these days."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I call for a vote of no confidence and an immediate change in leadership."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh. Hang on. You got a you got a little something. Ah."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Amy\u2019s mad at me and I\u2019m not clear why."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sorry somebody\u2019s sitting there."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wash those bea\u2026 Oh I get it a little hazing for the new fella. Yeah I\u2019d better keep and eye out for what shoe polish on the microscope or mad cow disease in my grilled cheese sandwich?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey you do your experiments I do mine."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Are we done with this?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"He does that to me too. Why do we put up with it?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No she was pretty clear about wanting to keep her options open."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s cool. Go back to Kevin."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Incredible. You managed to screw up the screw-up."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I see. Well I think I\u2019ll be going."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I know I was there."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You mean where they were advanced enough to invent an interstellar warp drive but a black lady still answered the space phone?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Look I get it but before we pass up on an incredible opportunity I was thinking about when Howard was training to go to space they put him in a simulated environment."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I have an alternate proposal."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I don\u2019t know. They\u2019re dressed very stylishly. They\u2019re probably stuck-up. This is ridiculous. The next person that walks by no matter who it is they\u2019re the one. We\u2019re gonna die here."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"\u2026.."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m here to return your belongings. That\u2019s what people who\u2019ve broken up do."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No that would be incongruous I was going to lower the whole voice to a more pleasing register."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh okay. Got it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Um let me just have some coffee first and then I\u2019ll have the strength to tell you how much I won\u2019t be doing that.  Hello?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay! At what point did you begin to feel lost?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No no no no I need you now."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Not challenging? I was humiliating the man. I was thinking of writing a book called A Brief History of the Time I Made Stephen Hawking Cry Like a Little Girl."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So if you don\u2019t like Star Wars why are you here?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"But next time we\u2019ll be cat burglars."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I don\u2019t know like 50 cents. I\u2019m not sure."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay I\u2019ve found the perfect solution. We get off the train at the next stop in Oxnard. We then take the 113 train back to Union Station. We take a cab back to the apartment get my flash drive and then race to San Luis Obispo where assuming the lights are with us and minimal traffic we\u2019ll meet the train."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"On Earth? In our lives? That that that we\u2019re living?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What speech?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Is that really what you want to talk about Leonard?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Whatever. It would have been nice to hear it from you."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Better?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"He lied about the cream cheese. He ate the whole thing. I saw him."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"He does on Wednesdays."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"They are too."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sheldon she wanted to show you off to her family and you stood her up okay? Look at this adorable smushy face. Smush smush smush smush."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Uh Xbox One."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I told you she exists."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Technically it would only be rebound if he and Penny had actually engaged in physical intimacy."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019m worried about the New Horizons space probe."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"So should we go talk to him?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"That cannot be true."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"One second. Okay I think we\u2019re close. How do you feel about a mini-fridge in my room?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Nothing flamed out. We don\u2019t have to have sex every night you know."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Nope."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s not fair. I got stuck behind a tree."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well I wish I could."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hey hey do you hear yourselves? Let\u2019s just you know all calm down and take a step back."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019ll get my chisel."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":" That\u2019s right good job. Hello. Uh you wanted to see me?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay we\u2019ve got fajitas with all the fixins so you make your own."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes. Yes. My brain is better than everybody\u2019s."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And good-bye to you sir. He\u2019ll be back."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What did he say?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thank you. Seriously please don\u2019t make me go."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No. Do you?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh it\u2019s good. I just wish Leonard would work up the courage to tell Sheldon he\u2019s moving in here."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Why did I pee before I decided to move in here?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey you look great. Good for you Priya. I could never get that stupid hoodie off him when we were\u2026 well you look great."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"My mom bought me those pants."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Please. You\u2019re looking at Facebook to find out how their date went."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"There\u2019s a 200-watt uninterruptible backup power supply."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Chat? We don\u2019t chat. At least not offline."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh please.When it comes to Terminators you\u2019ve got a better shot of scoring with Arnold Schwarzenegger."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Wait. Get up get up!  Swear you won\u2019t tell Sheldon what happened!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh b-be careful. Give him some line. Okay now reel him in."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay he\u2019s in the bathroom let\u2019s go."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh no."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It can\u2019t be four revolutions it\u2019s got to be seven."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Look at him caring about what\u2019s wrong with me. That is some top-shelf empathy. Hey well we should start a club."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Our babies will be smart and beautiful."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Um I have a question."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"And it wasn\u2019t when we were driving like this?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And divide it how I\u2019m telling you we cannot do this without Wolowitz."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Doc you\u2019ve got to see what you\u2019re doing is is a little creepy."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Pasadena city college?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah this morning he used a stick of butter as deodorant."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s a\u2026 "},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh yeah yeah sure I guess."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well since you\u2019re here I\u2019d like to get your opinion on something. In honour of Black History Month I portrayed George Washington Carver in a loving tribute that my roommate called wildly racist. What do you think?  Hi. My name is George."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Bernadette please tell your boyfriend to cool it with the cow jokes."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Ever since I was a little boy my father wanted me to be a gynaecologist like him. How can I be a gynaecologist I can barely look a woman in the eye. You know what I\u2019m not going to let my parents control my future any longer it\u2019s time for a showdown. Somebody give me a computer with a webcam."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well then may I suggest you get a very long stick and play panty pinata."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh thank you. I wasn\u2019t sure I was gonna to make it. But my mother gave me some ice chips my sister told me to breathe and I just thought to myself Sheldon if you can make it through the Green Lantern movie you can make it through this."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"If you want we could tell you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thank you. Why is a world-renowned scientist staying in our apartment instead of a hotel?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You may have gone to Cambridge but I\u2019m an honorary graduate of Starfleet academy."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh-oh. I just remembered where the emergency key is."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s just such a big decision. I don\u2019t want to have any regrets."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Nothing. It\u2019s not suspicious that I\u2019m fixating. It\u2019s consistent with my personality."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"No no no I\u2019m going to have a me day. First I\u2019m going to go to one of those spas in Koreatown take a steam and get a massage. Then I\u2019m going to stop at a pet store and get licked by puppies."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m having dinner with Priya at Raj\u2019s. I think Howard\u2019s going to be there. You want to join us?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Astro means star."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Just roll the dice."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"The new neighbours are weird."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well it\u2019s not that late. You could still go out and look for number 32. Good night."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So wait if my career took me somewhere else you might not go?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I just eat the little crispy ones you don\u2019t like."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yes. Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It\u2019s a lease."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Szechuan Palace closed two years ago."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I\u2019d like that. This is turning out to be a perfect Saturday."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"How is super-aging any different than like doing crossword puzzles?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Penny for the thousandth time I\u2019m saving myself for someone special. Perhaps a cute bespectacled neuroscientist with hair the color of mud."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hold on. Is it back pay or is it a gift?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That\u2019s actually good. Why didn\u2019t I think of that?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Just leave! Okay now. This is the way it\u2019s supposed to be. Men together fighting the forces of evil."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You know let\u2019s just come up with something new."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"That\u2019s great. I\u2019m broken too."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh no it\u2019s okay. I just found a wobble."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Check."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah sure."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I am. You know and in an effort to reduce awkwardness as we learn how to function as friends I printed out a list of safe topics for polite conversation."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You\u2019re blowing this for me!"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay. Penny two of the brightest stars in the night sky are Altair and Vega. And it is said they were deeply in love but forever separated by the celestial river of the Milky Way."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"We\u2019re just keeping it casual."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What information?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay Sheldon. Yeah I\u2019m putting you in charge of my finances. I will not spend another penny that you don\u2019t authorize."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You know what? I missed you too."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I know. When will this nightmare end?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Just to help her with her screenplay."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What never?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No I think we\u2019re just gonna have a quiet weekend at home."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I wear dorky T-shirts and glasses."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I uh I\u2019m sorry to put you through that."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah and Leonard\u2019s mother\u2019s already here."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"One at a time.  What was that?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well that\u2019s that. The room\u2019s compromised. They\u2019ll have to change all the filters probably shut it down for weeks."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay you know what\u2019s not romantic? Rubbing it in someone\u2019s face."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Thanks! I mean the e-mail doesn\u2019t bother me as much as the vacation pictures of him in a bathing suit."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Woah Leonard and Priya are living together? That\u2019s big."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"He was so busy figuring out how many parts per million of urine we\u2019d be floating around in he didn\u2019t even question it."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay great you can tell him you hate him. Sign here."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s actually 01100111."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hold on I believe that social convention dictate you not arrive empty-Handed. Would you like to bring some Cylon toast?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"For all those girls out there looking for the Indian Monopoly man?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay your problem is you\u2019re trying to do this all by yourself."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Raj don\u2019t dangle false hope in front of Leonard like that."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You guys are aroused right?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"But if we were part of the team that confirmed string theory we could drink for free in any bar in any college town with a university that has a strong science program."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Amy this is crazy. You have nothing to be suspicious about."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Is the trick making him disappear? Sure let\u2019s see it."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You\u2019re so full of it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay where is this coming from?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Where have you been?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And kind of delicious.

I can\u2019t make up my mind."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay stop that. No more preschool talk. Tonight is about having fun."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You know I thought cleaning out a dead professor\u2019s office was gonna just be boring but then I found his dentures and realized it\u2019s also gross."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Do you have a problem with Justin staying with me?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well you can\u2019t be sure of that. What if the helium dealer rats us out? What if Kripke asks where we got it? What if the university checks my family tree and finds out I don\u2019t have an Uncle Harvey?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well I I thought about\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It might also interest you to know that Wil Wheaton currently ranks sixth on my all-time enemies list right between director Joel Schumacher who nearly destroyed the Batman movie franchise and Billy Sparks who lived down the street from me and put dog poop on the handles of my bicycle."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019ve asked me to lie on your behalf and as you know I am deeply uncomfortable with impromptu dishonest so I\u2019ve provided you with an iron clad alibi. You couldn\u2019t have spent last night with Priya because you were with another woman."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Also since the time machine doesn\u2019t move in space you\u2019ll end up in 1876 Pasadena."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah well it\u2019s in our contract to serve on a university committee. And frankly this is one I believe in. Okay here we go. Encouraging more women to pursue a career in the sciences."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh I call dibs on the Golden Age Flash."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"And I\u2019m just hearing about this now?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Good. Good."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You should go \u2019cause you want to go not because you have to."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No no. I was just sitting at home thinking about how it might be nice to catch up with my ninth favourite person."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I was really hoping to see a cattle drive."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Come on Leonard this is just a PR stunt."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I don\u2019t understand."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well that\u2019s what the bullies at Bruce Lee\u2019s high school thought. And then bam. Karate."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Is somebody working on that?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"There perfect."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Did you hear that? A mop. I have two PhDs yet somehow I\u2019m the janitor of my sister\u2019s birth canal."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I know. Watching your boyfriend run around with a broomstick between his legs isn\u2019t something you forget."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Your problem."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"If I was at a train station and one train could take me to my current job and the other train could take me to an audition for a movie which train should I get on?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh.

The guy who lives next to me is always like I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony. But wait until I tell him I\u2019ve got a time machine on my balcony. Stuff that in your speedos Jacuzzi Bob!"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what you want at all."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well off the top of my head I\u2019d have to go with Excalibur. It gives you the right to rule England."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh come on really? "},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Tag. You\u2019re it. "},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019ll appreciate this. Leonard has some ridiculous notion that you\u2019re mad at me. Tell him you\u2019re not mad at me. Go ahead set him straight."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Not on Blu-ray. Only twice on Blu-ray."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No-one\u2019s going to ask if I spent the night with Raj\u2019s sister."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I don\u2019t want to say because I don\u2019t know how much it is."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey do you think the elastic woman in The Incredibles needs to use birth control or can she just be a diaphragm?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Why are you yelling at me?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well there\u2019s actually big news on the Amy front.

Read."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh I heard him interviewed on the radio. You know when they told him he won he didn\u2019t believe it but then he did believe it. It was so funny."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I just wanted to make her work for it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay I found the box. Now what?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Your father\u2019s a gynaecologist."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I know. And it wasn\u2019t easy. Do you have any idea what it\u2019s like to wait for years and never know if you\u2019re going to finally get satisfaction?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"If you\u2019re not happy why don\u2019t you just let Kripke have the office?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Buddy I know me moving in with Penny feels like a big change but it\u2019s not."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I got a brand-new bikini so drinks at the pool are on these."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What would you name him?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You did make that up right?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Maybe. I I don\u2019t know.It\u2019s late I should I should go. Look I do get what you\u2019re saying. Instead of desperately clinging to any woman who will go out with me I need to work on my fear of being alone."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah you probably had it coming."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Fairy God Monster I win. Your desperate need for friendship makes you weak."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh God did you watch Bridget Jones again?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh come on. It\u2019s not boring at all. She\u2019s currently helping set up a secondary derivative market which would allow overseas car firms to hedge their investments against potential advancements in battery technology. Hmm?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wait. Is this really worth it? We\u2019ve lived together for years with nary an argument."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What? You\u2019re okay with an experiment where you have to answer awkward questions about your innermost feelings?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Now Sheldon\u2019s popular? What is happening?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh yeah. No we were just going."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No no Princess Punchali from The Monkey and the Princess."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well I just asked her if I should start watching the new Flash TV series."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You\u2019re you\u2019re a good friend for trying to help but I\u2019ve made my choice."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Come on they would be so cute on me and ah they go great with this sweater!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh. Okay. Oh. Oh. Hey."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I would advise the three of you that resistance is futile. I have endless patience. I once spent two-and-a-half hours on hold with Hewlett-Packard customer service just to complain about their customer service."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s how you do it Wolowitz. Now you see why he\u2019s famous and you\u2019re not."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Down the road? Sheldon she wanted to share a toothbrush holder with you and now you\u2019re at an ice cream parlour trying to pick up women."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh really? Because I remember you saying that this trip was going to be something we could both enjoy. Did you mean that or were you just trying to trick me?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You must be Leonard\u2019s mother."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I know me too. But it will be fun to have a prom without all the drama."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a bachelor party. There could be strippers. Wouldn\u2019t that make you a little jealous?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I can see."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I thought someone looked brighter and tighter."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well then what took you so long?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"All right come on come on.

Thanks for asking."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"But I don\u2019t want to go to bed."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"It\u2019s a non-optional social convention."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Seriously? You went first after only two weeks? That\u2019s bold."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What is it?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"With your sales record you have nothing to worry about."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yoo-hoo! Over here!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s football nomenclature for when a quarterback is tackled behind the line of scrimmage."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You can\u2019t live here."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh yes. Oh okay. Uh Good night. I don\u2019t know maybe it\u2019s the fumes from the urinal cakes but I feel like something is happening between us."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon this is not a big deal.

Uh here is a microscopic view of the cells."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Why not?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Stephen Hawking liked our paper. Said the premise is intriguing."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Really? They\u2019re going to make a robot that spits on your hamburger?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah he is pretty stupid."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You know I don\u2019t want to tell you how to do your job but when a mouse completes a maze it gets a food pellet."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh and the fairy tale continues."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well don\u2019t worry. He went to MIT. He can solve any problem as long as it doesn\u2019t originate in a Russian man\u2019s colon."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Fine."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hi. I\u2019m Penny. This is my friend Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hey Claire. Good you\u2019re here. Guys this is my friend Claire.

I\u2019ve got your back."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"The best one I ever had!"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019m glad that men are wearing hats again. They\u2019re so distinguished."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well you should. 50% of marriages end in divorce but 100% of make your own sundae bars end in happiness."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thanks."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Penny\u2019s working tonight I\u2019m in."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Stay I\u2019ll get her."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I was wrong. This is worse."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Lobsters overnight?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay every other month."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Get out!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"In what universe?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Otherwise we\u2019d love to."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It\u2019s Koothrappali. I have to tinkle."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Don\u2019t worry. Everything I have I share with her. Including my friend Leon\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t want to go home."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Because when I speak at a regular volume no one seems to believe me that I\u2019ve put this Amy nonsense behind me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Odd President Seibert posed the exact same question."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Gentlemen I have figured out the perfect way for you to irritate me. I\u2019d like you to be my intellectual sparring partners. From now on when I make an assertion I need you to challenge it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Better than watching a guy in a fur cloak ride a girl\u2019s bike? Nope."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey Stuart I see you\u2019re getting ready for your Halloween party."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve been following the news Leonard but there have been some terrific advancements in the field of torture."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Howard Raj and I just had a team meeting."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Indeed. I was the world\u2019s smartest caterpillar. And then after pupating in our nation\u2019s railway system I\u2019ve burst forth as the world\u2019s smartest butterfly."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well that is the grown-up thing."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yeah you keep setting me up for failure."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What? You can\u2019t fire me. I\u2019m the star. I\u2019m the girl that goes bananas. It says so on the poster."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Of course I do. The essence of the custom is that I now have to go out and purchase for you a gift of commensurate value and representing the same perceived level of friendship as that represented by the gift you\u2019ve given me. It\u2019s no wonder suicide rates skyrocket this time of year."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Like what?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Given this situation I have no choice but to withdraw my previous objections to your ill considered relationship with Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m not going to watch the Clone Wars TV series until I\u2019ve seen the Clone Wars movie. I prefer to let George Lucas disappoint me in the order he intended."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Mm. Last night I had a dream we got so rich from the app you and I bought matching side-by-side mansions. But there was a secret tunnel connecting your front yard to my back yard. What do you think that means?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah I really didn\u2019t think this through."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes but not of the same species."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well there was a lot at stake."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Um uh in a hundred years you\u2019ll both be dead and it won\u2019t matter?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well we\u2019re always the good guys. In D&D we\u2019re lawful good in City Of Heroes we\u2019re the heroes in Grand Theft Auto we pay the prostitutes promptly and never hit them with a bat."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Alright I\u2019ll be right back."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well with Wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend Christie"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Really? The only adult?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay so it\u2019s four seventy-five for a signed black-and-white and nine ninety-five for a colour."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You realize if the military declares our research classified they can take the whole thing away from us."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"He does want that. Does a man with my intellectual gifts play paintball on weekends?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What window?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah I used to be uncomfortable around people but then I learned a trick. I pretend everyone I meet is a beloved character from Star Trek."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"All right who\u2019s ready for another beer?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"\u201cTime travel? I don\u2019t understand\u201d said Amelia. Cooper stared at her. \u2018Which word don\u2019t you understand time or travel?\u201d"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You know what?

Spend five seconds and come up with one idea on how to get more women into science."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Just explaining the theory of relativity. Twice."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay. Uncomfortable silence it is. Hey Sheldon have you told Amy what it was like for you growing up in Texas?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"All right. He \u201chas\u201d a \u201cgirlfriend.\u201d"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well no-one\u2019s going to run a DNA test on it Leonard honestly you over-think everything."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"There was something wrong with that detergent. That was way too bubbly."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s a little thing but you really do miss it."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"No. People just keep kicking me out everywhere I go."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Luckily for you this is not a nuclear reactor."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay fine I accept your apology now get out."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Are you really admitting defeat?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I spent the night in Mexico with Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No I\u2019m making flower barrettes. See? I call them Penny Blossoms. I made one for myself then all the girls at work wanted one. Then I showed some to this lady who runs a shop in Old Town. She sells cards and homemade jewellery. She said she wanted to sell them. I said okay and in one week I made a $156."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"My head what about yours?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh it\u2019s fun."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Research journal entry one. I\u2019m about to embark on one of the great challenges of my scientific career teaching Penny physics. I\u2019m calling it Project Gorilla."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"But I think it would be comforting."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Mrs. Davis I uh I must confess I came here tonight in a futile attempt to pick up some lonely postdoc but instead I got to connect with you at a human level. That\u2019s a much better evening. You\u2019re a lovely person."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No it\u2019s not Amy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No. They asked me to leave so they could speak privately."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I am perfectly comfortable speaking to small groups. I cannot speak to large crowds."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Point of order. As you\u2019re in distress it would be customary for me to offer you a hot beverage. But I\u2019m a guest in your home so it would be customary for you to offer me a beverage. How do you want to proceed vis-a-vis beverages?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No it doesn\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well I don\u2019t have to pay taxes on this stuff."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You went to the comic book store without me.7"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Stupid Aquaman."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh my goodness look at this room!

Well a few years ago he did go out with a woman who had a PhD in French Literature."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Bernie I just forwarded you a list of the top five lactation consultants in Los Angeles. I know my favourite but I\u2019d love to hear what you think."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay that right there that equivocation and self-doubt that is not the American spirit. Did Davy Crockett quit at the Alamo? Did Jim Bowie?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah I am indeed. I have decided instead of wallowing in sadness about Amy it is time that I find myself a new female companion."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m going to talk anyway."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"The car was a gift it was something you needed. I was happy to help you out."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And apparently Wil Wheaton\u2019s best friend."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"The only thing we can do. Watch TV on our phones until the criminals return and bludgeon us to death in our sleep."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I thought she was a highly evolved creature of pure intellect like me.

Would you mind taking Cinnamon for a walk?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Don\u2019t you dare use science against me. Science is my best friend. Oh good I\u2019m back up to eight."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So it\u2019s not really like that?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What do you want me to do? You started this. Do you want to go over and tell him we\u2019re broken up?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Of course I haven\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wait. Here who is where?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Thankyou. And once again my baloney likes girls. Wait-wait. You don\u2019t want to put a bit of that in your mouth without trying my homemade chantilly cream. Yeah okay that time I heard it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"He\u2019s calling to ask you a favour. You might be confused because he didn\u2019t use the words Penny Sheldon please or favour."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Here you go. Oh you owe me another two dollars. The price of mu-shu pork went up."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It\u2019s uh been a long time since I\u2019ve seen a girl\u2019s really not her shoulder."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right why don\u2019t we open it up to Q&A from the audience?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It wasn\u2019t a pyjama party.

God."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I say you tell Alex your heart belongs to Penny I provide her a shoulder to cry on and then roughly half a year later I give it to her good."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"D-d-d! That\u2019s where I sit."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well they say at the end of your life you regret the stuff you didn\u2019t do more than the stuff that you did and I\u2019m pretty sure Alice is the stuff I want to do."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I think we already have. Thank you guys so much. Let\u2019s see if you fit in my man purse."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I get that but why is this so hard?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"She needed money. You seem under pressure. Did I not lend you a sufficient amount? Because I can give you more."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey Leslie."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay. Well then uh first things first. Um are you familiar with the Brachistochrone problem?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey do me a favour and take table seven."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Did it have a metal toilet next to the bed?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sure why?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I heard you ask it over and over. How is it inappropriate for me to ask it once?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Knight to old woman six-and-a-third. Brilliant move. Thank you.  Will the two of you excuse me?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No. Maybe. I don\u2019t know."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh look. You huh you just you got it all right there.

That was a big milestone for me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re overestimating the tensile strength of the substructure you\u2019re building."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":" Ladies?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well for Penny it\u2019s dancing night."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Unbelievable."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"How did you know you were a giant if everything was to scale?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh I\u2019ve got some bad news. There\u2019s no cell service in here."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Mine."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey we could liberate some micro-porous charcoal from the chem lab."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I don\u2019t really know how to say this."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m sorry so eventually zombies are going to attack the rehab facility where Sandra Bullock is?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"How are we doing?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Owner father soul mate and if anything happens to her your worst nightmare."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay. Listen the truth is I don\u2019t want him living with me."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I think he misses his little buddy."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"We can\u2019t. He was already fixed when I found him at the shelter."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well I don\u2019t sell my friendship that cheaply."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You\u2019re right! Yay!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"The notebook isn\u2019t in the bathroom."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh damn it. I told Amy that in the strictest confidence.

This seemed so elegant at the time but now I realize I was just a simple country boy seduced by a big city theory with variables in all the right places."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"We\u2019re not living together."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"The drawbridge is lowering."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Come on yoga top. Mama needs a new yoga top."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I honestly don\u2019t remember."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019ve always been a little confused about this. Why don\u2019t Hindus eat beef?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"No she didn\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Love?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Does Stephen Hawking roll through the quad?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"All right.

Amy and Bernadette. Why did you lie to us?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I don\u2019t know where your pants are but we did find your underwear in a pot on the stove."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"All right well that doesn\u2019t prove anything."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay I\u2019m sorry. Did we get off on the wrong foot? Because since the other night I kind of feel like you might have a problem with me."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah. And who knows how Amy will react."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And then you put it back compromising the integrity of all the other onion rings."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah.

This is a banner night for female genitals."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh it all comes down to this."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Earlier today I invited Professor Stephen Hawking to join me in the popular online game Words with Friends. Moments ago he accepted my request. Do you understand what that means?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m sorry are you suggesting that if we let Penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What happened?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh oh oh I have a reason. It could be because you said yes to marrying Zack but every time Leonard\u2019s proposed he\u2019s gotten a resounding no. Yeah that\u2019s just off the top of my head."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That is the most sickeningly sweet thing I have ever experienced. And I am sipping Kool-Aid through a Red Vine."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Individual relish packets?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That\u2019s because we are."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019ve heard that before but then the next thing you know I\u2019m hiding in my bedroom blaring a Richard Feinman lecture while my mom is shouting that Jesus would forgive her if she put ground glass in my dad\u2019s meatloaf and my dad\u2019s on the roof skeet-shooting her Franklin Mint collectible plates."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re a carrier.

You\u2019ve been complaining about Stuart living here for the past year. I don\u2019t see you showing him the door."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I will graciously overlook the fact that she is an arrogant sub-par scientist who actually believes loop quantum gravity better unites quantum mechanics with general relativity than does string theory.

If you have the right figure for it they\u2019re adorable."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s a good idea.

Maybe I didn\u2019t go to college when I was eleven like you maybe I got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16 but you are not the only person who is smarter than everyone else in this room. No offense. And I am clearly not the only person who is tormented by insecurity and has an ego in need of constant validation."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m fine."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I can\u2019t wait to ask Stan Lee why he insists on giving all his characters first and last names that start with the same letter."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh that\u2019s so sweet.

Miss Rostenkowski would you like to start us off by discussing your assessment of science\u2019s responsibility to society?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I guess we let them wait until they\u2019re old enough and let them choose their own theory."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"No! Not enchanted bunny!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That\u2019s pretty cool."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Got it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Something remarkable.

You two look happy how do you do it?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Aw."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What\u2026 what kind of a kiss?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Wow I get it because Dr Leonard Hofstadter can\u2019t date a girl without a fancy college degree."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay who wants a drink?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Da-da-da-da da-da-da!"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It\u2019s the least I can do for helping me carry my stuff up."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hey there he is there\u2019s my old buddy-bud-bud."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No it\u2019s this Friday at eight."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Because it\u2019s not a costume it\u2019s a flight suit."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You called me feminine. And I I wanted you to think I was more manly."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thank you. What did he say?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh God. I think I see where this is going."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Fine. In the interest of preserving our friendship\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019d say damn it in Klingon but that wasn\u2019t until next month."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh me too. You\u2019re so caring. I\u2019ve often pictured you guiding a young boy into manhood."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh what\u2019s that ring box?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Later losers!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Aw."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"All right it\u2019s got to go."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I have one question. Is this a prank where we land in Houston and you\u2019ve made up wanted posters that have my face with a moustache and a Spanish name and then I get arrested and deported to South America?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sheldon you are a grown man haven\u2019t you ever been sick before?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wow. Your life\u2019s amazing."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Try to keep up Howard I\u2019m killing it."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yeah he\u2019s over it that\u2019s why he\u2019s been whining all day about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from Men in Black."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I know. You want to get a picture?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t follow."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019ve been seeing Penny behind your back."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Read another one."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Rut? I think you mean consistency. And if we\u2019re going to abandon that then why even call it Thursday? Let\u2019s call it Quonko Day and divide it into 29 hours of 17 minutes apiece and celebrate it by sacrificing a goat to the mighty god Ra."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Anyway should you have any interaction with her it would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"He never went back to the university?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Perhaps some of his mojo will rub off on us. Maybe between this and his beach house we will be inspired to greatness."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Because Leo is a middle child."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"And I\u2019m just hearing about this now?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No Mr. smarty-pants. I ignored the fill gas tank light."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh thanks Raj it\u2019s vanilla oil."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thanks yeah."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Come on. Sorry to bother you."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"How can you be embarrassed around me? I\u2019m gonna be in the room with you when you give birth."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m starting to think we\u2019re never going to see that pizza."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Come on dude I\u2019m exhausted and Tyra Banks says the most important item in your makeup bag is a good night\u2019s sleep."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well just this once you can count me as people too."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay Leonard put down the box let\u2019s talk."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yes but I think this is all a big misunderstanding."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"So have you and I returned to a social equilibrium?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah and I\u2019ve seen those legs. You might want to get some Drano."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah Leonard told me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Terrific but that kind of raises more questions than it answers."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"There\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah but you wouldn\u2019t be able to talk to yourself. I\u2019m a little low on cash."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s an annual science conference. We\u2019ve all been invited to speak."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey. You ready to go?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah well maybe she has interest in you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Wuh Penny."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Not at all. In fact I have got something for just such an occasion. I was starting to think I might never get a chance to give it to you. Good job."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes. From Szechuan Palace."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Anyway he had a bunch of outstanding tickets and a bench warrant so I you know I paid his fines."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Interesting. I mean it\u2019s not testicles on a cryostat but I like it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well I\u2019d hardly call this kidnapping. Where\u2019s the blindfold? Where\u2019s the duct tape? Where\u2019s the part where you call me and demand ransom and I try to keep you on the phone but you hang up seconds before I can trace it and then I say I\u2019m getting too old for this crud?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019ve read that there are great yogis who have such mastery over their bodies they can draw water in through their genitals."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I can\u2019t tell you that. I\u2019m bound by closet organizer\/organizee confidentiality."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So are our laptops."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Maybe it\u2019s a good thing we came here. It\u2019s like a lesson in what not to do."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Speaking of ending relationships when British Honduras became Belize they designed a new flag with a tree on it and I would like to hang myself from that tree."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Professor Proton is dead?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Spoiler alert! Spoiler alert."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Look I understand that breaking up with someone can be very painful\u2026."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Excuse me? Excuse me jailor?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I can\u2019t because if I don\u2019t show up she\u2019ll still be expecting you."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Just until he gets back on his feet which are looking pretty good in the boots I bought him for his birthday."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All I\u2019m looking for is an educated intelligent woman who shares my interests while retaining her own unique point of view. She should be kind patient and most important unable to imagine life without me by ten o\u2019clock tonight."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Um the online game? Sure."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Penny."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Then there\u2019s no excuse for this chicken. You know this situation with Koothrapali brings to mind a story from my childhood."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That\u2019s not what she\u2019s doing Leslie she\u2019s just trying to shore up her self esteem it has nothing to do with sex."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I am not putting that on the Internet. I don\u2019t want people to see this. I don\u2019t want to see it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What happened?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Intimacy in any form has been challenging for me but I\u2019d like to show her how important she is and it feels like now might be the right time."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So this is nice. First time we\u2019ve all gotten together to eat."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay some of my Facebook friends aren\u2019t geniuses. My point is if we\u2019re going to be a couple I should be friends with your friends."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I\u2019m just being a good house guest."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s already loaded. Just hit play."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Are you gonna make us pretend to be a bunch of lame characters with silly accents?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"This says Beyonce Bootylicious Dance Mix."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"My father\u2019s a gynaecologist I think I can handle it. And now I\u2019m gay."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Then you leave me no choice. I accept the job."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Boo wine! But yay trains. I\u2019m in."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh cream."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"She let me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No it\u2019s Leslie Winkle. It\u2019s a long story."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes Glenn! The only bird I ever loved."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It\u2019s a good thing."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I suppose you\u2019re here because I\u2019ve decided to be physical with my girlfriend and I\u2019ve never done that before."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What do you think? For doing the same crap he always does except to a judge. He has to stay in there until he apologizes."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You have to get to it eventually."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Genius. I was gonna say why does anyone think Sheldon\u2019s a genius? But I didn\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well I didn\u2019t until I heard that."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I see. Now are we talking date the social interaction or date the dried fruit?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So that sounds more like something you\u2019d say if you didn\u2019t want a relationship with someone. This isn\u2019t working out but I\u2019ll always have feelings for you. I\u2019m sorry I slept with your best friend but I\u2019ll always have feelings for you. Here\u2019s the thing Lisa I\u2019m into dudes now but I\u2019ll always have feelings for you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You hacked my facebook account?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well whenever I talk about how awful my mom was Penny will do anything to make me feel better."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay then."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Knight to queen\u2019s bishop-five."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Look I know shopping cheers you up but it\u2019s just not really my thing."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Wow so that means you\u2019re a doctor you\u2019re a doctor you\u2019re a doctor you\u2019re a doctor and Howard you know a lot of doctors."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What do you mean?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I\u2019m proud of you. You\u2019re taking this really well."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well that was a waste of time. I\u2019m such an idiot."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Another quest by Wolowitz? Count me in."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Look I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re upset with me but I just have to say it\u2019s nice to see the two of you on the same page."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I would not say that. No-one would say that a light year is a unit of distance not time."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Mm."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What he arrested you for that?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Maybe this time he\u2019s going to do it."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yes you made that brutally clear to me. What I was going to suggest is if that you\u2019re willing to wait until Sunday morning the Google satellite will be over Pasadena. You can have a wedding photograph from space."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah why would you?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"That\u2019s not what the forest smells like."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"So you\u2019re wandering all around by yourself? That\u2019s not the kind of hero\u2019s welcome an astronaut should come home to."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You\u2019re kidding."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Brrrr. Why are you smashing a flash frozen banana."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"With real puffing smoke?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Me-wow."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard Leonard. What is that? What is that?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh these are a little different. There\u2019s a tradition at elite universities\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"How can I call her you know I can\u2019t talk to women."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay I get it I get it. You are an emotionless robot."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Anyone in?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey guys what are you oh that\u2019s here cool."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Maybe maybe not. Maybe tomorrow I start a bongo band and tour the world."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I always thought I was more like a cuckoo bird. You know a superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds. Of course the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death. Luckily for you that\u2019s where the metaphor ended."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Really! Did you miss all the subtle indicators like me saying Howard I am upset."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well once again it\u2019s what I do."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay. Well then there\u2019s a couple of things you should probably know."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What does it say?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey! You don\u2019t have to be so mean!"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What did I do?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay well I\u2019m gonna have to call them and cancel the order."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh what a gentleman. Hey Sheldon. "},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Now if you\u2019ll excuse me the father of the atomic bomb wants a saucer of milk."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Now you\u2019re being a responsible patient. Now you may notice some tingling."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Is it too late for him to cancel?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I mean they didn\u2019t say anything but I just kind of felt like I was being a weird third wheel."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s over the wheelbase. Are you completely unfamiliar with the suspension characteristics of a pre-1980 Pullman-built Superliner Deluxe passenger coach?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Emily these are my good friends Howard and Bernadette. Guys this is Emily."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019m sorry?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Do little things like bring her a cup of coffee in bed."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"There\u2019s no shame in asking for a break."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Sheldor back online."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh I know but just Leonard and Penny think we\u2019re doing it and I don\u2019t want to disappoint them."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay I don\u2019t know where you just came from but it couldn\u2019t have been a team meeting because I\u2019m on the team and I wasn\u2019t there ergo the team did not meet."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well then you don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening. See Leonard refused to participate in a mandatory quarterly roommate agreement meeting. This is what a generation raised on Bart Simpson looks like."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"For science maybe you should."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Guess."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"So it spells Sheldon?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You\u2019re only making it seem more real for me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Guys our topic is encouraging women in science can you at least play a less sexist game"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yes Sheldon we are friends."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah I said I\u2019m fine. Stop talking to me."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I can\u2019t believe what I\u2019m hearing. This is deeply hurtful."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I think we both know if I come over we\u2019re gonna get back together and\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"So what are you in for?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I want soup."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And you\u2019re certainly not going to win a Nobel Prize."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Kind of. When was the first time someone called you sir?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay but this is the last time. Nice try blockheads."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Not surprising. Penny\u2019s emotional responses originate from the primitive portion of the brain known as the Amygdala while speech is centred in the much more recently developed Neocortex. The former can easily overpower the latter giving scientific credence to the notion of being rendered speechless.  Or maybe she just doesn\u2019t want to talk."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh my God you guys look adorable."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You should."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I thought we were the Lightning Sharks."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":" Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well I\u2019m just saying I don\u2019t have any real ties here so if I were to move to New Delhi we could you know go out."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Where did he pop the question? What did you say?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I thought that might take his mind off the cushion."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t see why not."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What about when you flipped the Mars Rover or lost Koothrappali\u2019s dog or almost drove off with that baby?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yeah I was. I was 200 pounds by the time I was in middle school. Kids were mean. Cows may be sacred there but it doesn\u2019t help if you look like one. Anyway I was pretty lonely so I had to make up my own stories and games and I promised myself if I ever made any friends that that I would play those games with them."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Wild Bill Witchcock."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I need to see this."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That was my first thought but all my cool stuff is here."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Very good. Chocolate?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You don\u2019t know my birthday do you?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh. Well I thought we were going in order."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Question how am I going to get Leonard a present before the party? I don\u2019t drive and the only things available within walking distance are a Thai restaurant and a gas station. I suppose I could wrap up an order of mee krob and a couple of lottery scratchers."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh. Hi Amy. How you been?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You just say uh Hey Siri what time is it?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Will you come visit me in India?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh yes."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I was. Now I\u2019m having a nightmare. What do you want?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Grab a corner. Whoa what\u2019s your hurry cowboy? Savour the moment."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I never bluff. Ten."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Fine you drink it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I just said couples sound great."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"They were clever Leonard. They exploited my complete lack of interest in what you were doing."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So you really think they liked it?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Uh 12 to 18 months from now depending on good behaviour."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Who cares as long as you pick me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You hypocrite!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Greetings."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes and when Franconi\u2019s went out of business we switched to Graziano\u2019s."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Why?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Look at these men. They\u2019ve managed to win the top science prize in the world with no more understanding of the quantum underpinnings of the expansion of the early universe than God gave a goose. You should pay attention Leonard. Someday this could be you up there."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You know we could\u2019ve come to you guys. You didn\u2019t have to bring the baby here."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Thank you for coming with me Sheldon. You\u2019re a good friend."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"This place is great."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Pardon. I just need to. yeah."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh my God Cinnamon are you okay? I can\u2019t believe you two. You do whatever it takes to save her life. If she needs new organs I\u2019ll buy any dog necessary and scrap them for parts."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Leonard\u2019s being a jerk so we\u2019re gonna watch over here."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Did you bring the dehydrated low-sodium soy sauce?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"The place really looks great."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh oh uh you could uh stand outside his window with a boom box in the air."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"There was a draft."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Do you mind? We\u2019re having a moment here."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey this is my natural hair colour. Now. So does Sheldon have anything special planned for you tomorrow night?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey. Ready to go to lunch?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"People compete for jobs and trophies why not me?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I never eat in strange restaurants. One runs the risk of non-standard cutlery."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"How about that guy? He looks like he\u2019d hate you."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What\u2019s with the gloves?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I like it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What\u2019s that?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You\u2019ve heard of him?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"If I knew you were waiting I would\u2019ve swallowed that lasagna whole."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No. No this isn\u2019t right. Our food always comes in Szechuan Palace containers."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What are you gonna do?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"But you\u2019ve been engaged for over a year now and you don\u2019t even have a wedding date."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Emily as I\u2019m sure you know I\u2019m considered an odd fellow. But what you don\u2019t know is that while I often say the wrong thing in my heart I mean well. I think that you are a smart and wonderful woman you know? And we all think that you can do better than Koothrappali."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Is something going on with him and Bernadette?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well that was rather unpleasant."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard is going to  the office."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay so here\u2019s the thing. I guess you\u2019re aware that Leonard asked me out."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Leonard?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Do I have to pull out the paperwork again?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yeah but if he\u2019s a sore loser maybe you\u2019re better off without him."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well Howard eating that pistachio was like when King Joffrey got poisoned."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All this years I\u2019ve been so wrong. The tinier the train the more concentrated the fun."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well if he does don\u2019t believe it. He\u2019s not above playing the dead meemaw card."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Can\u2019t stay long. I left Sheldon in the car with the window cracked open. He\u2019s gonna go through that activity book in like 30 seconds so\u2026 Are you okay?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"This is amazing. How did you even get this idea?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well there\u2019s no point in dwelling on it. As the Vulcans say Kup-fun-tor ha\u2019kiv na\u2019ish Du stau."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Why?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Because we love each other."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"All right um how about oh how about Rocket Man?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"This is a treat what brings you guys by?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"And I\u2019m happy to report its kickstarter campaign is holding strong at zero dollars."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Mm-hmm. How do you sleep in these things? Silk pajamas on satin sheets? I slid out of the bed like three times."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh and there\u2019s not even a bathroom on set. I have to go to the gas station across the street. I mean I was dressed like half an ape and still not even close to the most disgusting person in there."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay. How Thelma and Louise of us."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Nothing. We just pulled an all-nighter trying to fix a zero-gravity\u2026 pasta maker. I\u2019m gonna make a coffee run. Do you want any?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You don\u2019t have to make me anything."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What are you doing?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"How many women have you had dates with?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Penny?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"USA Today calls them exuberant fun for the whole family."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Cool. Can I say it fell apart because you were all I want to have your babies and I was like I\u2019m too rock and roll to be tied down?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Of course."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You said I could buy a desk."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay really I\u2019m fine."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"See? Ruined."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That is not true."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"That\u2019s what it says on the packet."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I am here right? You see me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t drink coffee."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":" Penny."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey hey hey hey. This is my Comic-Con makeup. I love you but there are some things a man doesn\u2019t share with his girlfriend."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Um."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well it could be for the monkey movie. It could be my haemorrhoid commercial. The list does not go on."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You need a break?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I\u2019m all for it."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I really can\u2019t thank you enough for taking me in. You know I was in a pretty low place in my life."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Congratulations. Does it have that new car smell?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh sure that\u2019s why I did it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Date night."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I change my answer. It it\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s hot. We can barely keep our hands off each other."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"That would explain why the sky was also on its side."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Absolutely. You name it we\u2019re doing it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Dried potatoes vegetable oil corn flower wheat starch maltodextrin salt and my favourite ingredient of all uniformity."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Maybe I can save her."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"That was all a lie? This year\u2019s gifts are already wrapped!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well I say that\u2019s the last time we ever go outside."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Calm down Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"There are post-prom mating rituals?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t understand."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Wait.

We cover ourselves in body paint and then then we get on this big canvas and do our thing."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I don\u2019t know. Maybe \u2019cause things are going so well between us lately and I\u2019ve been really happy."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"So?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Keep a lookout. This place is swarming with campus security. They will not hesitate to scold us."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s remarkable. All that time spent in fear. And for what? He\u2019s magnificent. Oh dear. I just realized I haven\u2019t offered you a beverage."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sorry Leslie I guess I prefer my space stringy not loopy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No Fig Newtons are named after a small town in Massachusetts. Don\u2019t write that down!"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hold on. Isn\u2019t there something else you wanted to tell him?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Because I\u2019m afraid to know the answer."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh yeah that. Come on in."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Now honey I already told you the hamburger meat is fresh and stored at a safe temperature."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You know what?

I\u2019m not going to the mall with someone dressed like a dumb space bear."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m not going. Would you like to know why?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay nice talking to you."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Why do you bounce with your hands in the air like that?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What\u2019s the difference?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"So if she wants to end her pair-bond with Leonard why on earth would she guzzle a witches\u2019 brew of his soda and spit?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah Leonard mentioned you were a psychiatrist."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It\u2019s true.

Let\u2019s divide up the loot."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right fine. If we\u2019re not going to give it a name can we at least give it a secret code designation?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I love you."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It was an accident. The doctor left the folder out on her desk. It\u2019s not my fault I opened it and looked."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wherever the music takes me kitten. I play bongos walking down the stairs.  Oh! Oh! Never play bongos walking down the stairs."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I know I went a little overboard.

Let\u2019s get out of here."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I can\u2019t hear you I\u2019m in the shower."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh boy if there is one thing that gets my goat it\u2019s those dad-gum insurance companies."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Really?

I would like this experiment to go well. Are there any insights you can share?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah I I I saw that article you\u2019re talking about. Uh the participants ask each other a series of questions designed to promote intimacy."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You can do both like Michael Jackson\u2019s Billie Jean. While you\u2019re dancing you\u2019re thinking like darn it whose baby is it?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I should hope so. When she called me an insensitive jerk I\u2019d like to think she meant it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What do you think?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What? He beat out George Clooney and that\u2019s something. Like I love me some Clooney."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Thank you.

So?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It was in the limo. They sent a limo. I have a limo. I just love saying limo. Here sip on this while you\u2019re getting ready."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"How else am I supposed to talk to the Human Resources lady?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"He\u2019s not saying it\u2019s a magic ring. You\u2019re not are you?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I can\u2019t do that to Leonard. This is some powerful panty-dropping stuff."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well I have to void my bladder. It was nice spending this time with you."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay. I posted it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh I\u2019m sorry. Well if it helps you feel any better you\u2019re doing very well so far. Next question are you fertile?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I have a question about Batman. Batman is a man who dresses up like a bat. Man-bat is a part man part bat hybrid. Now if Man-Bat dressed up as a man to fight crime would he be Man-Batman?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Fancy sounds like a compliment."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well what are you gonna do?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay alright let\u2019s assume your hypothesis. We went to dinner we talked we laughed we kissed where could I have possibly gone wrong."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Fantastic Four Daredevil Invincible Iron Man Happy Hogan Curt Connors\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I think she\u2019s smoking hot."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And how are you doing this fine evening?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Last one holding the ring decides its fate.

Congratulations."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So you think it\u2019s okay?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"All right. Let me give you a little girlfriend 101. Usually the first move out of the gate is you withhold sex but that will work better after Sheldon hits puberty. So I\u2019d say give him the silent treatment."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re right. Without realizing it I\u2019ve allowed that woman to alter my personality."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Did Leonard? I\u2019m no expert but I believe what we just heard from Penny was sarcasm.  Oh good. I\u2019m eight for 26 this month."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What is happening?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You go dancing every Wednesday."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That is not fair.

Clearly that cookie is mocking you. You\u2019d never hear that kind of sass from a Nutter Butter."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That is an antisocial implication."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right. That\u2019s it. We are now no longer companions boon or otherwise. We are now merely acquaintances. To amend the words of Toy Story you have not got a friend in me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m a real collector. How rare is it?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"How could he ruin the game?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Thank you for understanding."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay?

Leonard needs a DVD burner."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah Milk Duds with their self-deprecating name and remarkably mild flavour are the most apologetic of the boxed candies."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I have a craving for white asparagus that apparently is destined to go unsatisfied."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Is everything okay?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What do you think?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m sorry. I just never think of you having feelings like that."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Acting lessons. Interesting. It might help if I could act as though I care about my students and whether or not they learn."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You guys are really being calm about Penny and Sheldon doing this thing. If it were me I\u2019d I\u2019d be a little nervous."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh please the Hulk would never get across the border with that temper."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"We\u2019re not.

There was going to be a selfish petty person with a ring and three people who used to be his friend. Is that really what you guys want? \u2018Cause if it is fine I don\u2019t want anything to do with you. And I don\u2019t know what happened in that bathroom but I am not cleaning it up!  My precious."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Maybe. I I don\u2019t know.It\u2019s late I should I should go. Look I do get what you\u2019re saying. Instead of desperately clinging to any woman who will go out with me I need to work on my fear of being alone."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s right here on the bottom."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay that\u2019s just the plot for Dirty Dancing. What else would you love? Other than being lifted over Patrick Swayze\u2019s head."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Those things can still happen."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right. Last night you gave me some excellent advice regarding my problem here at home you kissed me and then vomited on and off for 40 minutes following which you passed out on your bathroom floor. I then folded a towel under your head as a pillow set your oven clock to the correct time because it was driving me crazy and I left."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What was your question again?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah. Leonard gave me an emergency key."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"And he\u2019s all like aren\u2019t you the guys from Footprints on the Moo-oo-ooh what is he doing?!"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh my goodness look at this room!

So stay on my good side or I\u2019ll get you a little something too."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I can\u2019t believe you bought a red cowboy hat."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Really? What is the craziest thing you\u2019ve ever done with a woman? And the time you and I had sex in the ocean does not count."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon you can still go on the trip in a few weeks. Just help us out."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Wet wall?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Kind of like when Firefly was cancelled. But not as big."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"They\u2019re just having a little trouble communicating. My dad says it\u2019s because the sound of my mom\u2019s voice makes him want to tear his ears off and sew them over his eyes so he never has to look at her again."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m back."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Or what if we fold them?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I would."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Had to wake him up from his nap didn\u2019t you?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You know just-just one thing. Look we\u2019re in a really great place right now and I don\u2019t want to do anything that will make stuff all weird again."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Qu\u2019vatlh "},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Not yet. How will I learn if I\u2019m comfortable living with Amy or just comfortable because I\u2019m in my own apartment? Now if this experiment is going to be valid I suggest a neutral environment."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"If you let me use negative reinforcement I can get it done before we go to bed."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thanks. It\u2019s really hard to find these in his size. So listen. I\u2019ve been meaning to talk to you about the other morning."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Come on you know I can\u2019t talk to women unless I\u2019m lit up like the Hindu festival of Diwali."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Wow excuse me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m back."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"For God\u2019s sake will you stop with the Schrodinger stuff."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah herbal tea for me please."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Good good. \u2018Cause no matter how hard I try I cannot get the twins to look alike."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sleepy ki\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay.

I suggest how thick can a soup get before it becomes a stew? You know the answer it may surprise you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh no no no crystals don\u2019t work."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"If she did it would be amazing. That woman can do no wrong."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"This is the worst. If we\u2019re gonna get shot down we might as well just go to a bar and do it old school."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Told ya."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Baffling right?

Hello yelly face."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey guys I got this."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You know surprisingly uh the letter from your father wasn\u2019t the most interesting thing I read in the closet.

Given the professional standstill you\u2019re at you\u2019re wondering if this is the appropriate time to abandon your research and focus on teaching. Yes. And if I may suggest consider changing disciplines. Yeah to the humanities perhaps history. One of the advantages of teaching history is that you don\u2019t have to create things you know you just have to remember stuff that happened and then parrot it back. You could have fun with that."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Are you insane? You\u2019re not going to party with them you\u2019re not even going to get anywhere near that place."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m sorry.

Very good. Now let\u2019s try Warrior 2. And hold."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Doctor Cooper."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh now they\u2019re so much smarter than dogs. Have you seen them on those little bicycles?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Awkward silence Sheldon on his phone no touching. Somebody\u2019s having date night."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh no bubble baths either. They can increase the risk of a urinary tract infection."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"If real dogs gave me buttons I\u2019d like them too. Well I think it\u2019s very nice that you\u2019re helping out our friend."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I\u2019m focusing on my job."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Not at all."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Great then we\u2019ll get married I won\u2019t be able to talk to her and we\u2019ll spend the rest of our lives in total silence."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey Stuart."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay I\u2019m getting some mixed messages here."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Really? You\u2019re going to risk getting sleepy in the middle of your thermodynamic fluctuations seminar? You know what happens when you yawn in public."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"No Stuart picked out those throw pillows all on his own."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well that\u2019s not surprising. That Baldwin lock on your door uses traditional edge mounted cylinders whereas the key for your Volkswagon uses a centre cylinder system."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"And if anything were to happen to you we will name our first born son Howard. I\u2019m just kidding. We\u2019ll name him Dalib after my grandfather."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Ooh that is a lot of hair. Ow. And now I\u2019m gonna hear it from Jenny."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"For starters they shed and bite."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay that\u2019s a lot of money. The wise thing to do is invest it in something practical. Like a jet ski."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"And since you love the truth so much why don\u2019t you tell Amy you don\u2019t want to live with her instead of blaming it on me?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh neat what\u2019s the occasion?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Forget helium. The real superfluid is the fruit punch in this mug. Reminds me of my daddy\u2019s secret don\u2019t tell mama juice."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh. That\u2019s why you were mumbling Mississippi."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Penny come back. I\u2019m sad for real now."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"It\u2019s no big deal. I\u2019m just a little behind on my bills because they cut back my hours at the restaurant and my car broke down."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Ah one name. Like uh Cher Madonna Adele. All the women who rock me. My name is Rajesh but you can call me Raj."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay maybe she was flirting with him but who cares? Look I don\u2019t even know where my relationship is with Leonard is right now."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So how\u2019s everything."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well what are you gonna do?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey a toast. Thank you all for your support while we worked on our Air Force project. And please know that we could not have done it without you so cheers."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh but what about the party?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"If they ever make a movie version of that book you know who should play Leonard\u2019s mother? Sandra Bullock."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Then what do we do?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yum. Well enjoy your big evening."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yes but only to clean."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Uh my plans with Priya."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay. Um here\u2019s the thing. So I\u2019ve known for a while now that Leonard has had a little crush on me\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Saturday nine a.m. Bring cash."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"When was the last actual exercise you got?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"May I suggest that your criticism is based on jealousy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s ridiculous."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Is this it? It was inappropriate to discuss Leonard and Penny\u2019s sex life in front of Leonard and Penny.  Oh good! Now I can eat."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"But you won\u2019t be living here."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Here\u2019s an idea why don\u2019t we just go out for Indian food."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Mm-hmm. Great. Hey can I ask you something?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"That\u2019s great."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"If we\u2019re all gonna die why am I eating so much kale?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hello I\u2019m Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

You will no longer be able to accuse me of being spoiled."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Nah if I want to see a naked dancing man I just flush the toilet while Leonard\u2019s in the shower."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well you should think fast because men can sire offspring their entire lives but those eggs you\u2019re toting around have a sell-by date."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It is on."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey guys. This is Lalita Gupta Lalita this is Leonard and Sheldon and Howard and Penny. Isn\u2019t it great she isn\u2019t fat any more!"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yeah nothing\u2019s been changed since he drove it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well he is. I\u2019m a wedding planner who can\u2019t find love himself. It\u2019s ironic but the point is we can\u2019t trust you. You\u2019re a sketchy character in a parking garage."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Excuse me. Uh bad news. The ma\u00eetre d\u2019 said it\u2019s gonna be at least an hour."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"No way dude!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No no no no no it\u2019s it\u2019s important to me that you have the bedroom you want."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh.

I\u2019m gonna say Cinnamon."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well do you support this?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah for what it\u2019s worth engaged people can look around too. Lot of options out there."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Toys? I do have a model rocket next to my bed."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wait. How do I know that you\u2019re not manipulating me right now?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"We didn\u2019t have a tree when I was growing up."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You ready?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I take it back. I believe it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hmm."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Can I see your stitches?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"But now you\u2019ll be able to make your own milk to eat the cookies with."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Why should I do something you\u2019re the one who introduced her to online gaming."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Then why are you attacking us?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I suggest you go through with it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Elegant."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Wow. You\u2019re going off to work with the military leaving me behind. Now I know how all those army wives feel."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Great. Your mom\u2019s not coming right?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"As you know Amy and I have been together a long time and a lot of things I never thought possible now seem possible."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Eh what\u2019s the matter with them is they think they\u2019re so smart they don\u2019t care if they hurt other people\u2019s feelings."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I was afraid of that.  Go ahead."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Not that one."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Fine."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Why?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well then you have my permission."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey. We just wanted to see how your class was going. Where is everybody?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"It\u2019s kind of a funny name though Smoot."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Level three and she thinks she\u2019s rich!

You know you\u2019d actually like my brother he\u2019s kind of a chemist. Anyway I was thinking I\u2019d have thanksgiving here and you are all invited."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Is this conversation making you uncomfortable?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Ah that\u2019s a good question. Apparently someone was being awfully flirty while not wearing their engagement ring causing another someone to show up here thinking the first someone might be available."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Then it\u2019s not chili. Real chili has no beans in it but you\u2019re from a foreign land so your ignorance is forgiven."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sorry! Pardon me! Oh I\u2019m so sorry! My fault! Check it out. I just got contacts."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"No never heard of \u2019em!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"When does that start?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Have you ever even seen a picture of Tesla?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s not your fault."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You can\u2019t sink. With all that helium in you you\u2019re lucky you don\u2019t float away."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You don\u2019t but the surgeon might hmm? And your carotid artery is just one shaky scalpel away from becoming the dancing fountain at Disneyland."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"So?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Uh okay let\u2019s see. They\u2019ve got spicy food and there\u2019s a chance you\u2019ll get diarrhoea."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"But we don\u2019t have tattoos. What if someone asks to see our tattoos?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I don\u2019t understand it. I\u2019m a nice guy I have a great job I\u2019m well-educated come from a good family. Why don\u2019t women want to be with me?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No it\u2019s true I did a series of experiments when I was twelve my father broke his clavicle."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay. Come on in."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right. Boone North Carolina. Every summer since 1952 Boone has hosted an outdoor amphitheater portrayal of the life and times of its namesake Dan\u2019l Boone. Sounds like something that would attract the wrong crowd. Penny you\u2019re from Nebraska correct?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"We do?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Not true. The fight or flight instinct is coded genetically. Instead of fleeing he chose to fight barehanded against a brawny member of the weasel family. Who\u2019s to say that I don\u2019t share that flawed DNA?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah but we all want to hear it from you."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I didn\u2019t pick up on that. That\u2019s a nice touch."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey anybody want a drink?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay I\u2019m not driving him."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I want that too. Why are you here?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Huh. Bill Murray did get it wrong."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Plus I understand you have to be standing next to the vehicle with your card when they arrive."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m given to understand his mother grounded him for running away."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Where\u2019d you get a beer?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"18 parts per million. And he\u2019s still doing it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What part of an inverse tangent function approaching an asymptote did you not understand?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"We don\u2019t have any kids."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Joke all you want but you think about it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"The question is moot. There is no way that Stuart an impoverished peddler of picture books would be at all appealing to Amy Farrah Fowler a noted neurobiologist capable of performing surgery on her own feet with nothing but nitrous oxide from cans of whipped cream as anesthesia."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You had to be taught not to burn down the forest?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You okay?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What if it\u2019s banditos shooting at us? What if we get kidnapped? What if we end up in a factory making Bart Simpson pi\u00f1atas for the rest of our lives?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"If you\u2019re gonna be a trophy husband for a rich wife you might want to watch your waistline."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Let me guess you want it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh dear."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yes that is wonderful. You will no longer be able to accuse me of being spoiled."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m sorry. Do you have other plans?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"A tremendous accomplishment would be if the planetary body he discovered were plummeting toward Earth and he exploded it with his mind."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Um Stanley Stanley Stanley Tucci?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Mr. Roper\u2019s dead? You can\u2019t just spring that on a guy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And I could not have done it without you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Thanks."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I think it sounds fun."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Ah now th-th-there you go. Always made it worse."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay. I don\u2019t get it you said make an effort here I am making an effort."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Engaging my olfactory sense helps make it real for me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Can I whistle?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m perfectly comfortable sleeping on a bouncy castle."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What happened now?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah me too."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Or we could just have a life."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What do you mean?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I heard a woman laughing."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well if that\u2019s the case is there anything I can do to help?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What would a toilet look like in Atlantis? How would you flush it? And when you did flush it where would the poop go?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard you have to do something about Penny. She is interfering with my sleep she\u2019s interfering with my work and if I had another significant aspect of my life I\u2019m sure she\u2019d be interfering with that too."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh of course not. She was just sniffing around your goods because she was hunting for truffles."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh clearly I could have."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"If there were a list of things that make me more comfortable lists would be on the top of that list. Okay now oh since last we spoke have you acquired any pets?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You didn\u2019t think I was gonna be in your kitchen this morning yet here I am."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay well anyways I brought you a day-old cheesecake to cheer you up!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hit the\u2026 Hey sweetie. Yeah I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m gonna be working late. I I I miss you too. Okay sure I\u2019ll call you when I get home. Okay bye-bye."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well I have a secret I\u2019ve been keeping from you too."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And no woos. Oh not you Dr. Woo. You\u2019re fine. I want you all to know that you have no reason to applaud me. My so-called breakthrough wasn\u2019t the result of my genius. It was nothing more than a boneheaded mistake. So please refrain from praising me for it in the future."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well nothing happened right? It\u2019s over. Until we get married a third time you guys will never have to see each other again."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah women do like a man that can support himself."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019d like to propose a toast to our friend Howard his um his big heart his beautiful soul\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hello."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What a nice girl."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No problem brother. Stay frosty.  We\u2019re still dating right?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah. That\u2019s better than what I did say which was fine I\u2019ll eat them with club soda."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh preposterous. I have been solely responsible for this university\u2019s six loop quantum gravity calculations I have changed the way we think about Bose-Einstein condensates and I am also the one who got Nutter Butters in the cafeteria vending machine. Maybe you missed that news while you were floating around like a goof in outer space. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me I have work to do."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Call me a romantic. I like to think that your Mark Ruffalo is still out there somewhere."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What else you got?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Can we please change the subject?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Really don\u2019t care."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019ll also help improve her initial impression of you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I hope so it was a snort of derision."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay when you say seeing Penny what exactly does that mean?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"There is nothing to say. Except I\u2019m the bigger man. I\u2019m not kidding. Say it."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Can I just stay in the garage?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Not really. Is that my yearbook?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"There\u2019s also a time to stop eating too many jelly beans. And it\u2019s when you\u2019re ten."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh Daddy you\u2019re so rich and funny."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Gentlemen Star Wars Day is rapidly approaching. We should finalize our plans."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Uh it\u2019s hard to say. I think we\u2019re good but things like this make me wonder if Emily\u2019s really the right person for me. I mean did you guys ever have doubts about each other?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Merry Christmas."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s probably for the best. For a lot of these guys the weekly trip here is the only chance their mom has to go down to the basement and change their sheets."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d say you\u2026 oh."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well they could monitor scientific publications and see if anyone posts such a cogent restatement in the next couple of months. If so the authors are most likely in possession of my stolen laptop."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Gee I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s in the cards sir."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay help me out. How are you doing this? Do they know about each other?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah I guess I am making decent money."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Thanks. And I taste good too."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"How could you send her away?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh-huh. The viewing area\u2019s right over there.

I\u2019ll come home for Sanjay\u2019s wedding."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Forget the sword Sheldon help Raj."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Because he\u2019s punishing me for being a quote condescending jerk. You don\u2019t think I\u2019m condescending do you?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yup. Bye."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So whichever rep has the best sales for the quarter gets a trip for two to Hawaii."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Artificial intelligences do not have teen fetishes."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hello."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You don\u2019t understand.

She\u2019s not my girlfriend you are."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So have you written anything I might have seen?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I did."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What? Where is this coming from?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Suffered in silence?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I don\u2019t want to do that."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"No I\u2019m not okay.

Jonah Jameson Jr."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard wait. No. I listened to your dumb thing. Leonard come back. Leonard come back.

I moved here from Nebraska to be an actress and now I\u2019m sitting in an engineering lab at Caltech helping to build a prototype for a high-tech guidance system."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What the hell?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well most of it is being applied to unravelling the secrets of the universe while the rest of it\u2019s wondering why I\u2019m having this conversation with you."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah but what if the experiment works?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay now that you\u2019re back on the team let\u2019s get you caught up."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"All right Pictionary. What are the teams?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I am not going to apologize. I\u2019ve done nothing wrong. He is completely overreacting."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Time for bed."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"All righty. What\u2019s new?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Using Kolinar to suppress my anger at that last comment."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What do we do? Should we call someone?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes I was in a taxi but the driver didn\u2019t look at all like the photograph on his license so I leapt out and ran for it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"How ridiculous is he?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Round two Leonard Hofstadter Darth Vader Rupert Murdoch."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m sorry you had to go through that."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"My sister told me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Just reset the board."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I\u2019d like to propose a toast to our friend Howard his um his big heart his beautiful soul\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay well make yourself at home."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Fine.

"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"GO AWAY!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You got to admit I am I\u2019m delightful."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yes very nice."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon Kripke\u2019s not smarter than you. You just got stuck on a wrong path. Happened to Einstein. He got stuck on the unified field theory for decades."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I wrote a fan letter to you when I was a child in Texas and you sent this autographed picture back to me. Do you remember that?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"While a thoughtful gift this comic book in this condition is worth at least a hundred dollars."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Because love trumps hate."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Are you fun in any of them?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay well I\u2019ll take you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"And you don\u2019t want to make the same mistake with the next woman."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Don\u2019t rush it. We may be dealing with befoulment on a molecular level."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well moving is a big deal. You have to go to the supermarket and get boxes and if they\u2019re not clean then your books smell like melons and it\u2019s just like\u2026 Why don\u2019t you just get a roommate and stay here?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Focused Locust."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh hey it\u2019s your business. Do whatever you want."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What\u2019s he doing here?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Penny wait."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"We blew up Feynman\u2019s van."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Perhaps he\u2019s emulating Shakespeare\u2019s Henry V who dressed as a commoner and mingled among them to find out how he was being perceived by his subjects. Course if he\u2019d have read any of the thirteen hundred e-mails I\u2019ve sent him on the subject of his administration he could have saved himself the trouble."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well there\u2019s a bar in the lobby."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Sure."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"And I was wondering if any of you guys would like to help me do it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah come on in."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What the hell is that."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"This? No. No of course not this was just you and me hanging out with a bunch of guys who didn\u2019t show up because of work and a colonoscopy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You missed Chief Science Officer Chairman of the Board and Head of the Secret Santa Committee."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Would they really do that?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You okay?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay we went out a little bit a long time ago but we were never like going out."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No I didn\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Mmmm by Odin\u2019s beard this is good Chex Mix."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hummingbirds are the vampires of the flower world."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You won\u2019t regret it. I\u2019m the most pathetic guy you\u2019ve ever met. And that boys and girls is how it\u2019s done."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That\u2019s a lot less big."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"She\u2019s not my girlfriend."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes. If I ever talk about going out with a girl again roll your eyes at me like I do to you when you say dumb things."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Howard if you\u2019re going to lie to your wife don\u2019t start the sentence with Sheldon misunderstood. That\u2019s a dead giveaway."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I don\u2019t think you can put a number on how much one person likes another."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay we\u2019ve got the cipher decoded."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Here you go guys let me get you going with some water. You need menus or you know what you want?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What I\u2019m doing here is trying to determine when I\u2019m going to die."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Why not?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So what package are you thinking?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Ouch."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay then why is a summons for a traffic violation committed in your car bearing your license plates coming to me?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No thanks. I\u2019m good."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Something terrible in a former life? I don\u2019t know."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going with this but tread carefully because it may be the last conversation we ever have."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh yeah? Well\u2026 you\u2019re a mean person."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"About halfway between Bruce Wayne and Scrooge McDuck."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yours."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well lots of scientists believe in God. Okay? Newton uh Faraday uh Pascal all were believers. Even Einstein was famous for attacking quantum theory on the grounds that God does not play dice with the universe."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay. I\u2019ll give it a shot. "},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well yeah Stuart thrives under pressure that\u2019s why he works in a comic book store."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I had no idea tortilla chips were such a good fuel source."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Of course not. Look at her."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Ah. Well your hair looks very nice."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah I used coconut shavings to do the hair on his feet. If you need to void your bladder before eating I can keep them warm with this beret that I thoroughly laundered and pressed into service as a pancake cosy."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"By the way if it should ever come up you didn\u2019t join us because you stuffed yourself with a chicken carbonara sub at Quizznos."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay here they come."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I am getting too old for this crud."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah you guys never use that space up there. Why not get a table?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh stop it. I\u2019ve seen you eat like a million hamburgers."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Alright thank you and Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t have a loofah."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"To the bar to sterilize my mouth with alcohol. Gang way! Dead man walking!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What are you doing?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Sad."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No that\u2019s okay. It was something else keeping me up last night. And again this morning. And I didn\u2019t mind. I was up last night. I was up this morning. I didn\u2019t mind. Those are your clues."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"We\u2019re not kicking him out. Stuart and I have become good friends."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I can\u2019t blame you. Tiny Twister was a complete bust."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yup. Bye."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I think it could be romantic. You know my parents met at his place of work."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hmm. I\u2019m gonna give you the same advice I yell at the TV when the Bachelor\u2019s handing out roses. Follow your heart."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh I just cannot believe you\u2019re here."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Maybe we can go up to Napa Valley. They\u2019ve got that wine train."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Good I\u2019m glad."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Do you think Penny will come here and take care of us?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You\u2019re nervous? I\u2019ve been stress-eating for four days. Look at me. I\u2019m wearing my fat pants."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Are you experiencing dehydration headache nausea and shame?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I\u2019ll see you around."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Because I don\u2019t feel good flirting with doctors for sales. I mean I know I make a lot of money. But I haven\u2019t been happy for a while."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You know maybe she\u2019d be more comfortable meeting a girl first."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Good-bye Emily. That was rough you guys."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Bees talk to each other by dancing. Whales have their songs."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay thanks."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It was. I asked her if she thought I should watch The Flash."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well have you slept with her yet? You dog! Good for you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay sweetie this started out fun but I\u2019m over it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey sweetie why don\u2019t you take a break and do something else for a while?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"But none of you know what this is like. Being celebrated for something you wish you never did."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No I was going to but she called in sick. And guess who else called in sick."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey how go the wedding plans Howard?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sisters?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Baseball."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s from Game of Thrones. What do you think?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well that\u2019s not good. You being blindly infatuated with me was the rock we were building this relationship on."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh my God. You\u2019re loving this."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Just the hits.  Where it\u2019s dark as a dungeon and it\u2019s damp as the dew."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Holy crap!  Holy crap!"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Do uh Howard and Bernadette know? Or is it like a possum in the walls kind of thing?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Uh Sheldon there are two dumplings left. Do you want them?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Stuart? Are you okay?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And how much profit do you make per Penny Blossom?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard if that Swedish team beats us I will never be able to enjoy anything from their country again. Which is a shame because Swedish meatballs are my favourite toothpick-delivered meatball."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Gelatinous Sphere."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon that wasn\u2019t for you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019ve been told it\u2019s a good way to move on."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh no no I get a say in it. But I\u2019m sure whoever shows up will be better company than a threesome I\u2019ve been having with Aunt Jemima and Mrs Butterworth."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"The sound is cutting out. I can\u2019t read that. The video is failing."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Ba-dum-bump."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Apples and oranges here Sheldon. I\u2019m telling you that girl is a user iceskating through the life on her looks taking advantage of innocent weak-willed men getting auditions for stupid network shows. It creams my corn."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wait a minute why am I doing all the giving here? If Leonard\u2019s really my friend why doesn\u2019t he have to support me in my hatred of Leslie Winkle?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I can\u2019t believe your attitude. I thought you were in favour of gay people getting married."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Fascinating. What\u2019s in it?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey Stuart."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay well it was pleasant seeing you other than that business with my testicles. "},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No he blew up the Death Star. Why do I know this?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Are you drinking whisky?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Penny after all these years I still feel like maybe I don\u2019t deserve you."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Uh you were in the building you were at the university then you were somewhere on Colorado Boulevard."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay my turn. Let me talk to him."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Howard relax I\u2019m not interested in your girlfriend."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And there\u2019s your answer."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s amazing."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Your hair is different. You changed your hair. I can\u2019t take this. I\u2019m out."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m in love. Let\u2019s do something else."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Really? I just made it up. Have you seen Slumdog Millionaire?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"How can I be okay? I come from a broken home."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay good night sweetie."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"He\u2019s right. And given that you\u2019re probably still waiting to be picked for a game that was played in fifth grade I\u2019m sure you do suck."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That\u2019s not bad Howard \u201cRocket Man\u201d Wolowitz."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"By taking away my only claim to fame? Well if you wanted to make me happy you could have told me a joke. Or shown me a cute video of a koala and an otter becoming unlikely friends."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What do you want Barry?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well I don\u2019t sell my friendship that cheaply."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Wait my laptop. "},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You\u2019re still awake?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey is that one of the new shirts Priya got you?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Irony\u2019s not really my strong suit. But I have been getting better with sarcasm if you want to give that a try."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Howard? Howard? It\u2019s me it\u2019s just me."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hmm. I\u2019m doing okay and I was very popular at 13."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It\u2019s like we both had these holes in our lives but now we fill each other\u2019s holes."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"That\u2019s nothing dude. Go check out how hung Florida is."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You and I have a standing TV schedule which is the result of extensive debate and compromise. Any alterations except for breaking news have to be pre-approved at the weekly roommate meeting."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"There we go."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You must be burning up."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You invited her to lunch four years ago. Everything about her is on you you make it so!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No. No."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s not a big deal. We have latex gloves."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What are you kidding? You\u2019re a semi-pro."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Scotty was on the original series and we\u2019re Next Generation. So joke\u2019s on you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah there\u2019s Fisherman\u2019s Wharf and Alcatraz and cable cars. We\u2019re gonna have so much fun."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Never mind. Okay if I watch some TV?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well we were being honest. You would leave me out of the conversation with the next guy if you dumped Leonard?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard we should probably have our story straight in case we get caught."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So what are you thinking for dinner?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"On Caprica night?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard? Have you ever noticed that only my name is on the cable bill?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m just saying it felt like it may have meant something."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What? Uh he\u2019ll be fine the guy\u2019s a trouper come here."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Considering what? How great this place looks?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Archimedes would be so proud."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Why would it trouble you? It\u2019s like your third favourite cartoon theme song."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s from Avatar World of Warcraft takes place in Azeroth. Goodness gracious how are you allowed to carry a gun? Can you at least refer me to a rogue ex-cop?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"And I really can\u2019t let that happen or the girl who does my eyebrows will think I\u2019ve been cheating on her."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay great you can tell him you hate him. Sign here."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"We\u2019re having a conversation about probing the heinies of superheroes. There are no stupid questions."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Plenty of time for you to meet another geriatric boy toy."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Fine I\u2019ll go over there tomorrow."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I wasn\u2019t speaking about me. I mean honestly there\u2019s no telling what will set you off. You know introducing myself as your boyfriend. Giving you the opportunity to drive me home. Breaking the ice with your colleagues using ethnic humour the funniest kind of humour."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well we\u2019ll be in the woods."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Wow. That is a lot of whereupons."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yeah of course. We have no secrets."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Great. You know this is how Anything Can Happen Thursday turns into It Won\u2019t Stop Coming Up Friday."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You went on a date last night? Are you seeing someone?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I lied. I love them. I only said that so you\u2019d go out with me."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I would have included the others but you know exactly what would\u2019ve happened. They would\u2019ve taken over the project and bossed us around."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"We locked eyes I ran to my room and we never ever spoke of it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Doubleazinga! I do! Good luck following that."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Nice try. Now Element Lad\u2019s ability is the power to transmute chemical elements. Helium has an atomic number of two. If you multiply that by the atomic number of N nitrogen you get 14 which is the atomic number of? I\u2019m just funnin\u2019 you silicon. And that is the most common element in the Earth\u2019s surface. So that narrowed it down to the geology lab or the chemistry lab."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Good. I\u2019ll leave you to your night time ablutions. I\u2019ve e-mailed you the morning bathroom schedule. You\u2019ll also find a laminated copy in your welcome packet. It\u2019s on the back of the emergency escape route diagram."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"How can you not be happy? You\u2019re tall thin and famous. Oh my God I\u2019m jealous of Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Will you stop it. This is a classroom. This is not American Bandstand."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t know. I just got back."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You can\u2019t let this stop you. Almost any scientific advancement can be used for destructive purposes."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"That is so awesome."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well done Leonard. The true hero doesn\u2019t seek adulation he fights for right and justice simply because it\u2019s his nature."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hello I\u2019m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Before we get started I\u2019d like to announce the winner of our design your own flag competition. But I can\u2019t. The only entry was from GameyGamer75 and I know that was a jpeg of your buttocks. Now this week we have a very special episode where we explore the flags of the popular entertainment franchise Star Trek. And to help me I\u2019m pleased to introduce Internet personality former star of Star Trek The Next Generation and the only guy I know lucky enough to be immortalized in one sixteenth scale. Set phasers to fun for my friend Wil Wheaton."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Only if you\u2019re this jellyfish which periodically reverts to a mass of undifferentiated protoplasm."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Darn. If you weren\u2019t busy I\u2019d ask you to join us."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Sheldon?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wha??"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well I\u2019m not using my nipples either. Maybe they should reassign those."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You okay?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No there\u2019s a difference between being stupid and acting stupid."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I\u2019ll call 911. What oh no my phone is in my other pants."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No no I\u2019m not so great. You\u2019ve got plans doing something you like I\u2019ve got plans doing something I like so it\u2019s good."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah let\u2019s see money women technology okay we\u2019re agreed our new friend is going to be Iron Man."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Are they working on that?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sounds good."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Good night."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"My phone\u2019s on the desk over there. Take a picture of us together. Make it good enough to go on a mug a mouse pad and a calendar. If you were a dove I\u2019d call you Lovey-Dovey. Oh. Who am I kidding? This isn\u2019t a moment for strict adherence to the literal. You\u2019re just my little Lovey-Dovey aren\u2019t you?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Excuse me. You\u2019re not supposed to be enjoying this."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s called ornithophobia. And someday it will be recognized as a true disability and the landlord will be required by law to put a giant net over the building. Which is unfortunate because I have a fear of nets."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon you\u2019re not in charge. It\u2019s my idea. I\u2019m in charge."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh dear Lord. No!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah no I meant plans to find some place to live. Other than with me not that I don\u2019t love having you but it\u2019s\u2026 a little crowded."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Of course that\u2019s how you know it\u2019s a good joke. It not only entertains it informs."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"A mistake involving Penny? Okay you\u2019ll have to narrow it down."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sure."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Penny just to save you from further awkwardness know that I\u2019m perfectly comfortable with the two of us climbing the stairs in silence."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Screw that! I sat on the floor for seven years. I\u2019m staying right here."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Did she think you were choking or\u2026 I\u2019m sorry that\u2019s great. Thank you for spending time with her."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Put on some headphones."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Great idea."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh. This entire endeavour seems to have been an exercise in futility. Raj you\u2019re back in. He likes monkeys."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I was going to say sad. I don\u2019t know why I hedged."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"So Penny I understand you would like to learn more about flags."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh careful. You\u2019re poking at the whole foundation of The Bachelor."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Um here\u2019s the thing.  Penny. Just as Oppenheimer came to regret his contributions to the first atomic bomb so too I regret my participation in what was at the very least an error in judgement. The hallmark of the great human experiment is the willingness to recognise one\u2019s mistakes. Some mistakes such as Madame Curie\u2019s discovery of Radium turned out to have great scientific potential even though she would later die a slow painful death from radiation poisoning. Another example from the field of ebola research\u2026."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"And we\u2019ve been busy with our paper."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Are you suggesting I play dirty?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Calm down okay? Try not to think about it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Amy I didn\u2019t want it to come to this but you have left me no choice but to employ the most passionate seductive dance known to man. The flamenco."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019ll give it a shot."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I don\u2019t know. If I want to watch old people sweat I can just FaceTime my family in India."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh please. If I wanted to take up a fad I\u2019d get a tramp stamp."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"When?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah okay no."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Baloney okay? You two are as afraid of hurting someone\u2019s feelings as I am."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Mutual indemnification always is. Why don\u2019t you start perusing while I set up my notary stamp."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Nope. It\u2019s exactly as lousy as advertised. Speaking of friends they have been asking to meet you. I was thinking maybe we could all hang out sometime?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Thanks."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You know what? I think it\u2019s a little weird that you remember me saying all these things. Maybe the truth is you\u2019re jealous of all my relationships."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Howard\u2019s disturbing recollections aside I don\u2019t appreciate being forced to do banal committee work."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh yeah. There\u2019s a reason he\u2019s Sir Elton John. They don\u2019t make you a knight for writing Wake Me Up Before You Go Go."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Unlikely but it could be a dwarf planet."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Why? What\u2019s the problem?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Maybe Howard and Bernadette said I could be here."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Photographic is a misnomer.

Offer\u2019s off the table."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I got to tell you we\u2019ve got to stop beating ourselves up like this. Excuse me everybody. Can I have your attention please? We\u2019re all here tonight because we have no one to be with. But that doesn\u2019t make us mutants. The only mutants here are in these comic books. We\u2019ve got to stop defining our self-worth by whether or not we\u2019re in a relationship. You know what I see when I look around? I see a room full of great people. So let\u2019s give ourselves a break. We are a community and as long as we have each other we\u2019re never truly alone."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Ah I\u2019m back you got me for eight minutes."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"All right what\u2019s going on?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I bought you and Bernadette a gravy boat worth eighty-eight dollars.

What\u2019s your name?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"But if I don\u2019t eat my lima beans I can\u2019t have my cookie."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"To help you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh the reverse psychology thing. I see. That\u2019s very clever."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Pantsuits suck."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey the future they show in Back to the Future II is only a year away. A lot of the things in that movie haven\u2019t been invented yet."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah you\u2019re right. That is the term I\u2019m looking for. You are a dirty double mother suckler."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Captain what are your orders?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You know what? That may be it.

Even in church."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So what do you think?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"More Halloween candy? Didn\u2019t you just buy a bunch of it yesterday?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Just tell her what I\u2019m really like. And if you think it\u2019ll help that you saw me changing once and my package reminded you of the muscular tail of a jaguar. Use your own words."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh I wish I could but I realized I\u2019ve become too emotionally vulnerable so like an operating system I\u2019m restoring my life to the last stable version which was in 2003 the day before I met Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Uh do you know how I solved the balanced centre combat-area problem? Five words transitional quadrilateral to triangular tessellation."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I called Leonard because I failed. And I didn\u2019t want you to think less of me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"She didn\u2019t dump me. It was mutual!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Beverly pointed out that I\u2019m experiencing insecurities in my relationship with Amy in the same way that Leonard and Penny are in their relationship."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Look you\u2019ve got to meet me halfway here."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"We\u2019re not home right now."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah birthday party first. Pity party later."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay glasses off. Find Waldo."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh God!

And then one day she meets a group of geniuses and their friend Howard."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Play that funky music white boy."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yup."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well it almost happened when you called my apple pie crust doughy but the truth is you were right and I was just angry at myself."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thank-you. We\u2019ll be right back."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"There are some charts in the back where I kept track of shape colour and consistency."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s not always because they die. In one case it\u2019s because they\u2019ve become involved with underground tree people from the dawn of time. Yeah but I won\u2019t say who it is. It\u2019s Brann."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Penny I\u2019m a physicist.

If I could I would run each and every one of you viewers up a flagpole and salute you. And if you touched the ground burn you. I\u2019d like to take a moment to personally thank Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler who you may or may not know is the first woman to co-host a flag or banner-related Internet info-tainment show."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Face it dude Bernadette treats you the same way your mother used to and that was not a healthy relationship."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Where are you going?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sure."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Interesting. You\u2019re suggesting that we recreate the conditions of the mine to see if we can handle it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Great."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Last night was Wednesday. Wednesday is comic book night. Tonight we\u2019ll be going on Thursday because it\u2019s Anything Can Happen Thursday."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And I\u2019m sorry.

Because look."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m Skippy. Skippy Cavanaugh."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You know what I\u2019m being ridiculous.

It just wasn\u2019t particularly helpful."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Wait wait wait how is my day-old marriage falling apart becoming about you two?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh Leonard is it really necessary to caption the obvious?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh cool it tells you when someone\u2019s reading your profile. Jenny309. I hope that\u2019s not her weight."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah me neither. It should be about the work.

She knows that I don\u2019t like Christmas and yet every year she forces me to celebrate it. Not only am I going to this foolish dinner against my will at the Christmas tree lot there was mistletoe and she kissed me under it in public. Like we were the stars of a Tijuana sex show."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"They asked me to come in."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh uh never have I ever thrown caught or touched a Frisbee."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah. Okay. Stop ruining Valentine\u2019s Day and order my pizza."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"But you charged me hundreds for this stuff."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yes but I get car sick too so\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Tests.

Who\u2019s up for this? "},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay so we\u2019ve got um three briskets four meatloafs one lasagna."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m curious about the whole social construct. On its face the idea of satisfying ones sexual appetite assuming one is afflicted with such without emotional entanglement that seems eminently practical. What I\u2019ve observed however is Howard Wolowitz crying like a little girl."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Aw you picked up on that huh?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wonderful Longclaw is mine. And how about you keep our avocado plant?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well where would you go?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re welcome Dr. Hofstadter."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Please you might as well have been two iguana with no dewlap enlargement."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yo Raj talk to me.

Okay I\u2019ll be honest with you. I\u2019ve just spent the last two hours imagining various scenarios in my head trying to come up with some clever line to say to you. But then I finally realized you\u2019re a human being; I\u2019m a human being. I could just say to you\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"My God when he\u2019s on the table and they use the paddles on him."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Very well."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Would you stop? Look he just moved here from London okay? He doesn\u2019t really know anybody."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I don\u2019t even know why I care. I don\u2019t care. All right I cared enough to memorize that stupid joke but that\u2019s all I care."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"So stipulated."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"By playing tic-tac-toe?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother\u2019s Day."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"And plus you got a rapid prototyper. That\u2019s an expensive piece of equipment dude."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard I am a published theoretical physicist with two doctorates and an IQ which can\u2019t be accurately measured by normal tests how much scarcer could I be?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You know I\u2019ve already got a gorgeous blonde back home at I can\u2019t score with. I think I\u2019ll let you two take this one."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t know Howard isn\u2019t really the family fun kind of guy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You saw through that one did you?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Thank you. Do you want to be on my team?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well maybe. But I\u2019m still glad we did it. I do feel closer to you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t. Teams are traditionally named after fierce creatures thus intimidating ones opponent."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No it is. Does he stay? Do they kiss? Does she find out about Montana?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Would you like to play a driving game I invented?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"How can she when you beat around the bush. She\u2019s from the mean streets where they shoot from the hip and keep it real."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Everything\u2019s fine. We just started talking about living arrangements."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Does it bother you?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"We\u2019re not selling his tomatoes on eBay."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Penny you know I\u2019m lactose intolerant."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It\u2019s a Christmas miracle."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay. Sheldon let me ask you a question."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Or maybe now that I\u2019m no longer an out-of-work actress who can\u2019t pay for her own dinner that makes you a little insecure."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well you sound like one now. I don\u2019t see the big deal if my brother comes and stays for a while."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So uh Priya what are your plans while you\u2019re here."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I didn\u2019t ask you to set me up with Lakshmi."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Thank you but it doesn\u2019t look like I\u2019m going to Comic-Con this year."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Will Wil want it?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"The telephone. You know Leonard in your own simple way you may be the wisest of us all. Voice mail. Curiouser and curiouser."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Do people like money? Is that what you\u2019re asking?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"We Indians invented them. You\u2019re welcome."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Bad news the Nigerian prince may be a fraud."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I\u2019m very happy you were able to hang out tonight."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Tomorrow."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Headaches dizziness and nausea."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Shut up. You know what I\u2019ve been doing for the last hour?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh. Well that\u2019s all right. There were plenty of ways to pass the time before smart phones were invented."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Uh you\u2019re sad about not getting anything done last night so you\u2019re gonna sit around and pout about it?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh wow."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well I had just begun puberty. It was figuratively and literally one of the hairiest moments of my life."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"See this right here what you\u2019re doing can you please not do that around Sheldon\u2019s mom?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You know Sheldon if we apply to be one of those teams we could be on the ground floor of something big not just for theoretical physics but for astrophysics as well."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay now I just need to make sure I have a Lalita before I meet the grasshopper. It\u2019s a sweet green miracle."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s awful. This morning she arranged for me to be an Amtrak junior conductor for the day. It it\u2019s usually only open to children. She got them to make an exception."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay just put it on my calendar but start thinking of a reason why I can\u2019t go alrighty? Koothrappali out. God bless that boy I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without him."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No. I did have a shot with the Lisatronic but the extension cord wasn\u2019t long enough."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You say thank you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hey! He did that on purpose"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"The fun thing about Prince Joey is every time he moves there\u2019s a one-in-five chance he\u2019ll kill himself."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay if I upset you then why didn\u2019t you just say something?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well whether you see it or not is irrelevant. I can\u2019t see subatomic particles but nevertheless they\u2019re there."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Excuse me. I\u2019m going to go wander the streets alone. Invisible unwanted and unloved a pathetic shadow in a city with no heart.  I forgot my windbreaker. It\u2019s chilly."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh I believe that was something else I wasn\u2019t supposed to mention."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Zzz-zz-zz-zz! Second of all the door to the stairwell of the other building was locked so I had to go down the fire escape which ends on the third floor forcing me to crawl through the window of a lovely Armenian family who insisted I stay for lunch."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No I\u2019m just allergic to people who get Nobel Prizes for no good reason."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh yay for me. What about you guys? I can\u2019t promise anything but people do make money off stuff like this."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Ah I\u2019m making a necklace for my mom."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Not so good."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Can I use your phone? Our car got stolen."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"That\u2019s the saddest thing I\u2019ve ever heard."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"37 minutes left until the deadline."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon we still have 380 of these things to make."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey honey."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re obviously good at what you do."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Just being the unsocialised eccentric my mother always thought I was."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh just let me look. Oh my goodness. I see quivering black lines. Those must be neurons oh they\u2019re so thick and beautiful."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh okay well guess I\u2019m your new neighbour Penny."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"No no. After we got undressed and jumped in bed you you asked if I had protection."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You\u2019re right I really should be asking strangers on the Internet."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"There\u2019s only 30 seconds left in the auction."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Not great. Can I talk to you for a sec?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Amy."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Great."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey buddy."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I mean really what\u2019s so great about being grown up?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Sorry. Walking tree."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Speaking of love STDs among the elderly are skyrocketing."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Why are you sitting in the stairwell?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"On the other hand that low-down polecat done wronged my woman."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well we should call her."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You actually put that in an agreement?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"That works."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"But we haven\u2019t finished the puzzle."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What do you got?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Of course I\u2019m sure. Look at the beta-function of quantum chrono-dynamics the sign\u2019s been changed."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well what happened with your dad?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You know I heard of this way of watching the movies called the Machete Order where you watch Episodes IV and V then skip Episode I watch II and III as a flashback and then finish with VI."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I like it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So Sheldon how you doing?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Mm it\u2019s hard to say. I can only speculate based on the data I collected watching my parents\u2019 marriage implode. In that case the woman dives into religion while the man dives into a bottle-blonde bartender who tries to buy my love with action figures. Oop! Out of arrows."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Before you do please give me one more chance to apologize to Emily."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"And of course Mom."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No. I actually felt kinda silly just saying on the down-low."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You\u2019re not curious who she\u2019s out with?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey did you ever make it to the dentist?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You don\u2019t honestly think that do you?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Except this is totally about my mom."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wait a question who decides if someone\u2019s gone off topic?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"\u2018Cause that\u2019s what little matzo balls do."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"From the future? How fun and imaginative."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"C3PO."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Wow you just don\u2019t get it do you? Buying me something pretty isn\u2019t going to make our problem just go away."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sure we could write something up."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon you do this all the time. You fixate on some crazy idea and then blow it way out of proportion."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well I can do without the 40-minute car ride where she criticizes every aspect of my life."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah I know I still can\u2019t afford it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So you\u2019ll send him an e-mail when we get back."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What are negs?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Of course you will. It\u2019s impossible to pay me back sooner than you can. Assuming you subscribe to a linear understanding of time and causality."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah. It\u2019s a deviated septum. The surgery to correct it is simple. He\u2019s gonna do it next week."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh I know I\u2019m going to regret this but what trauma?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"May I ask what this is about?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Except in Knight Rider the car isn\u2019t a yammering sphincter."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Look we admit it. The idea that you guys came up with was really good and I\u2019d love your help."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh you seem extra happy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah shut up Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah. And I\u2019m a little worried because things between us have been so great and I\u2019d hate to do anything that screws that up."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Aw how nice. Well a space opened up at the last minute on the NSF expedition to the Arctic Circle."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"And that\u2019s based on the inherent credit-worthiness of people who get drunk and urinate on police vehicles?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Maybe."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No. What you see is a man trembling with confidence. Does a locus coeruleus normally bleed that much?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You mean the strong sexy angel I can\u2019t stop thinking about? Who can say?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"All that and he\u2019s shorter than me."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Sticks and stones may break my bones but chairs on sticks are comfy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Thank you Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Why would I change?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What do you want?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m looking for a barber and I\u2019m running out of time. My hair is growing at the rate of 4.6 yoctometers per femtosecond. I mean if you\u2019re quiet you can hear it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well that\u2019s always been a secret. Not even Amy knows."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Uh Stuart I was wondering if you could help me find something."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I get it. Smallville almost wrecked you."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"There are no solar flares right now."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I really can\u2019t thank you enough for taking me in.

That\u2019s Anais none of the other girls in the house like her."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Not some kind of nerd I am the king of the nerds."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Sounds about right."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What are you saying that I\u2019m threatened by Alicia? That I\u2019m like the old queen of the hive and it\u2019s just time for me to go?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"If you want help just hire a grad student."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey that\u2019s good. Why\u2019d you guys stop doing that?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And the answer was Zack correct?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Uh Lucy\u2019s coming over. I need some advice."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I feel like I pulled something. Why didn\u2019t you tell me to stop?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I cannot believe you guys aren\u2019t going to play with these."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Correct."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh uh you know because we\u2019re friends."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hmm. Yes. Look at him Amy. It\u2019s such a shame. Struck down in the prime of my life."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I I\u2019m fine."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Good night."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Uh uh I couldn\u2019t help but notice that you cut the line."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re too late."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh they went to the store to get solder which is metal you melt to make science things."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"That\u2019s my joke. I told it last night. You can\u2019t just use it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon you don\u2019t give your mother enough credit. She\u2019s warm she\u2019s loving she doesn\u2019t glue electrodes to your head to measure your brain waves while potty training."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Did your boyfriend make you type that?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Mmmm."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah just a heads-up on the car window deal. It helps but everything is not peachy."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh that\u2019s nice. Most people her age don\u2019t embrace technology."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Monday morning I\u2019ll go downtown look up the owner\u2019s information and send him the DVD. Pay the late fee and prove to Sheldon that you can have a problem and solve it without acting like a complete lunatic. Ah!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well what passes for science on dating sites. They claim to use heuristic algorithms but it may well be hokum."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t know two three days. Not important. I don\u2019t need sleep I need answers. I need to determine where in this swamp of unbalanced formulas squatteth the toad of truth."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And you\u2019re frustrated because he phrased his reply in the form of a meaningless tautology?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That would be great. Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No I mean since the Shamy hit a reef."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"If I can interject again. Leonard comes from a remarkably high-achieving family who have all chosen high-achieving partners. He probably feels that it\u2019s doubtful that his mother will be overly impressed with his dating a woman whose most significant achievement is memorizing the Cheesecake Factory menu."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey guys. Enjoying your food that I actually brought you instead of promising food but bringing you a box of random crap?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sure sure just I don\u2019t know much about football."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"It\u2019s just since we got married you seem to think you don\u2019t have to try any more."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard would you be a lamb?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"And now you see the problem."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well this is ridiculous. Being upset about Amy all the time isn\u2019t accomplishing anything. If I want to resolve this situation then I need to take action."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well so far I\u2019ve come up with three ideas. The first is a chance for her to play the harp with the L.A. Philharmonic."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What does your agent think?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Wesley Crusher was Wil Wheaton\u2019s character on Star Trek."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You know I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s unpleasant when they\u2019re sick. When Penny got food poisoning she threw up so loudly I could barely hear the television."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Obviously not a cleaning business."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"We could go up to Big Bear and get a house on the lake."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So what are you guys gonna do today?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Not likely. KoKo learned to understand over 2000 words not one of which had anything to do with shoes."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon what do you think you\u2019re doing?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well tell you one thing if I ever do get married no Klingon invitations."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You still want to get married right?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Why? What are you afraid of?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Overdo what? Happiness? Freedom? This warm glow inside of me that promises everything is going to be all hunky donkey?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"We all do. Now how about dinner?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah but why didn\u2019t you go back to your apartment?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah it must have been. I just threw up in my closet."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So it\u2019s a family film."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No no this is a slippery slope Leonard. It starts with a parking space where does it end? It\u2019s like my dad always said first they say you can\u2019t drink and drive next thing you know you can\u2019t let your 10-year-old take the wheel while you sleep one off in the backseat."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I don\u2019t understand."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well you have a brown fleck in your right iris that looks like a Formula One race car. So I\u2019m just concentrating on that. Plus it\u2019s easier around people that I\u2019m comfortable with."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"No thanks."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Um okay. Can I ask you a favour."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay everybody. Who\u2019s ready for a scavenger hunt?  each each puzzle will lead you to the location of the next the last of which will lead you to the coin. The first team that finds it wins."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What\u2019s the first one?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I haven\u2019t had sex in a year."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I wasn\u2019t gonna get beat up."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You had a panic attack when we went through the car wash."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s fine. You win."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Nothing you\u2019re perfect."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Thank you for the clarification."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No I can\u2019t. This isn\u2019t right."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"But theoretically if you and I were in a gay relationship how would we tell people? Like print up announcements?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Mm-hmm. Hey want to get a little crazy?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s not optional. We\u2019re out of tea. I hope you like bouillon."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"She made the case that if we break down in the middle of nowhere your Nebraska backwoods skills and brawny hands will give us the best chance to survive in the wild."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Stop fighting me on the premise. It\u2019s scientifically valid. I\u2019m going to advance propositions I just want you to challenge me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What are you doing?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You promised Penny what?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No I do not. You are a mean little man."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I miss the old days when your romantic partners could be returned to the video store."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"She claimed to be alone when there was obviously someone else in her apartment. I have no choice but to assume the worst given Leonard\u2019s lengthy sea voyage and her famously ravenous nether regions."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Why would I? That\u2019s where all the cool trains are."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh we are bad boys aren\u2019t we?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh my God Kenny G? This woman can read me like a book. I can\u2019t believe I bought my soul mate at Glendale Galleria."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You were supposed to keep that to yourself."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Been there."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Wow. It\u2019s an antique sextant. Sailors used these to find their position by the stars."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I can\u2019t tell you that."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I want to thank you all for coming on such short notice. Uh in the past I\u2019ve reached out to each of you individually but I believe my present situation requires the collective wisdom of the group which as you can see from your commemorative T-shirts I have dubbed Sheldon Cooper\u2019s Council of Ladies."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I got the results back. Have you developed any of the following symptoms? A growing nose or perhaps a warm sensation in the trouser region? Also known as full-blown liar liar pants on fire."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Dude I\u2019m a single man. Saturday night is my party night."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah. That\u2019s not what I had in mind."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What if he doesn\u2019t?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"As if Valentine\u2019s Day wasn\u2019t bad enough you try to kill my dog? And with cheap chocolate no less?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Because you don\u2019t have a girlfriend? Well good Lord if that becomes a reason not to play Dungeons and Dragons this game\u2019s in serious trouble."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"How was I supposed to know that?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":" Penny."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Maintaining five friendships promises to be a Herculean task. So I\u2019m going to have to let one of you go."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No you don\u2019t. Oh hey what\u2019s Sheldon supposed to be."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I was enjoying some virtual reality until you ruined it with your actual face."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"All right Howard Wolowitz listen up. You sign anything she puts in front of you because you are the luckiest man alive. If you let her go there is no way you can find anyone else. Speaking on behalf of all women it is not gonna happen we had a meeting. And you a grown man fainting at the sight of a little blood."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"That\u2019s what you took from that? The guy is married!"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Why not? With online shopping and overnight delivery I can get anything I want. Look I just ordered a case of Dinty Moore beef stew and two live lobsters on Amazon."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay so once we receive the next image and compare it to the ones we\u2019ve already collected we\u2019ll know what it is that we found."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Mmm in a way. We presented papers and then broke off into focus groups and critiqued each other."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What are you doing?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"For goodness\u2019 sake he\u2019s wearing a hat glasses and a red striped shirt."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Celebrate your thirty under thirty thing. Right Sheldon? "},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I know but you did it. I\u2019m so proud of you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Gentlemen. ."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll still love him."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Is she suggesting what I think she\u2019s suggesting?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019ll help you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Over the years here at Fun With Flags we\u2019ve had an opportunity to learn laugh wonder."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You know Penny we make such a good team maybe we could enter a couple of Halo tournaments sometime."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I know."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Do not tell me about my own culture Sheldon! In the mood I\u2019m in I\u2019ll take you out I swear to cow!"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well that seems fair."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"My plan is to stop at malls and buy what I need. It\u2019s called living off the land."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Not necessarily. I have four months to find some new friends."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I should hope so. That\u2019s from the first Spider-Man movie."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"If it helps you sleep then why are you sitting here staring at me like the albino boogeyman?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"If you\u2019re really a prostitute."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Just dandy Mr I-Wish-I-Was-Better-At-Improv."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Why do you read his Twitter feed? You know it\u2019s only going to upset you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Possibly."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"How can you call yourself a scientist and run out of solder?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well I had some of my best ideas in that room and I\u2019m sure you will too."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey I know it\u2019s none of my business but where did the money come from?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Good luck getting time on it. The only people he lets use it are his friends."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay fine what do you suggest?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay. First order of physics bowl business. We need a truly kick-ass team name. Suggestions."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh you\u2019re kidding me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well then apparently you hate fun."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Boy it\u2019s good to be back."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What are you doing?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Because if she hadn\u2019t she\u2019d still be wading through the list."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m not good with cold Leonard. How often have we had to leave a movie theatre because I got a headache from drinking the Icee too fast? I can\u2019t go."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah I\u2019m not quite sure how to respond."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thank you for coming back."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019ll show you how to do one."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You help me run my game."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"But it\u2019s a picture of you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re afraid of germs."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Nice save genius. Eggnog?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah you should have burned it down years ago."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"No no you\u2019re pregnant. The only thing you carry is our hope for a better tomorrow."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Somebody got the whole thing on a cell phone and put it on youtube."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey I already set up Howard and Bernadette. It\u2019s your turn to ruin some poor girl\u2019s life."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Can I at least have the upper GI? I already drank the barium!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So how\u2019s it going with Sheldon are you guys still not talking to each other?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Do you want lemonade?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I think it\u2019s Bert."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay okay how about this? We tell him somebody broke in."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t care what the symptoms are my girlfriend is not going to give you a prostate exam."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I have to return the helicopter. My father\u2026 What did you do?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You did flop around a lot."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Priya?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No it\u2019s a nitrogen laser. It\u2019ll cook your eyeball like a soft-boiled egg."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh it took me forever to get him on a bathroom schedule. He would just go whenever the mood struck him."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Do you really mean that?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"We\u2019re not wasting time with names right now."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Put it back in your pocket or I\u2019ll find some other place to put it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No. You\u2019re crazy about me."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You said it\u2019s a magic hammer."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh so many things. Her mind her kindness and especially her body."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"We pretend we\u2019re aliens. I\u2019m not the best at reading facial cues but I\u2019m gonna say that you love it and want to hear more. Now in the beloved novel Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy an alien named Ford Prefect pretended to be human in order to blend in so that he could write an entry about Earth for The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy which is a travel book within the actual book which is also called The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t know. What do you want to do?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"\u2018Cause if you\u2019re still upset about that we don\u2019t have to go."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That\u2019s funny. Boy I\u2019m gonna miss these painkillers."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"But you don\u2019t like other people."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh yes I I too am in the throes of heartbreak. Okay fine I\u2019ll tell you about it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I used to collect them as a child. The spiral of scales open in the Fibonacci sequence. A fact that when you tell your brother gets a golf ball thrown at your head."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"She didn\u2019t tell you?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well a lot of people can\u2019t. Uh hey."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard\u2019s asleep."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I do. And I wouldn\u2019t be able to forgive myself if something happened to him and I wasn\u2019t at his bedside to say I told you so."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It\u2019ll be okay."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well you should be. Because all I can think about is how much I want to kiss you. And not just on the cheek but on the mouth. Like mommies and daddies do."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"He loves you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"How about I tell her the painting makes you feel jealous because you\u2019re not in it?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wonderful. I just finished hanging the lights."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Why does it have to get weird?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wait. You were pretending?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Uh go ahead. Read it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Got it. So I\u2019m assuming nothing venereal. I\u2019ll just tell her that you had a routine colonoscopy and haven\u2019t quite bounced back."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"All right let\u2019s shoot stuff. You want me to show you what to do?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Eh it will be. Honestly if I must endure a long and tedious evening I\u2019d rather it be with you on date night. But I have no choice. The tenure committee\u2019s going to be there."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Not to mention Malibu Koothrappali and his totally bitchin\u2019 dream house."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m not glowing. I\u2019m upset."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Get them before they get us."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah I don\u2019t know Penny\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well so do I but don\u2019t you want to live with your wife and set the thermostat to whatever you want and have your body tell you when it\u2019s time to go to the bathroom you know not a schedule slipped underneath your door every morning?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Mmm."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yeah. Well if you want to march in a fishnet crop top you better lay off that dip."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well I guess it goes back to when I was a fat kid in India and didn\u2019t have any friends."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I can\u2019t. I\u2019m too sick. Go away."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t know what we were worried about they\u2019re getting along great."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Bert did quality research and he deserves whatever accolades he receives."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Great. I\u2019ll see you later. And remember he\u2019s more afraid of you than you are of him."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Aw."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah. Pretty cool huh?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard please. His mother just died."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"He got a cat to keep him company."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Wow that\u2019s rough. Where\u2019d you get that?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You see right through me don\u2019t you?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Come on Sheldon we\u2019re going to be late."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hey Stuart."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Excuse me can I say something? I just love both you guys and I want you to get along. And when I say love I meant as a friend. And uh way too soon right?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That\u2019s not helpful."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Excuse me this is a fairly substantial wound. "},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Why don\u2019t we go after your mother?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Amy deserves better. You know when we buy the Planter\u2019s deluxe mix she eats all the Brazil nuts so I don\u2019t have to look at them. She\u2019s a unique blend of saint and squirrel."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thankfully Penny and I have a relationship based on honesty. What? I don\u2019t lie to her."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right. This is a form indemnifying me from your use of Leonard\u2019s bedroom. Sign here indicating that I tried to stop you and did so using a stern facial expression."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Th-th-th-that\u2019s okay. I can infer from context."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No I\u2019m going to ask him to choose between sex and Halo 3. As far as I know sex has not been upgraded to include high-def graphics and enhanced weapon systems."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay explain something to me. You watch Leonard put up with that guy for years and years. What has to break inside your brain for you to think Oh Krishna I\u2019ve got to get me some of that?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Do you think they gave Wolverine an Adamantium prostate?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I would like to propose a salon topic."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah right on sister."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So Mother I\u2019m surprised you came all this way for Sheldon\u2019s birthday."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Aw look at you watching sports."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right. Leonard went to  the office."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wow no foreplay or anything just right to it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"She hit on me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh. You have other plans or\u2026?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well it turns out I had a little rocket fuel in the apartment."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"And how you threw up in zero gravity and it floated back in your mouth. And you threw up again. And so on and so on."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Of course. All we need is to find stuff to make a lever big enough to fix this."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I discovered a secret ingredient. The flavour packet. That sucker is well named. All right lover boy get ready \u2019cause there is a crap storm of romance coming your way."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Great."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I was going to do that."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Uh Lucy\u2019s coming over. I need some advice."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Why don\u2019t we go after your mother?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Bailment describes a relationship in common law where a physical possession of personal property or chattels is transferred from one person the bailor to another person the bailee."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Don\u2019t ruin it for me man. I printed out a PDF to read on the potty."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh yes. He says they are lost without you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay I\u2019m just gonna go home and make a grilled cheese and window-shop on eHarmony."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah but the ones in my pocket are mine."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Aha."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I didn\u2019t want to make this one."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"And where were you?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Can I say I ruined you for white men?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I hear what you\u2019re saying but I\u2019ve known Emily a long time and I think she deserves the benefit of the doubt."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh yeah well I\u2019ve already given this some thought and I\u2019m willing to let Penny live with us one day a week for a trial period. Now obviously not when she\u2019s made cranky by the shedding of her uterine lining."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I don\u2019t understand why you people just let him bully you like this. Someone should stand up to him. What\u2019s he going to do?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What about loop quantum gravity?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I earned this. Back off."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s smart because Sheldon 1 Amy 0."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"But I answered it\u2019s called teamwork."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah just a heads-up Penny knows that you blabbed about Leonard. She\u2019s pretty mad."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well how much you got in there?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Aah! And after I let you be Gary."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I think she means not a weirdo."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"See you later."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Intellectually about 30 hours. Emotionally about 29 years."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"So where should we do it?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So should we talk to each other or mingle?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t I know but this isn\u2019t a big deal. It\u2019s just a little savings I put aside."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You know maybe it won\u2019t be that bad. Leonard says it\u2019s really mainstream now. Comic books aren\u2019t just for sad nerds any more. I mean it is still a key part of their demographic."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Should\u2019ve punched that guy."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"So what\u2019s up?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh-huh."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No it\u2019s the wise man. That\u2019s why he\u2019s called the wise man. You know how I know that? I\u2019m the wise man."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well you know we\u2019re engaged and it\u2019s kind of a big deal financially. It seems like something we should talk about."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right. I\u2019ve devoted the prime of my life to string theory and its quest for the compactification of extra dimensions. I\u2019ve got nothing to show for it and I feel like a fool."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Can it wait until I put a Band-Aid on a goat bite?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey you got a minute?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"My mother asked me to get some towels.

Right?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well that approach has Sheldon Cooper written all over it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Fun? Mixing Dungeons and Dragons with Christmas is like making a sandwich of grape jelly the best-tasting jelly and petroleum jelly the worst-tasting jelly."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You think with your penis."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What the hell is wrong with you?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That\u2019s not necessary when someone\u2019s trying to help you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"New shirts?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"We appear to be at a crossroads in our relationship Mother."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah.

How can she have dinner?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well that is fine because I\u2019ve decided that I won\u2019t be joining you. I\u2019ve realized that the most genuine way to demonstrate the remorse I feel is to let you have this weekend to yourselves."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I know what your point is. You\u2019re intimidated by Amy\u2019s intellect. To that I say buck up."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes well he lied."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Some what?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Thank you but if I\u2019m gonna just take advantage of my friends I might as well keep on relying on my father."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"No I\u2019m mad at you. I hate myself but I\u2019m mad at you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah they say don\u2019t meet your heroes.

A guy who has your back."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"He\u2019s irony impaired just move on."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It\u2019s not creepy.

Our parents said so. We are for all intents and purposes one hundred percent hooked up."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re only saying that because you haven\u2019t been there.

Does Sheldon know you\u2019re sleeping in here?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It amazes me how you constantly obsess over fictional details when there are more important things in the real world to worry about.

You know there was a time I would say God bless you and then you would say if you must invoke an imaginary deity how about Thor? And I would say how do you know I didn\u2019t mean Thor? And then you would say Touch\u00e9 and that there ends the tale of why I no longer say"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s not that big of an opportunity. And even if Hawking\u2019s theories are correct all they prove is where the universe came from why everything exists and what its ultimate end will be. I mean me? I\u2019m interested in the big questions."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well conversations that you wouldn\u2019t be comfortable having in front of the opposite sex.

If you\u2019re not attracted to the suitor then the likelihood of conception would be reduced."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"The average cork speed is 25 miles per hour. If that is too fast around a school it is certainly too fast around a kitchen."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Why would he call me?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Who is he?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hah yeah! Because he didn\u2019t want Sheldon to be embarrassed and there is nothing to be embarrassed okay every family in America has a relative holed up in a garage somewhere huffing paint thinner."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It\u2019s true. I like my giant iPad and my little iPad almost as much as my regular-sized iPad."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No I\u2019m dry.

There\u2019s forward uh reverse set the brakes. Are you done yet? You\u2019re missing"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s a wise policy. I once borrowed my sister\u2019s makeup for a costume contest. Got a terrible case of pinkeye. But luckily I was going as a zombie. I won second place."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"My new computer came with Windows 7. Windows 7 is much more user-friendly than Windows Vista.

I mean I tried to be friends with Zack like you said which believe me was difficult given how you and me used to be you know you and me and now you and him are you and him."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"If you people think this is better than Tom Hanks-giving you\u2019re all crazy."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Guys they\u2019re gonna sell out."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Me neither.

I always thought if I had a white name it would be Gavin."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah he\u2019s over it that\u2019s why he\u2019s been whining all day about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from Men in Black."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Twenty feet twenty light years it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s in a galaxy far far away."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t know."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"It won\u2019t happen again what\u2019s up?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Where?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well excuse me I don\u2019t think Penny\u2019s out of line at all.

The simple fact is because I am much smarter than you and able to anticipate your actions it is highly unlikely that you two rubes could ever surprise me. "},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"How did that work out?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"She\u2019s not my friend. Friends do not get their friends care bears all sweaty."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"At the hot dog stand in the Denver train station Heinz ketchup. At the hot dog stand in the Salt Lake City train station Heinz ketchup. At the hot dog stand in the Indianapolis train station?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Then what happens?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"According to an online message board I may be having a panic attack. SoccerMom09 had similar symptoms. But to be fair the twins were a real handful that day."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh thanks you\u2019re a peach. Beverly we\u2019ll catch up soon. Bernadette it was a pleasure as always Penny you have spinach in your teeth."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m androgynous?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I just got called into President Siebert\u2019s office.

Or a dolphin I go back and forth."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No one\u2019s a scientist like Howard."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Good. Sheldon\u2019s out of town so we can do whatever we want. We even ordered from the Thai place he doesn\u2019t like."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You look like a jackass."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No he doesn\u2019t understand. I understand."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well answer it. I want to hear."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No you should. Absolutely. That was me being pedantic. That\u2019s our first bug. You reported it. I can fix that. See? This is good."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wait. Not yet. We still have to go over safety procedures. Now the apartment has three emergency exits located here here and here. In the event of a power outage luminous paint will guide you to the nearest exit."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019m not telling. I\u2019m from Asia. I\u2019m mysterious. Deal with it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Aw that\u2019s so weird."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well I can\u2019t take all the credit. It was pretty funny when that one anchovy started going the wrong way."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You\u2019re right.

This is about me having a place where I can open up about my feelings."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay then riddle me this. Assuming all the good Terminators were originally evil Terminators created by Skynet but then reprogrammed by the future John Connor why would Skynet an artificial computer intelligence bother to create a petite hot 17 year-old killer robot?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah I uh went for a drink."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Isabella."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"How ya doing?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well then why didn\u2019t you say that to her?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Would it help?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You\u2019re kidding why not?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What is wrong with you Penny?

The flag of the Isle of Man is nothing but three legs sharing a weird pair of underpants so you think you got problems."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh please if influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear it would have died out thousands of years ago. Somewhere between tool using and cave painting homo habilus would have figured out to kill the guy with the runny nose."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Dude my parents just split up."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What? Here give me give me. Oh my God. Oh my God they\u2019re coming right towards us."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No cilantro?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"So?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay so not her either.

I will melt her heart. And her face."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay. Shall we go to dinner?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"But I was summing up."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"When you tell this story later the word we usually use is quirky."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh okay let\u2019s pretend you do have a problem."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah it was. But it\u2019s my father\u2019s money and I\u2019m mad at him."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Ah don\u2019t. If they didn\u2019t want to be yelled at by crazy nerds they shouldn\u2019t have started a sci-fi channel."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Actually ethyl alcohol inhibits electrical conduction in the nerve cells and stimulates reuptake receptors of inhibitory neurotransmitters like gamma-aminobutyric acid."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"The glass is empty Sheldon. It\u2019s completely empty. If you gave that glass to a man who was dying of thirst he would be dead do you know why?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Congratulations. Zack how would you like to be Superman?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Please wait until I get into the hall."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":" Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Right right. So you\u2019re still just texting and emailing? You don\u2019t feel any need to hang out with her you know be in the same room?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"And we made it in only three hours. Sounds just like store-bought."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"The original title was \u201cA Rederivation of Maxwell\u2019s Equations Regarding Electromagnetism\u201d\u201d I dumbed it down because some of the more religious people in town were starting to say I was a witch."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh I\u2019m not buying anything. They\u2019re having a lecture. H-O gauge railroading. Half the size of O-gauge but twice the fun. Very controversial topic."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh that\u2019s great."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Just ignore him."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m not taking you anywhere till you put on a shirt."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Did you get a cold too?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You know why this hamburger surpasses the Big Boy? This is a single decker hamburger whereas the Big Boy is a double decker. This has a much more satisfying meat to bun to condiment ratio."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"He lied about the cream cheese. He ate the whole thing. I saw him."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So how do you want me to cut it?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh hey. Did you see that? I I figured out how to open the door all by myself. Maybe I\u2019ll fling some faeces around my cage to celebrate."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Cool. Can I say it fell apart because you were all I want to have your babies and I was like I\u2019m too rock and roll to be tied down?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No it\u2019s fine. Now I can devote all my time to dark matter."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Come on dude you\u2019re being too hard on yourself. You\u2019ve got a lot of good stuff going on."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh! I see the confusion here. No no Alex thought I was singling her out. No. I meant that all women are slaves to their biological urges you know? Even you. You\u2019re a slave."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Boy what I wouldn\u2019t give to get her out of those pants and into something a little more stylish."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I thought maybe after we eat we could see an early movie."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Bye."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Don\u2019t be absurd. That\u2019s in Washington. You know I could never live in a city whose streets are laid out in a wheel-and-spoke pattern. No. I\u2019m going to find a similarly menial job where my basal ganglia are occupied with a routine task freeing my prefrontal cortex to work quietly in the background on my problem."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Whatever I\u2019ll figure it out myself."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"She\u2019s not going to steal our idea."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It\u2019s not superstition. It\u2019s practically Newtonian. For every action there\u2019s an equal and opposite reaction. Leonard pretends to be a friend and acts like a two-faced bitch therefore he is reborn as a banana slug. It\u2019s actually a very elegant system you know what goes around comes around."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Good night Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yes he is."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Now that I know she doesn\u2019t like me I\u2019m kind of into her."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Chickens can\u2019t climb trees"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Was it the two women thing or the playa?

I suppose I should apologize to you as well."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Uh I\u2019m sorry do you speak English?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You know I felt the same way about the spork. Uh solids and liquids handled by one utensil? That\u2019ll never work. Spoiler works."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What brought that on?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It\u2019s called being nice."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well there are the waitresses at my work and this cute little shop in Old Town."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"She doesn\u2019t want to live with Leonard so he has to come live here again. She\u2019s the snake in our garden. She\u2019s the reason we can\u2019t be happy."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You know who\u2019s got to be the bravest person in the Marvel Universe? Whoever has to give She-Hulk a bikini wax."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m striking up a casual conversation with you. S\u2019u\u2019up?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You\u2019re really not gonna tell me?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That\u2019s a good question."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Ah okay.

Chocolate?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You just say uh Hey Siri what time is it?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You know if no one\u2019s thought of this yet this could be a big deal."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Gentlemen use your imagination. Innovate. Did Han Solo let Luke Skywalker freeze to death on the ice planet of Hoth? No. He cut open a tauntaun and used its internal body heat to warm him up."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Forget the robot. What happened to you?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What did they feed the lions Mother?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Uh off. And on. And the Oprah Network. This is so much better than watching TV like a muggle."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"If it\u2019s an alternate dimension sounds like a job for a landing party."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What the hell is this?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And people think I don\u2019t get sarcasm."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Except I\u2019ll be alone."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Look honey I was really drunk and made a huge mistake last night. We should\u2019ve never slept together. It\u2019s what ruins friendships."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hang on. Oh no. Oh no. Oh God no."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I say uh how about one two three go?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No he doesn\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well the colonel said it was for the good of the country and the funding is substantial."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Good. On the way to see the lawyer pick up some tea and cookies. I must say I am enjoying your new chair."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Shh! It\u2019s my agent it\u2019s my agent. You\u2019re kidding. Oh my gosh. I can\u2019t believe it! Really? Oh I\u2019m so excited thank you thank you so much. Okay bye. I got the haemorrhoid commercial! I start Monday."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hello."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well I\u2019m kind of responsible for Sheldon missing Stan Lee and I really want to make it up to him. So I was hoping you could give me his phone number so maybe I can arrange for them to meet."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I did shut up. Now you shut up."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Uh Xbox One."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m sorry who\u2019s Angie Dickinson?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What can we do?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"How\u2019s that?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"The guy who invented it says it\u2019s jif."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"And I wanted to make you feel better so I planned something very special for you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh right."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"And it would be my pleasure to be her num-num."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey are you still hanging out with Bernadette tonight?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Fine."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You keep talking like that you\u2019re gonna make colour guard."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Guys it\u2019s hot in here I think I\u2019ll just take off all my clothes."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t want it better. I want it my way."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Because it was crap. It\u2019s a sequel to that awful killer gorilla movie I was in."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Maybe it means something different in this country. Back in India it means you\u2019re upset with a guy named Howard!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well you know it\u2019s just that Leonard and Howard and Raj they aren\u2019t like other guys. They\u2019re special."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Damn it everyone\u2019s better at this than me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Can you go to the kitchen and get me the turkey baster labelled mucus."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Ooh it\u2019ll be like a reunion then. Sign here."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That is my spot. In an ever-changing world it is a single point of consistency. If my life were expressed as a function on a four-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system that spot at the moment I first sat on it would be zero-zero-zero-zero."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And that\u2019s how you make effort look effortless."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"He\u2019s right. A minute on the lips a lifetime on the hips."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Fine I\u2019ll put it on Facebook like a caveman."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh Leonard. If I was prone to sarcasm I\u2019d say I was pulling off a major heist at the museum of laundry baskets."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You\u2019re right.

And I\u2019d sooner die than eat beans out of a can."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Come on."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Nothing just rethinking my whole life. Okay here\u2019s the thing I\u2019m afraid that if I ask her to move out she\u2019ll just dump me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No to wake up every morning and know you\u2019re there is a great comfort to me. Mmm tasteless.

Real or not?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Me too. It\u2019s comforting to know that she and I are able to function as friends."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Because it\u2019s me going back to school and he\u2019s gonna be all \u201cyou can do it\u201d and \u201chow can I help?\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d Ugh!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Silence!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What?

Penny\u2019s fine the guy she\u2019s kissing is really fine and\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"\u2026 but then it turns good again and that means it\u2019s better than if it had never been bad for a while. I know that now thing\u2019s aren\u2019t good they are in fact very very bad but at least my heart is starting to heal. Slowly but surely. And oh how I cried. It was like a little uh thunderstorm on my face. But I\u2019m a man okay? So I need to pull myself together pick up a pen and get it all out in my journal. I mean it\u2019s not all bad right?

And if anything bad happens what\u2019s the rule?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh I\u2019m sorry I thought making the transition from actor to acting teacher was the signal that one\u2019s career had reached the end of the road."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Are you comfortable?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Good news. Uh the latest episode of Fun with Flags is online."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon I I\u2019m sorry if I hurt your feelings. I\u2019ve been holding a lot of this in for a while."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t know why that surprises you. I\u2019m a grown man. As should be evident by this sport coat and very real flower in my lapel."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Check it out. It\u2019s the gas I use in my free-electron laser to support high voltages.

Zero women that\u2019s my sweet spot."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"So I\u2019d like to try a technique where no one gets steamrolled. When you talk instead of bringing up a new idea respect what was just said by building on it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You are the living embodiment of the beautiful Princess Punchali."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well the Swedes might beat us but at least we won\u2019t get gang-noogied in prison."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I hope the bathroom is clearly marked."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Dad I\u2019m trying to tell you off and you\u2019re ruining it with your delight and relief."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Apparently figure this out on my own \u2019cause you guys are no help at all."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey I plan on levelling up in the game not my swimsuit size thank you very much."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay.

Like if we met her at a bar and you talked me up."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Excuse me this is my apartment and she\u2019s my roommate\u2019s sister."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Too bad. It seems like a good way to drink a milk shake without getting brain freeze."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You know there\u2019s a foundational idea in string theory that the whole universe may be a hologram."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"So I guess I won\u2019t be seeing you guys for a while."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Do you want my help or not?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019m not sure. Some sort of beta-blocker attached to a molecule extracted from the urine of cows."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You\u2019re the one who told Amy in the first place."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well if you like dry factual statements interspersed with painful moments of silence it was bananas."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Why are we saying give it to you like that?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You know it\u2019s no big deal.

Is that a flying man with a killer bod? Wait that\u2019s no man it\u2019s a Norse god."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I thought you were going to talk to Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I push my shoulder against the secret door to see if it gives way."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well I earned it dude I ate all my broccoli."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Of course I\u2019m doing laundry. Saturday night is laundry night and I\u2019m in a laundry room so I believe your inference is justified."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay well thank you for that but I got you and Leonard a few silly neighbour gifts so I\u2019ll just put them under my tree."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s dirty laundry. You\u2019re up."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Amy get out."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"It\u2019s my boss. They moved my field ride up to Monday."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thanks Mother.

And your essay suggesting that I\u2019d have better luck making friends if I wait \u2019til the Cylons take over? Please."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Thanks for the shoes."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Um well I was worried that you might be missing Leonard. And that might be causing you to have bad dreams like the kind you\u2019d get if you watched Clash of the Titans right before you went to bed."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s ridiculous. I am one of the great minds of our generation. I work on a level so rarified you couldn\u2019t even imagine it. I said stop looking at my cool train!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":" Bernadette."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Um Expedition 31 will launch this spring to the International Space Station.

What animal appears second most often on flags?

Wow."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah I do. . As is the tradition I have prepared a series of disrespectful jokes which generate humour at Howard\u2019s expense. Prepare to have your ribs tickled. Howard I always thought you\u2019d be the last one of us to ever get married because you are so short and unappealing. Am I right? Let\u2019s see here. Oh seriously though Howard you\u2019re actually one of the most intelligent people I know. And that\u2019s a zinger because you\u2019re not. I\u2019ve always thought that you\u2019d make someone a fine husband someday. Assuming you\u2019d be able to get the parts and develop the engineering skills to assemble them which I don\u2019t see as likely. Hacha! Okay let me see here. Okay kidding aside Howard you are a good friend. And I wish you nothing but happiness.

See how well we work together?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m at work Sheldon. "},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"This act of aggression must be met with swift and cruel ferocity.

Would you be open to rotating the couch clockwise thirty degrees?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No. But Jessica Alba did rub my furry belly."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right.

This script is terrible."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No I need a new woman in my life to ignore so I can hyper-focus on my work again."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Don\u2019t worry. Wonder Woman was an Amazon. And Amazons tend to be very beefy gals."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah. It can get chilly but Raj figured out that if you pee in a bottle and put it in your sleeping bag it helps keep you warm. Here\u2019s the hotel room we all share."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yes Emily. Whatever. Where\u2019s Sheldon?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Seriously Barry stop."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Make it so."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"So uh what are you guys talking about?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t mean to be rude or discourteous but before we begin I\u2019d just like to say there is absolutely no scientific evidence to support clairvoyance of any kind. Which means and again no insult intended that you\u2019re a fraud your profession is a swindle and uh your livelihood is dependent on the gullibility of stupid people. Again no offence."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You could try saying that without smiling."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"He almost made it to the top this time."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Here. Now are we friends? Colleagues? Lovers? Are you my grandmother?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Let me finish."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh that\u2019s easy enough. We\u2019d need a large tank of water a hoop to jump through and a bucket of whatever bite-sized treats you find tasty."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Really? I didn\u2019t see you draw one from your quiver."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"No Sheldon\u2019s right. Emily did say I always talk about my feelings too much."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No you!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh no let\u2019s assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second. Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Miss Lane who is now travelling at approximately 120 miles per hour hits them and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Perhaps. But my mom made me spaghetti with chopped-up hot dogs whenever I wanted so who cares?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No. No you don\u2019t you really don\u2019t. I actually can\u2019t say don\u2019t enough."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You seemed confused."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I hope she wasn\u2019t anything like my flatmate from Texas."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Can\u2019t believe I\u2019m spending my wedding night with you."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh. You know what? I\u2019m gonna let them know that I\u2019m here with you and that they\u2019re busted."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That was pretty droll. With a hint of ammonia."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m comfortable with that."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I\u2019m sorry I yelled at you. It\u2019s not your fault."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I wouldn\u2019t say she\u2019s beautiful."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah that was the point of the story."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"My aunt Marion gave them to me for my 12th birthday. She thought if I failed at theoretical physics that I should have a trade to fall back on. And by the way the blood pressure cuff is called a sphygmomanometer."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Anyway I\u2019m really sorry I made fun of your stutter in high school."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You do realize I stand on the other side of the door waiting for you to finish knocking three times."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Did he respond yet?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019d like to reinstate the you-not-talking rule."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hey."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh hey."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It\u2019s uh been a long time since I\u2019ve seen a girl\u2019s really not her shoulder."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Probably."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I don\u2019t know maybe it\u2019s the local cuisine.

That\u2019s just what happens in relationships. Look how much Amy\u2019s changed you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah I wish."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay. You know what? I see where this is going. I\u2019m not one of you guys. I\u2019m not a scientist. So just\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No. You\u2019re my friend and I\u2019m sorry."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thanks Dad."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes actually it would but let\u2019s see how the lid goes. I\u2019m not strong enough Leonard you\u2019ll have to do it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"For which she awarded him the nickname \u201cspeed of light Leonard.\u201d"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Something happen at the meeting?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Of course. Now get it yourself you traitor."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hello Howard. I\u2019ve realized that you scaring me was all in jest. Allow me to say job well done.

He\u2019s an idiot."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"For an hour and a half?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Like what?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh I never identified with the rebel alliance. Despite their tendency to build Death Stars I\u2019ve always been more of an empire man."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Look I\u2019m not happy this happened but I think I can get past it. I mean we weren\u2019t engaged at the time and it was just kissing."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Correct."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You don\u2019t like Mouse Boy? How about uh uh Kid Vermin?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It\u2019s true but on the other hand you are wearing a bird sweater."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"All right well anyway Darwin observed that when two groups of finches competed over the same food source eventually one of them would evolve a different beak shape so they could feed on something else."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Really? I wouldn\u2019t know what that\u2019s like."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You can\u2019t ignore it. It\u2019s not that postcard that says it\u2019s time to go back to the dentist."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh good. Namaste Grandpa."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What\u2019s that?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m not sure. It doesn\u2019t feel right."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Penny laid into me too. Apparently I\u2019m overly fixated on premium Swiss chocolate bars."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"God he\u2019s an ass when he drinks."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What does it matter? The point is I\u2019m choosing you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Really? Despite the sign that says \u201cDo not leave laundry unattended\u201d?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yes he\u2019s new at the zoo."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"The entrance to the dungeon is a moss covered door. You manage to open it only to find yourself face-to-face with a hideous foul-smelling moss-covered ogre. What do you do?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s an outrage."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah well then do it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Because I beat you."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Can we please talk about something other than my depressing love life?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Of course I do."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah sorry about that."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Did you pinky swear?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No. Sheldon doesn\u2019t like reclaimed wood."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s amazing."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s the kind of thing you ought to know now that we have one."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh. When I encountered alien life I discovered that the key thing was not to sit in its spot."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Uh huh. So it\u2019s a shelf?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Sold."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh good.

I\u2019d rather get a prostate exam from a leper who walks away with nine fingers."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh the ancient Romans put spiced toast in their punch bowls."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Ah terrific. We\u2019re getting the electron accelerator set up. We should be ready to go day after tomorrow."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I know one way to find out. Sniff this."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Do you like trains?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Not this time. Then they wouldn\u2019t be special. Thanks Penny."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Really?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Actually I was thinking Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"No you see I\u2019m doing this so I can stop being spoiled and you know grow as a person."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well I mean it.

I\u2019ll see you tomorrow."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Maybe you don\u2019t want someone exactly like you. You know what they say opposites attract."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What I\u2019m saying is that we took quite an unnecessary detour from what I now understand to be your thesis."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Mrs Bell was deaf she\u2019s not even going to hear you knock."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What the heck is this?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay great. Oh wait. Uh it\u2019s sold out."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You don\u2019t have to you should want to."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"They\u2019re running a little behind. Should be pretty soon."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well are you talking about when he thought he was real?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well you know that was a long time ago. You\u2019re a different woman now. You\u2019re smart you\u2019ve got great friends you\u2019ve got a boyfriend you\u2019re pretty you have zero fashion sense but anyway tonight we\u2019re gonna do whatever you want."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Does he sound like a criminal?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"He\u2019ll have a Shirley Temple."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No I am not saying that because I kept saying that this morning and Leonard said stop saying that."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"If it\u2019s because you lost a stick I know where it went."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sure. Oh god you smell so good. Of course that could just be my other senses getting stronger. Hypothetically if I had access To a Lieutenant Uhura uniform would you wear it?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Miners often sang mining songs to keep their spirits up."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well I mean yeah it freaked me out a little but that\u2019s my issue not yours."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"As soon as I have the place set up I\u2019m gonna have you guys over."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes. But she knows how important Star Wars is to me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah. The doctor didn\u2019t want me to rub my eye during the night. It was either this or one of those giant neck cones."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well great."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Priya told you. What a little gossip. You know not an attractive quality in a woman Leonard. Not judging just my opinion."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"How about it Sheldon?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Really?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh. Yeah well I was waylaid by Penny Bernadette and Amy. They made me reveal confidential information about Howard\u2019s father."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"While others mourned Lucky I realised his untimely demise provided me with the opportunity to replace him with something more suited to my pet needs. A faithful companion that I could snuggle with at night and yet would be capable of killing upon telepathic command."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"My sympathies. I am no stranger to the crimson scourge that is dermatitis. Can I interest you in a topical steroid from my lotion and unguent collection?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"SNIPE!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Perhaps. But they might ask me something else."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re welcome. And if he has twins we can do all kinds of neat experiments on them."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well we all knew this day was coming."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Maybe your nickname should be Brown Dynamite."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"All right you know what I will tell you why it\u2019s wrong\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well whatever it is it\u2019s troubling me. And I can\u2019t eat I can\u2019t sleep. And don\u2019t even ask about the consistency of my bowel movements."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well here we are."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh true. But all the clenching in the world will not keep testicles in your abdomen."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What are you doing?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh. So the heart you got from the wizard giving you trouble?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s probably USC or UCLA."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So we\u2019re good?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What\u2019s going on is we\u2019re about to go to a prom. And there\u2019s a great deal of pressure on young couples like us to engage in what Mr. Bob Eubanks called making whoopee."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes. If you use my toothbrush I\u2019ll jump out that window. Please don\u2019t come to my funeral.

It\u2019s all good."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t know what that is but if it means I can go home and sleep then yes."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh God oh God oh God! It\u2019s all right. They didn\u2019t take my comic books."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Not me. Ever since you admitted we had a vibe I\u2019ve been planning our wedding."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Because I am without friends. Like the proverbial cheese I stand alone.

And it would be much better if no-one else found out about this."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"She\u2019s in my spot. Don\u2019t look at me like that everybody knows that my spot."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Damn it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No. You\u2019re on vacation."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re in luck this is an easy one. In a world where mankind is ruled by a giant intelligent beaver what food is no longer consumed?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m sorry Dr. Jeffries I\u2019m just excited. This nano vacuum tube idea of yours is it\u2019s really interesting."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Statistically red cars are stopped by police far more often than any other colour.

Well titted."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re kidding right? It\u2019s a bust of Sir Isaac Newton."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well right now Penny\u2019s imagination is running wild but if they meet that will eliminate the mystery and alleviate her fears.

He asked her if she had any questions.

You\u2019ll meet a girl someday."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Actually that\u2019s not true Leonard. In fact recently I\u2019ve been thinking that given the parameters of your experiment the transport of electrons through the aperture the nano-fabricated metal rings is qualitatively no different than the experiment already conducted in the Netherlands. Their observed phase shift in the diffusing electrons inside the metal ring already conclusively demonstrated the electric analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum-interference effect. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all I know. Oh wait! Fig Newtons were named after a town in Massachusetts not the scientist."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"When stuff like this gets me down you know what I like to do?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I can just picture them all right now at Feynman\u2019s house probably discussing Schrodinger and at the same time not discussing Schrodinger.

She\u2019s having risotto for dinner."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"At least I didn\u2019t have to invent twenty-six dimensions just to make the math come out."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I wish we could do more stuff without Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Check."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s not what we planned but this isn\u2019t so bad right?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"There\u2019s this thing online you put yourself on tape and just send it in anyone can do it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Nothing. Just wanted to see if you were both okay."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re wrong again. If my superpower were arrogance my name would be Dr. Arroganto."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Then there\u2019s really no reason to live is there?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hi Rebecca I\u2019m your new friend Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay and here\u2019s the hook. Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning the other plays with bones."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh so my uh parents\u2019 40th anniversary\u2019s coming up and I can\u2019t think of a thing to get them."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay that was uncalled for."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I didn\u2019t get a good look. Can I go again?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay well I ju\u2026 I think it\u2019s important to remember that we move at a pace that is our speed and\u2026 oh shoot I had it!"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yeah I\u2019ve been there as well. I like your tee-shirts with the little pocket."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"And you think it\u2019s better than Tennessee Williams?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh balls."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You know we were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"He\u2019s not that bad. Hey Stuart got any plans Thursday night?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"We can split it two two and two."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"My good man dereliction of duty in the face of the enemy is a court-martial offense."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh yeah no. Turns out that Raj and Howard had to work and Sheldon had a colonoscopy and he hasn\u2019t quite bounced back yet."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yes I can\u2019t get my stupid door open."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sounds perfect."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Peering through his telescope at the birth of the cosmos."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"That could have been about anyone. Besides you have nothing to worry about because now I\u2019m the dusky half of Koothrapenny."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019m an astrophysicist. The stars don\u2019t take a day off."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Ah you\u2019re going off the grid."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Just a toy robot?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Mm I don\u2019t know. I get a lawyer he gets a lawyer it\u2019s just easier to stand behind the tape."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No it wasn\u2019t. Uh now let\u2019s tabulate the results of the experiment. I think it\u2019s safe to say that you\u2019re not in love with me and I\u2019m not in love with you. And psychology has once again proved itself the doofus of the sciences."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That is apt and amusing. I think I shall share that with Amy Farrah Fowler. She\u2019ll appreciate the witticism."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leslie Winkle. Of all the overrated physicists in all the labs in all the world why does it have to be Leslie Winkle?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Do you want him back?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"To mend her broken heart. This situation is much less complicated. There\u2019s some kind of dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV. She just wanted to avoid having a scene with him."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m looking forward to him teaching us glove-slapping."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Star Wars. They get all cranky when you mix the two up."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"No. I\u2019m looking for a hookup."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"So let\u2019s hear from some people who were there at the very start. How Howard flashback sounds."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So do they have a name for a first date with someone you used to go out with?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh I\u2019m working on time-dependent backgrounds in string theory specifically quantum field theory in D-dimensional de Sitter space."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It\u2019s been around for years. It\u2019s like folk music but with a sci-fi\/fantasy theme."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yes. Yes it is. Okay well um come on in."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well when someone looks at your dating profile the first thing they see is your picture. I just want to make sure you look fun and full of life and not like a body they just pulled out of the river. All right here we go and smile. Okay uh-uh that one\u2019s in the bank. How about this? Turn away and then turn back into it. But when you do imagine the camera is the girl you want to meet."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well that\u2019s not acceptable. I mean I\u2019m her boss. She needs to be solely focused on my needs not distracted by your pasty androgynous brand of sexuality."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I beg to differ. I used to live in those genitals. And if someone wants to move into my old room I should at least get a vote."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Not where I can hear you guys."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Alright why don\u2019t we do it your way then? We\u2019ll arrange for this girl to move in across the hall from Dennis so he can pathetically moon over her for months on end."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s surprising because I generally don\u2019t feel comfortable around well anyone."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":" Howard?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Wait wait who\u2019s gonna break it to the penguin?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hang on. Penny do you have plans for dinner?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well if Wil Wheaton and Stuart win their match and we beat lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants in the next round we\u2019ll face off for the championship."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I hardly think so."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Really Leonard? You\u2019re just going to try to recycle Adler\u2019s doctrine of the inferiority complex? I could probably get that from the woman at Ralph\u2019s. And she\u2019d let me taste some pieces of cheese for free."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Look I grew up on a farm okay from what I heard they\u2019re either having sex or Howard\u2019s caught in a milking machine. Do you mind if I stay here tonight?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You\u2019re welcome. How\u2019s your fish?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I can\u2019t believe you kissed my sister with moth mouth."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well maybe you should. There\u2019s lots of books called Sherlock Holmes and there\u2019s no books called Officer Hernandez."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey bud."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Let\u2019s just take the test."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Without me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah sure."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"This isn\u2019t funny anymore. Just say no so we\u2019re done with this. Will you marry me or not?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Are you here alone?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"This is great."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Kind of like Sheldon\u2019s ant farm."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"We are young and fun."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Did you ever do anything like this since we\u2019ve been?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Really? Boy you\u2019d think you could trust a horde of Hungarian barbarians."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No I made him up. I think you\u2019d call him Lee."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Who is it?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hello everyone. I brought my new friend Barry Kripke home for dinner."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You\u2019re nervous? I\u2019ve been stress-eating for four days. Look at me. I\u2019m wearing my fat pants."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Because I want to go back and keep myself from getting a time machine."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hmm?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Fine cheeseburger."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Actually our friendship group is at capacity. But if anybody drops out you\u2019re at the top of the list. Unless it\u2019s Raj in which case we\u2019ll probably get a person of colour."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Maybe. If it did I\u2019d be famous. I\u2019d be on the cover of magazines. And then instead of living alone in my tiny apartment I\u2019d have a big mansion."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right. I don\u2019t want to but at least that makes sense."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"How do you know?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh I don\u2019t know. Who cares? Look at me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No problem I\u2019m very skilled at postponing intercourse. So I guess I\u2019ll call you and we\u2019ll arrange another evening."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah she seems friendly and easy to\u2026 never mind she\u2019s gone. You know maybe talking to people is too hard."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Feelings? What am I a hippie at a love-in? No. The problem is she laid out a series of logical arguments that I couldn\u2019t refute."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You know he won\u2019t be looking at other girls."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019ll start you off easy. Electric eel pufferfish shrimp."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Come on even you checked your e-mail during the eulogy."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"If you were standing behind me nagging I might."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I can\u2019t press any of the buttons with my gloves. Oh son of a bitch!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Bifurcated uvula Sheldon!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well now we know next time we go to the farmers\u2019 market the order is petting zoo first then buy vegetables."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Another football game?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard this is Tom."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well hey we\u2019re grown-ups. We can still be friends."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And if I may get serious for a moment hosting this show has been one crazy ride. But with all its ups and downs I wouldn\u2019t give it up for the world. Except for now when I\u2019m giving it up. Before I sign off I\u2019d uh I\u2019d like to share with you all one last use for a white flag. It\u2019s good for times like this. Good night."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I believe it means that the U.S. Government is going to expel him from the country. He could then either return to his native India emigrate to another country that\u2019s willing to accept him or wander the high seas as a stateless pirate. Personally I\u2019d choose pirate."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It actually looks good Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yeah maybe that is something. How did you find that?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I haven\u2019t been on a job interview in years. I\u2019m really nervous."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Thirty seconds."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"May."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh thank you very much. Come back soon. With the other half of my tip. Hey Sheldon what are you doing here?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well uh I can\u2019t believe you used Sheldon\u2019s toothbrush."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I\u2019m a little jealous of the people who get to do it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh. You know you can just get one of those universal remotes at Radio Shack they\u2019re really cheap."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"jISovbe\u2019 "},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well well well. If it isn\u2019t Wil Wheaton the Green Goblin to my Spider-Man the Pope Paul the fifth to my Galileo the Internet Explorer to my Firefox."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Ooh how about white-water rafting?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay I guess."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What was that?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You know what they all do right?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Way to think outside but pressed right up against the box Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well sometimes you can get free food and Wi-Fi from the neighbours. Just know you might have to marry one of \u2019em."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon I\u2019m gonna get the surgery it\u2019s no big deal. End of story."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No. I quit. "},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh no. I hope everything\u2019s okay."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I think you\u2019d be pleased to hear that this morning in the parking garage I saw this oil stain on the ground that was shaped just like my ex-girlfriend Lucy and I didn\u2019t get upset at all."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You put no thought into that."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay good night."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay okay the point is that we accept your apology."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay so so you don\u2019t want to marry me?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"When we tell this story let\u2019s end it differently."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh dude I wish you had said something before I pounded that last Red Bull."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"A\u2026 are you talking to me?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I know."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What the hell is eighth base?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I appreciate the offer but if things don\u2019t work out with you two I\u2019m swooping in on her like a vulture."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hee-hee just classic."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What? No."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I asked if you were in the shower but that\u2019s moot now."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well I should hope so. I don\u2019t see anyone else banging on this door to put up with your nonsense. Not even a good-bye? You see that\u2019s the kind of thing that makes people think you\u2019re weird. Poor kid. She just doesn\u2019t see it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I spent so much of my childhood at that hospital. When I was 12 I got to ride there in a helicopter."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey guys."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay we can\u2019t keep explaining everything. Read that book we got you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well first we don\u2019t have house guests frankly if I could afford the rent I\u2019d ask you to leave."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Careful it\u2019s that kind of sass that can get a person uninvited to this year\u2019s Who Con."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Go go go go!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Don\u2019t yell at me. I\u2019m not manufacturing. I\u2019m just Web design."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh balls."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Finally something breaks our way."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No. She helped Barry Kripke make an advancement in string theory."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well it\u2019s not what he said."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey I was being hypothetical okay? I would never marry you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Why you guys going somewhere?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"My Rabe-what-ly?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well Leonard wants me to do more stuff like that with him so I thought maybe this year I\u2019d tag along."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Emily listen I\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t come by."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"One Ring to find them."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You think he\u2019ll notice?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Now let me see you feel bad for lying and staying in Detroit longer than you needed to."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Can I bring Leonard?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Um\u2026 she distracted me. I told you Penny I don\u2019t have time for your nonsense I have important things to do."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Give me one circumstance in which that would be useful."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Now Raj kill Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"But it\u2019s beautiful."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No I\u2019m a little rattled. But like the flag over Fort Sumter I\u2019m still here. And take two. Hello. I\u2019m Dr. Sheldon Cooper and welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Over the next 52 weeks you and I are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"And I like to think I helped."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yes we\u2019re fine."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s okay you can owe me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Mother warrior-princess franchise owner I hear glass ceilings shattering all over town."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Sorry won\u2019t bring their kites down. Ow! String burn! String burn!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hi!"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Ooh this is exciting. We\u2019re innovating. I feel like we\u2019re in the Facebook movie."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay great. Um\u2026 uh the thing is we\u2019ve got this friend and he\u2019s kind of down in the dumps and we thought that maybe you could cheer him up."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Anyway to this day I still can\u2019t see a box of crayons without crossing my legs."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Howard you in on this?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Stan Lee."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You know what this place needs? A suggestion box."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay. Penny two of the brightest stars in the night sky are Altair and Vega. And it is said they were deeply in love but forever separated by the celestial river of the Milky Way."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"C\u2019mon Raj how am I supposed to know who she\u2019s attracted to. Or was attracted to. Or who she might be attracted to. In the future."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"For science."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s the one. I believe you went last so uh please?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I can laugh about it now."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"So who\u2019s up for a movie?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh Penny you don\u2019t want to get into it with Sheldon. The guy is one lab accident away from being a supervillain."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s customary when using the rest room at a retail establishment to make a small purchase. Did you?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Mm. Last night I had a dream we got so rich from the app you and I bought matching side-by-side mansions. But there was a secret tunnel connecting your front yard to my back yard. What do you think that means?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"We don\u2019t. This is a disturbing aberration."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No Sheldon I\u2019d rather sit on this freezing cold floor sobbing like a three year-old."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"The volcano thing? No."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019ll tell you exactly what you should do avoid the presumption of the Terran sensory input paradigm."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Dude that\u2019s my sister you\u2019re talking about."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hey everybody. This is my friend Dr. Nowitzki."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Thank you Howard."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh we could set it up like a scavenger hunt where the last puzzle gives the winner Sheldon\u2019s contact information."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019m curious what part of America is that accent from?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I I think he wants us to pull over."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Still haven\u2019t heard from her?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What\u2019s wrong Superman? Locked out of your big ice thingy?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s the only kind of admonishing I do."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I\u2019m going to be 30 years old and I have no one in my life to love me. I\u2019m such a basket case I can\u2019t even talk to a woman without having alcohol in my body."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"It\u2019s not a big deal just a one night showcase but they invite a lot of casting people and agents so you never know."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You understood the math?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay. You want to start loading this stuff into the truck?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sweetie I know you\u2019re trying to make me feel better and I love you for that but it\u2019s making me feel worse and I kind of hate you. This isn\u2019t your car."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"That\u2019s very mature of you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh you\u2019re singing.

The search is over."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh snap."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"We hide behind the Dumpsters in the parking lot and ambush people when they come to pee."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What are you doing right now?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hmm. You see your words sound reasonable but your face looks angry. Help me out here this is not where I shine."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Or we could do something we\u2019ll all enjoy like play a board game."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Sweet!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sure."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019d like to do the math."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah and actually I drink Sauvignon Blanc."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah well who wants to spend the whole weekend running around a bunch of pretend planets battling made up monsters.

Why not Raj too?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What and you think I want to see a documentary about aluminium can recycling?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Leonard just realized that Penny\u2019s been hiding him from her friends because he\u2019s a tiny little man who flies kites."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh yeah? What if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to take a shower in the locker room and let other guys see you naked?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What are you doing?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"A cross we all must bear. You know in difficult moments like this I often turn to a force greater than myself."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh I see. Penny I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m comfortable harbouring a fugitive from the 2311 North Los Robles Corporation."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey buddy. Heard you\u2019re having a rough day. You all right?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard excellent I want to show you something."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You\u2019re just saying that."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I think you were mean before you were pregnant but it\u2019s fine. So uh instead of cleaning out the room why don\u2019t we just decide on a theme for the nursery?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sure. What does he like?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"How\u2019s your leg?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well thank you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Of course I do."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes and he never unified gravity with the other forces. If he hadn\u2019t been such a hound dog we\u2019d all have time machines."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Leonard?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"A good wife would go to the store."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hi!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well up until now I\u2019ve had better things to do.

And I\u2019m okay with that."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I forgot my flash drive."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Um I\u2019m putting on lotion. Are you in or not?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"According to a recent study simply thinking about exercise even while sitting still can have physical benefits. For all you know I could be exercising right now."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"That depends do they have Mexican food in Cuba?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Whoa it\u2019s a little early to start dropping J-bombs don\u2019t you think?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"We all got the Christmas card Cinnamon."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Almost.

Just be strong. And if she starts to cry don\u2019t make any promises. And most importantly put it on speaker so we can hear."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah well you should be. Your socks were still in it. I had to throw it away. Anyway I uh trust that you\u2019ve resolved your conflict."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yeah. Huh. Forty-three? What the hell does that mean?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Look at the two of us. Me a highly regarded physicist. The kind of mind that comes along once maybe twice in a generation. You the common man tired from your labours as a stockbroker or vacuum cleaner salesman or bootblack. But deep down inside apparently we\u2019re just two peas in a pod. A regular pea and the kind of pea that comes along once maybe twice in a generation. Rain. Another great equalizer. Falling on the head of the brilliant and the unremarkable alike.  Smarty-pants."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What are you doing in there? She can\u2019t be in here."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Bernie I just forwarded you a list of the top five lactation consultants in Los Angeles. I know my favourite but I\u2019d love to hear what you think."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh wow that doesn\u2019t seem fair."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Fine. But no more making fun of how I say tings."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Mm-hmm yeah you don\u2019t think I\u2019m smart enough. You think I\u2019m gonna be a liability. Even though I totally just used the word liability correctly in a sentence. Yeah."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Come on."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh. Okay I see. So while he was telling you things did he mention he owns not one but two Star Trek uniforms?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well think about it it\u2019s a product that doesn\u2019t spoil and you\u2019re going to be needing them for at least the next thirty years."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Remarkable. I\u2019m just realizing how much Leonard\u2019s been skating by all these years."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"How\u2019s it working out?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Leonard and Penny I\u2019m sorry for all the trouble I\u2019ve caused. I went to stay at Howard\u2019s. PS Cinnamon\u2019s with me but if you feel like messing with Sheldon tell him she\u2019s loose in the building."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No one ever bought me drinks at a bar because my brain just popped out of my shirt."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Wait Sheldon\u2019s going to be there? We all promised we weren\u2019t going to go."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh stop it he\u2019ll be fine."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You can be Aquaman."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh! Great roll! Now you can demolish your Soviet-style cyclotron and build the large Hadron Collider."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Uh stop selling it kid. You won."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"In a few minutes when I gloat over the failure of this enterprise how would you prefer I do it? The standard I told you so? The classic neener-neener? Or just my normal look of haughty derision?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Ooh look who\u2019s out on a date. Pasadena\u2019s favourite power couple Shamy."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You know what? At least you guys did something. You know you you had a theory you wrote a paper you made an actual contribution. All guys like this do is just stand on other people\u2019s work."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Simple! You want a girlfriend Amy wants to be someone\u2019s girlfriend. Take her off my hands. I give you my blessing."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh she\u2019s your friend. Step up."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Careful Amy. The friend of my enemy\u2019s girlfriend is my enemy."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Me too but I paid three bucks for it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No Cinnamon ate the chocolates. That\u2019s really bad for dogs."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t care."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well that\u2019s a little hard to hear but all right. As you know the essence of diplomacy is compromise. With that in mind I propose the following. I will take Rothman\u2019s office and you will find a way to be okay with that."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"That carrot was delicious."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon this was your idea. A little extra money to get fractional T1 bandwidth in the apartment."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So this is the plan? From now on we\u2019re just gonna hide out in here to avoid the Shamy?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Why do you think I\u2019d be like that? I get it you\u2019re taking one class. It\u2019s nice. Maybe if it goes well you take another you enrol full-time. Ooh be sure to keep an eye on which credits transfer to a four-year college."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You never know when two pieces of paper might temporarily need fastening in the top left corner."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Got you a little something too."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That soy Frappuccino I had."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Because you are not at Big Boy!"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay in Avatar when they have sex in Pandora they hook up their ponytails so we know their ponytails are like their junk."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Thanks."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah he really is."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Tonight is Halo night it\u2019s like talking to a wall."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard I\u2019m trapped in quicksand the axe is dragging me down."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Keebler Elf? I\u2019ve got your Keebler Elf right here.  Okay it\u2019s a stalemate."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Not Penny me!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Me neither. Oh look what I\u2019m reading. It\u2019s you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Are you sure you have enough comics? You\u2019re going to be monitoring the telescope for 12 hours and by my estimate you\u2019ve only selected seven hours of reading material. That\u2019s even factoring in your difficulty in parsing American comic book idioms like Bamf and Snikt."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh. Is it Amy?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Penny. "},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"We might as well go ahead and eat. She\u2019s not coming back anytime soon."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Like it was ten hours ago. What about it?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wonderful. Now what about Euler-Lagrange theorems?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"That sounds amazing. First movie I\u2019m watching Annie."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hello."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"73 is the 21st prime number. Its mirror 37 is the 12th and its mirror 21 is the product of multiplying hang on to your hats seven and three. Eh? Eh? Did I lie?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hi."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It\u2019s my father you jerks. Hello Daddy."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well it matters a lot. I don\u2019t want to be a bran muffin. I I want to be a Cinnabon you know? A strawberry Pop-Tart. Something you\u2019re excited about even though it could give you diabetes."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"All right Sheldon we\u2019re going to Wil\u2019s. This is your last chance."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I know. I feel so grown up."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t drink."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I think I\u2019ll keep it for myself."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh that\u2019s what Amy said. So what\u2019s going on with the research project? Are they gonna let you run it?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Fine. I\u2019ll have a virgin cuba libre."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s just a theory. Uh it\u2019s not even worked out."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh of course. It\u2019s right here in my hand."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Sorry you diverted me. Anyway in 1935 Erwin Schrodinger in an attempt to explain the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics he proposed an experiment where a cat is placed in a box with a sealed vial of poison that will break open at a random time. Now since no-one knows when or if the poison has been released until the box is opened the cat can be thought of as both alive and dead."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Typically that\u2019s an indicator. To you know check your engine."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I understand why no-one else bid."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I suppose that\u2019s one way to look at it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I didn\u2019t say you were I just said she was cute."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Who told you you could touch my board?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m making s\u2019mores. I wanted to alert you in case you smelled caramelizing marshmallows and thought a nearby candy factory was on fire."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"We were on our way to the Chinese restaurant when we thought we saw Adam West so we followed him."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No. They\u2019d rather spend the holiday with each other than find out of this is the year I finally touch a starfish. Anyway I wouldn\u2019t want the tickets to go to waste so take whomever you\u2019d like."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You know you\u2019re gonna make up with him. Can we just skip to that part?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Come on. It\u2019ll be fun."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So you just want us to disagree with whatever you say?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well hey come on just tell me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh you\u2019re right. I could never be with a woman whose self-esteem was so low she\u2019d be with Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh fine. Let\u2019s agree she kissed both of us."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well cell service is down to one bar so if anyone needs medical attention or to tell a stranger their political views are stupid now\u2019s the time."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re really going without me?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Man call spoiler alert before you say things like that."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Schrodinger? Is that the woman in 2A?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah but they don\u2019t have to glue the books together. How the hell are we going to make a thousand Penny Blossoms in one day?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No I said you were teaching someone a lesson. Now let\u2019s go."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Of course sometimes the Federation and the Romulans would enter the Neutral Zone to negotiate a temporary truce."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay. That\u2019s cool. I guess everybody\u2019s involved in this project but me. So see ya."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"And this is also not the right time. Do not propose."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"And what are you getting him back for?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh you\u2019re right. I\u2019m sorry."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yes sir."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"How about your follicle-stimulating hormone levels?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I saw you having naked sex."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Really? Great. Sheldon look. Good as new."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well obviously you don\u2019t remember your circumcision."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Course."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"They should. It\u2019s one of the first things I plan to bring up upon arrival."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"She\u2019s gonna be okay; they\u2019re gonna let me take her home."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh yeah uh right here."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"We did not. That\u2019s not true. Can I speak to you alone for a second?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m sorry Raj but the rules of aerial warfare dictate at the fallen kite go to the victor. And without rules the competition has no meaning. And without meaning the following would be an empty gesture.  I have your kite. I have your kite."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019ve got him Leonard. Tonight I spice my meat with goblin blood!"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You can\u2019t ruin a friendship with sex. That\u2019s like trying to ruin ice cream with chocolate sprinkles."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"The Velcro on my wrist brace caught on my shirt."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019ve never done it on a big old pile of cash before. Me neither Leonard. It\u2019s my first time too."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You only had one."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"This means a lot."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It was but one night Sheldon came home from work\u2026 "},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Guys this person\u2019s just going out of their way to get a rise out of you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"August 7 842 a.m. This is humiliating. What was wrong with diapers?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah but I don\u2019t see a better one on the horizon so\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"When did you learn how to pick locks?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"This is our year! With those guys out the entire physics bowl will kneel before Zod."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Other people might be interested."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I hate to pile on the bad news but I just got a raise."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well now hold on how about this? How about we still hang out but on the down-low?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah I know I know that part."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wouldn\u2019t you like to know?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Stuart and I are putting dating profiles online and it\u2019s one of the questions. And thank you I\u2019d kill for that woman\u2019s bone structure."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Maybe. It\u2019s a prime number. Encryption systems are built on prime numbers."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It won\u2019t work. No way to mount it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I really appreciate this."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You frightened me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll I\u2019ll take care of it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Already taken care of. Observe. This is a live shot of Kripke\u2019s lab via a mini webcam I was able to install thanks to a dollar bill discreetly placed in the night janitor\u2019s shirt pocket. At the same time I also secured large quantities of these chemicals above the tiles in the drop ceiling."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m just in a good mood. While my compatriots are in Las Vegas I will be enjoying a blissful evening in my personal Fortress of Solitude."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Not that far back!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh yeah you know what maybe we should just slow things down a little."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"It was pretty good. We won."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"They were out of scones."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Here\u2019s an interesting fact about alcohol."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hello Hawaii.

Make of that what you will."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Just because I didn\u2019t express myself well doesn\u2019t mean my underlying point was invalid! You bloviating buffoon!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Right "},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Really?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Come here you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Is it true even when the man lets his dog lick peanut butter off his tongue?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay are you sure about this?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh look she calls you Moon Pie.

So it\u2019s gonna be hours before we know if it even survived."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well I appreciate your concern but I won\u2019t be seeing any more of Amy than I already do.

We discovered a medium-sized asteroid together."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Look I appreciate your signature blend of concern for me and incredible selfishness. If I get the chance to do this there is nothing you can say that\u2019s going to stop me."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"And you do it all the time.

Am I correct in assuming that your attempt to be accepted by Penny\u2019s peers is based on your desire to ensure your continuing mating privileges with her?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019ve been thinking about names I\u2019m kind of torn between Einstein Newton and Sergeant Fuzzyboots."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"All right want some French toast?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"A little messy? The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy this is chaos. Excuse me explain to me an organisational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid.

Here."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No I I really didn\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well if we accept your premise and also accept the highly improbable assumption that Penny is the only woman in the world for you then we can logically conclude that the result of blowing it would be that you end up a lonely bitter old man with no progeny. The image of any number of evil lighthouse keepers from Scooby Doo cartoons comes to mind."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"All right don\u2019t worry. I talked to Leonard. He is gonna sit the guys down and set them straight."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t need to see your presentation.

Like Burt and Ernie. You guys even teach me stuff about words and numbers."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"And bring you home. So why don\u2019t you pack up your stuff and we\u2019ll head back."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I\u2019m implying that you\u2019re a creature of habit and if something were to prevent you from doing your laundry on Saturday at 815 you might find it unpleasant.  Knuckle under my ass."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Fine. Mock Parliamentary procedure. At least put it on mute."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Letting him make me happy."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I say you tell Alex your heart belongs to Penny I provide her a shoulder to cry on and then roughly half a year later I give it to her good."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh no."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I believe you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well you could have set Newton\u2019s gravitational constant to one. And ugh the whole thing reeks of blueberry. You know I can\u2019t stand these scented markers."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Boy it wasn\u2019t this hard with Bon Jovi. I said you rock he said thanks man and that was that."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh that would be a good way to go."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Rock rock water fountain. I am not proud of this but I have been envious of your recent success."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Perhaps you can think of this n a more positive light. In one day you\u2019ve managed to do what it takes many couples decades to achieve."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well you eloped and we didn\u2019t get a chance to throw you a bachelor party so there\u2019s a van downstairs and we\u2019re here to take you to a surprise location for the weekend."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh who was that girl from our Starbucks?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What did Penny mean you\u2019d make a cute couple?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Mmm you liked Professor Guyster\u2019s wedding."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Uh wasn\u2019t there supposed to be a zombie?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I forgive you. Let\u2019s go home."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I think that\u2019s our girl. One of us should go talk to her."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay look I think that you have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble Telescope does of discovering at the centre of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight searching for a circuit breaker. Nevertheless I do feel obligated to point out to you that she did no reject you. You did not ask her out."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh. Sorry. Didn\u2019t know you made those. Hey listen what if we have a little mother-in-law daughter-in-law dinner tonight?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Sarcasm?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What about \u201cdamsel in distress?\u201d"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All I know is after the fight I went to Emily\u2019s to smooth\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I sure did. Oh my goodness. Well from Jabba\u2019s head to ice cream with Darth Vader I\u2019m having a heck of a ride. Yeah look clearly good things happen when I\u2019m in charge. Now why don\u2019t you boys step aside let me knock this project out?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It was until I realized the screen had frozen. Still one of my top three dates of all time."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"If I was okay I would\u2019ve said hello and not the much more ominous hello."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Really? It\u2019s okay if I listen with you?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yup."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Are you saying that you will not stand beside me as I plead my case?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Where exactly?

I don\u2019t remember the episode of Star Trek where the guy never goes to space and brags about it in a tuxedo store."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh God. That I\u2019ve heard on multiple occasions. In what universe is that lightly toasted? This has to be the worst day of my life. Good morning Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"It wasn\u2019t a real proposal."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I did."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It ends with dinosaurs.

Try and go online."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"This is not over."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t know how that sentence could possibly confuse you but to elaborate I\u2019m going to the Arctic Circle with Leonard Wolowitz and Koothrappali."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well yeah I guess."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Some sports bar. It\u2019s like they never even heard of Quidditch. Do we really have to go?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Excuse me I take care of him."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It wasn\u2019t awkward. It wasn\u2019t fun. Besides what\u2019s the big deal we dated we stopped dating and now we\u2019re both moving on."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh no."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well what should I do?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Really? That\u2019s very unsettling."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hi you guys ready to order?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Can you believe there was a time when we would have needed an array of giant Cherenkov telescopes to detect cosmic particles? And here we are building our own multi-wire detector like a couple of badasses."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wait wait. Where\u2019s my bag? My phone and my wallet are in my bag."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Now I\u2019m making sure the telescope\u2019s camera is white-field balanced and wishing you had a colouring book."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"See Howard\u2019s just as good a dungeon master as I am."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That depends.

Neener neener."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wait. It was me. I opened your toy discovered it was broken and didn\u2019t tell you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That is not what I said. Look I think you\u2019re really good. I truly do. But this is an incredibly hard thing that you\u2019re shooting for. I mean the odds of anyone becoming a successful actor are like a million to one."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"All right well what do you think he wants?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I know. I\u2019m still learning to control it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No he doesn\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No we can\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Wow."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Wait wait wait.

Let me try again. Have the indigenous fauna accepted you as one of their own? Nudge nudge wink wink."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Bat-signal?

Oh my God Sean Penn!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019ve taken a great evolutionary leap by abandoning human interaction and allowing yourself to romantically bond with a soulless machine.

It\u2019s a childish trick designed to confuse and intrigue simpletons. How\u2019d you do it?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Could have beaten around the bush a little."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"With a hologram? Nice. Hey do you see this?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Look I\u2019m sorry. I was drunk I was lonely I hated Zack. Can we just forget it ever happened?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I\u2019m so happy you asked me here and I hope we can hang out again sometime.

This goes on for a while until the owner finally asks him what he\u2019s doing. The man says \u201cwell I\u2019m a physicist and quantum mechanics teaches us that it is possible for the matter above this stool to spontaneously turn into a beautiful woman who might accept my offer and fall in love with me.\u201d The owner then says \u201cwell lots of single beautiful women come in here every day why don\u2019t you buy an ice cream for one of them and they might fall in love with you?\u201d And the physicist says \u201cyeah but what are the odds of that happening?\u201d"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Just to help her with her screenplay."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You don\u2019t need to do that it\u2019s okay."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I skipped spin class for this."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I don\u2019t want to hug you either.

I thought they were out West someplace."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m pretty sure I never said that."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Actually I\u2019m paraphrasing.

Yeah let\u2019s all be mad at Stuart."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t know. You\u2019ll have to devise a scenario that plausibly explains my absence keeping in mind that the key to a good lie lies in the details."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah I agree the social sciences are largely hokum.

Ten years ago upon first seeing me your husband claimed that I looked like C-3PO and Pee-wee Herman. And he called me C-3P-wee Herman."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay well you know this isn\u2019t that bad. It just paints the picture of a very affectionate woman who\u2019s open to expressing her affection in non traditional locales."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"It\u2019s okay I\u2019ll still go."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Raj Imperial Troopers on your tail."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well I spent most of the afternoon growing isotopically pure crystals for neutrino detection."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Ready when you are Professor Hawking."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Exactly.

I decided to find a way that I could have this experience and enjoy it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh no."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I ask you for one simple thing and you can\u2019t even do it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Here this will help."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well what I meant was I often misinterpret how others are feeling. Like I can\u2019t always tell if someone is only joking or laughing at me. You know like uh if they\u2019re mad at something I\u2019ve done or just in a bad mood. It it\u2019s incredibly stressful."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh what choice do I have? You need me. I\u2019m like the crankshaft of this team."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh Leonard mumbles it when he wants sex to last longer."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay look here\u2019s the thing. I like pharmaceutical sales it\u2019s going great but I have an audition for a movie and if I get it it could screw everything up."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey what are you guys doing here?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That\u2019s actually funny."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey here\u2019s your tip from table seven."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Don\u2019t tell anybody I told you but I heard she might be breaking up with him."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"But first I cast a spell of paralysis on Stuart and Howard."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No I know but plenty of things are addictive after a single exposure. I mean crack cocaine nicotine Pringles. You know once one pops one just can\u2019t stop."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"He doesn\u2019t; he just likes looking at them. Bring a book."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What\u2019s wrong with Mexico?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You really think we made a mistake?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Very hard."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well it was the two of you who found Amy Farrah Fowler for me. Now that I\u2019m looking for my next girlfriend it seemed only logical that I employ your services once again."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hello?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I really should have brought my own car."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Raj? What are you doing? I don\u2019t think so. You\u2019ve had your allotted six ounces. The first bathroom break isn\u2019t until the Denny\u2019s located near Bakersfield which is approximately two and half hours away. Remember people we\u2019re only as strong as our weakest bladder."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Really? Because usually we walk side by side and I just went up two flights of stairs staring at your bottom."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah please reserve chitchat for your breaks Ms. Jenson. FYI there will be no breaks."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Thank you. You know I can buy all these things online. I come here for the personal service."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Alright noted.

Hang on. I believe I\u2019m supposed to carry you across the threshold."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Maybe there\u2019s a way to get them to come up with it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah but only because I was dating a second grader."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Excuse me?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"\u2018Sup?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No no. It\u2019s not an imposition. At this point in our ecosystem you are akin to the plover a small scavenging bird that eats extra food from between the teeth of crocodiles. Please fly into our open maw and have at it."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh cool. Can I play?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"May I have one of your fries?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That would be you. But residing within you is the potential for another me. Perhaps even taller smarter and less prone to freckling a Sheldon 2.0 if you will."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right what if we use this two-inch PVC to reinforce the centre cross-support?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah. Start Saturday morning go 48 hours sleeping bags junk food."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What if the fighting is the reason we\u2019re making progress?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah perfect."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Have you ever considered trying to do something useful? Perhaps reading to the elderly?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay so what is solder?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh Amy you lucky girl."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh wait here. I\u2019ll get some Alka-Seltzer we can build that rocket and we can shoot it at Bill Nye\u2019s house. As long as I\u2019m not within 500 feet of it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well you call it love but it has a lot of raisins in it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well when you get the machine you can find out."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh I have quite the evening planned. Our foetus-friendly festival of fun begins with an in-depth look at the world of model trains and then we\u2019ll kick things up a notch and explore all the different ways that you can make toast."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Why say it?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Um NC\u2026 II\u2026 or you know NCSTD\u2026 I don\u2019t know it\u2019s it\u2019s you know it\u2019s the one with the letters and I\u2019m gonna be on it!"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"He\u2019s been murdered by someone in this room."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Right. Um okay. Leonard I mean you\u2019re not only the love of my life. I mean you\u2019re my best friend and you\u2019ve got a friend in me. You got troubles. I got \u2019em too.

You know what I\u2019m talking about."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What\u2019s with the robe?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"When I broke my arm I used to stick a coat hanger down there. You ever try that? Maybe go in through the ear?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Terrific."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Mm I\u2019m thinking about adopting some quirky affectation like a pipe or a monocle or a handlebar moustache."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh you are such a\u2026  What the hell is he doing?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"This conversation is over."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Do you know what he\u2019s talking about?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I spoke to the reporter at the magazine."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I I hope we didn\u2019t make the puzzles too hard."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"This is so amazing."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Brown rice not white?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That sounds like a late night and I have work in the morning so\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Me too."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Right right.

No I sent Leonard in with a pointy stick and a bag."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"So then I went to Cambridge which was wonderful not only because it\u2019s a good school but because it totally looks like Hogwarts. That\u2019s where I fell in love with astronomy and now I\u2019m an astrophysicist at Caltech so I guess you could say uh Raj is my name and stars are my game. And rhyming is also my game.

What is there a problem?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hold that thought Leonard a moment."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No no no. You know they have suffered enough.

Please tell my parents that our dark matter research is at a critical juncture and I can\u2019t come home for my cousin Sanjay\u2019s wedding."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh nice guy. But it was a little weird to hear Batman say don\u2019t ring the doorbell or my poodles will go crazy."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You should have told him to mind his own business."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay well can we imply that you\u2019re well-endowed?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"The Indian sex book. In other words if you wonder wonder who wrote the book of love it was us."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"How can you be late I wasn\u2019t expecting you at all."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon don\u2019t make that noise it\u2019s disrespectful."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What about this one?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"But you have to make a motion to put it on agenda."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What? That\u2019s a real thing? What is it Star Wars Christmas?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh. That\u2019s just as well. They had me on hold for 20 minutes and I hung up.  Leonard?

It\u2019s three-person chess. I must say ever since you started having regular intercourse your mind has lost its keen edge. You should reflect on that."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Amy\u2019s got some news."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hu-u-u-uh\u2026.

And all from a country whose entire contribution to the global economy has been Tetris and mail-order brides."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"The TV is gone."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sheldon it\u2019s Saturday night you\u2019ll be doing laundry."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well I assume you\u2019re not referring to digestive regularity? Because I\u2019ve come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Because the truth made me look bad whereas a ridiculous bald-faced lie makes me look good. Anyway if Kripke asks tell him my coitus with Amy is frequent intense and whimsically inventive."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Will the gentleman from the great state of denial yield for a question?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well he\u2019s smart and crazy enough he may have actually created a monster. "},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Here. You\u2019re sad so I made you tea."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Waking up wondering which one of those fans stole our wallets."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You know what?

In the world of emoticons I was colon capital D."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh then you all can get tenure."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Why don\u2019t we take him to see the Blue Man Group?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"No I\u2019m not jealous. All right I\u2019d kill a hobo if it\u2019ll get me laid. Now can we order?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh no. At home. The servants would sing to me laugh at my jokes. I wish I knew their names."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh let\u2019s see. Yup 30 pieces of silverware."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh I miss her already."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That\u2019s not it because you\u2019re clearly upset."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Get him out."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes but whoever\u2019s her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of experience and not to mention that fact that sh\u2026. "},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I stand corrected."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"We\u2019re home."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"One of them broke up with you. Do you really want her telling the other one why?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You see behind the fountain that tower that looks like a pyramid? It\u2019s called a Sikhara. It symbolizes the the connection between the human and the divine."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Get up we can\u2019t lose at math."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You know once I proposed to him."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What if they were mobsters who slept with the fishes?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"And he\u2019s picking the tomatoes out of his salad just like I do. I always did feel a connection with him. Oh I have got an idea."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah i remember us driving up there going to the winery and that\u2019s it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh good."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Really that\u2019s a lot of work and it\u2019s kind of late."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You realize you can\u2019t win."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay uh please don\u2019t take this the wrong way but I\u2019d rather swim buck-naked across the Ganges with a paper cut on my nipple and die a slow agonizing death from a viral infection than work with you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hey let\u2019s not pull at that thread. Okay. I\u2019ll fight SpongeBob because he\u2019s so friendly we\u2019ll just end up tickling each other. Um I\u2019ll befriend the seal because he\u2019s trainable which is the problem I\u2019m having with my current friends. Which means I\u2019ll have to eat the hagfish."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Answer the question what are you doing here?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Howard get out."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"And there was no-one there to take care of you?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"This is it."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey guys. Mind if Emily joins us for lunch?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I think Leonard\u2019s mom\u2019s okay with me."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You\u2019re dating somebody who is it?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That Raj\u2019ll be on it before we make it to the freeway?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh right. Ladies and gentlemen our guest of honour Dr. Sheldon Cooper."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Stan Lee does not have a contagious skin disease."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hi."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Of course you did. It was a fun and practical way of organizing your school work. But the bullies took it from us. Well no more. Tonight we take back our dignity our birthright and our pride. What do you say? Who\u2019s with me?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I want grilled cheese."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"How does he get the helium?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Don\u2019t worry. They only stay on your record for a year."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Will you tell him he\u2019s out of his mind."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Please let it go Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So relax. We\u2019re happy to have you."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hey what\u2019s your problem?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay let\u2019s go through this one more time. Just because Leonard has a new girlfriend does not mean I need to go out and hook up with some guy."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Having a little trouble catching your breath there?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Do not tell me about my own culture Sheldon! In the mood I\u2019m in I\u2019ll take you out I swear to cow!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"This is not my laundry."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"A favour? Sure you can ask me a favour I would do you a favour for you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You still got the part. That\u2019s a huge accomplishment."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"How can you be embarrassed around me? I\u2019m gonna be in the room with you when you give birth."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay can I ask you something? Why do you like making us do this stuff?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey uh thanks for keeping me company."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Smooth."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yes we did Kripke."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh yeah."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hello."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah way ahead of you. I will play the word at for two measly points throwing the game and thus securing my friendship with the smartest man in the world."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I forbid it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh alright. I will give you my bed on one condition. That you promise to zip your hole for the next eight hours."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So is it everything you hoped it would be?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I found these in the dryer. I\u2019m assuming they belong to Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay look here\u2019s something people do not know about me. When I first moved out to L.A. I did a topless scene in a low-budget horror movie about a killer gorilla. Ugh! After I did it I felt so ashamed. Thankfully that thing never came out."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"This is ridiculous. Dammit Sheldon snap out of it. You\u2019re a physicist you belong at the University doing research not hiding in your room. "},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s eleven am."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re tricking me. You tell me the truth what do we get?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay so she drops off a five hundred dollar gift and she\u2019s not trying to get back together with you?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I know."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Good to know? What\u2019s that supposed to mean?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well sure."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Ah the talking cure. Classical Freudian good choice. If it will help speed things along uh my answers to the standard Rorschach ink blot test are A a bat B a bat C a bat and D my father killing my mother with a hypodermic needle."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay you\u2019re kind of really great."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Thank you for saying that. Next to buying things that is the best part about having money."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Anyway I wanted to apologize. I am truly sorry."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Enjoy Oxnard. I\u2019m sure your daughter\u2019s looking forward to having you."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Great. I bought her a couple of drinks and she gave me her e-mail address."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well-groomed vampires meet in pairs and shave each other. Case closed."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Don\u2019t worry I won\u2019t look."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No! No no! I wasn\u2019t going to say any of that. I was just going to say I really like you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What\u2019s going on with your dad?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Is that Howard in front of us?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hi. Again."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah that sounds right."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No thank you. Delivery men are the unsung foot soldiers of our nation\u2019s commerce. It\u2019s because of people like you people like me can limit our human contact. I\u2019d shake your hand but well you know."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You know I think this is one of those things where talking about it is not going to make it better. Want a glass of wine?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"But what if Man-Man dressed as a bat?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Dear Lord are you still going to be here on French Toast Day?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Really nothing?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay well can we go talk in the living room?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh by the way thank you for the delicious cocoa."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yes like a museum but anything else."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Alright. Goodnight."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Mr. Jeffries I need to show you something. 1411446"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You were in the middle of an erection."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah until someone left him in the drugstore parking lot and he freaked out."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Mm. Well I think more about if I\u2019d have any regrets."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No Bernadette don\u2019t be a hero!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"If the word is pee-pee just do it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I didn\u2019t say it was fascinating I said it was noteworthy."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yeah anything is better than this."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Gentlemen this is the Coast Starlight one of the great American trains operating on one of the classic American routes. On this side you\u2019ll see panoramic ocean vistas inaccessible to any other form of transportation while on your side you\u2019ll be treated to 350 miles of CostCos Jiffy Lubes and cinderblock homes with above-ground pools."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well you should be \u2019cause she was looking good."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh he had to leave."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You think you should call Amy?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"They make up a non-Newtonian fluid which is liquid but solid under the percussive action of the speaker."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh come on! Why not?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Aren\u2019t you worried you\u2019re making French toast on oatmeal day?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"\u2018Kay."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Give it up dude you\u2019re arguing with a crazy person."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"But it wasn\u2019t my fault. I didn\u2019t exclude him. And I didn\u2019t write the article."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Fifteen seconds."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh that would be a good way to go."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Because you want to start watching it right now. Copy that. Let\u2019s see. Up next on the tenure committee is Professor Wu. Well get ready for the complete works of Jackie Chan."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey why did you get two? I\u2019m with stupid."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Thank you you are a good citizen. Told you. Go ahead throw my underwear out the window. Same thing\u2019s gonna happen."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well uh Penny is on her way to perform in a one night showcase production of Rent which we are unable to attend because we are going to a symposium on molecular positronium given by Dr Emile Farminfarmian."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon I accept your apology but you upset a lot of people while you were sick. I\u2019m not in a position to just say you can come."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Schnapps. You\u2019re right that is fun."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Or as you probably call it back home food."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s called Scientists. Now I will name three scientists then you will put them in order of the size of their contribution to their respective fields. To make this game even more compelling you must consider only the contribution of the man to the field not the validity of the field itself. For example Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayn made a greater contribution to the discredited field of alchemy than Halbert Vanderplatt made to neurobiology. Okay ready to have some fun?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon!"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Really? Then what were you doing at the comic book store that night?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Of course."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Are you still going to tell him about you-know-who?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Is it bad? Did you hear something? Oh my God. It\u2019s bad. Somebody kill me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Of course I do. I don\u2019t want that Swedish team scooping us."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I can if you\u2019d just roll over and accept your fate."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Too bad. I\u2019m coming with you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well you\u2019re a physicist not a circus clown."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Whatcha doin\u2019?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m not being stupid. I\u2019m employing the work of Dutch researcher Mirjam Tuk who found that people with full bladders make better decisions."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Don\u2019t do that in socks I almost broke my neck."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I think it\u2019s an old storage room."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hah-hah!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m fine with it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"My friend Justin."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sex doesn\u2019t count."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Did you go to your prom?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Arthur. What are you doing here? I I don\u2019t think I need any more advice."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh. Oh I\u2019m sorry. Correction that woman not only had vigorous coitus with Bert she also tipped him a dollar for a job well done. \u2013 That better?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh I would but we need to make a push on the air force project."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Like what?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"A Slim Jim?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"We just spent two hours in traffic. Did you think to mention to me that you liked our paper?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"But I\u2019m hanging out with my friend and we\u2019re having fun. Look how happy he is."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well they\u2019re pretty tasty."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yeah."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What happened to you?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Are you sure this is right?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"So you\u2019re wandering all around by yourself? That\u2019s not the kind of hero\u2019s welcome an astronaut should come home to."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Not the roommate agreement."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m not seeing anyone using liquid helium vortices like this."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"This is nothing but a blatant abuse of power by a petty functionary. Explain to me why Wil Wheaton and his lackeys get in and we don\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So um Amy what about you? Do you date much?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I didn\u2019t tell Sheldon so we could have a few days alone."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Guys."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"But that\u2019s my room."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I have no idea what she\u2019s talking about but we\u2019re ganging up on you so I agree."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Happy and well-fed. You see that\u2019s what I\u2019m taking from that story."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I know this isn\u2019t my area and I could never do the math like you can but could this be something?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Doing it right now. Oh they can\u2019t. There\u2019s an important Little League game tomorrow."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well now they\u2019re yours."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right my friend. Would you like some cholermus?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay now what you want to do first is turn on the ignition and shift into drive."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"We believe cows are gods."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I don\u2019t want you to make a big deal out of it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay step four. Do you see that small plastic case on my dresser?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh well apparently Leonard thinks he\u2019s better than everyone in the whole world including those fighting for our freedom. Yeah well I don\u2019t know about you but I support our boys overseas."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I\u2019d like you to call me sexy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I expect you to wipe the pudding off your chin. Gentlemen."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Never leave a belt on the floor. At night they look like snakes."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"In sunglasses and a hat after I parked two blocks away."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s by way of an apology for my recent behaviour. I\u2019ve had some time to reflect and I\u2019ve come to realize that friendship is not an aggregation of written agreements. It\u2019s a result of two people respecting and caring for each other. Butterscotch scone?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What 21 seconds? That\u2019ll be like seeing a whole new movie!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh my God. What personal habits?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Never noticed that about you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I have spent years turning this lump of clay into an acceptable conduit for my will and then you came along and reshaped him with your newfangled ideas and your fancy genitals."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah uh I got a job as a pharmaceutical sales rep."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"The reason that date is like so totally fixed in my memory is that I had the privilege to be witness to one of the most heroic acts I\u2019ve ever seen in like ever."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh oh on the contrary. Couples costumes are one of the few benefits of being in a relationship. Now imagine this you and I entering Stuart\u2019s party and all eyes turn to see America\u2019s most beloved and glamorous couple."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Ah I feel just like Mother Teresa. Except for the virgin part. That ship sailed a long time ago."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Sonny and Cher made it work. Their variety show kept going long after the divorce and here we are still talking about them."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Funny how things work out isn\u2019t it?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No. No no no no."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wait hang on. You\u2019ve spent time with Amy. Can you think of anything she\u2019s fond of that has a bunch of flaws she hasn\u2019t noticed?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"So did I."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Fine. Give me a second."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes. Must be killing you wondering who. Fine I\u2019ll tell you. Stuart from the comic bookstore Barry Kripke from the university Penny\u2019s ex-boyfriend Zack and TV\u2019s LeVar Burton."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Wait a second the good wife is crying. Something\u2019s very wrong."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"We could tell him they wanted the couch to stay away from their boyfriend."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"When I\u2019m lying comatose in a hospital relying on inferior minds to cure me these jello cultures and my accompanying notes will give them a fighting chance."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Come on Sheldon. You know all the Christmas stories and the carols you\u2019ve got an eggnog moustache going on there. Just admit it. You\u2019re getting a little Yuletide spirit."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What\u2019s he talking about?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Cover this suckers. Ha-ha-ha!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I went to the market with Penny."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Wait I thought we were reading."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Do you really think there\u2019s gonna be a breakthrough without you there to do it?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yes. Oh bet your girlfriend is super bummed you had to work tonight. Anyway look we have been waiting a while and I just\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hey. Emily right?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yeah you\u2019re missing the point Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Are you sure? It just doesn\u2019t feel as innocent as it used to."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So tell me about your day how\u2019s it going with the particle detector?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t hear anything after lick."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Shake it baby shake it!"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What are you drawing over there?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh you\u2019ve been falling all night. You\u2019re used to it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes for the first five or six years but I\u2019ve gotten used to it. It helps me sleep. He\u2019s like my mucus-powered white noise machine."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Not at all. Amy?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay. I\u2019m just gonna tie my shoe while you think about that."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"For shame Leonard. For shame. And to think I was ready to waste the last of my good haemorrhoid cream on you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Where are you going?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I do. You know Leonard\u2019s right. Talking to you is really helping."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I smell Chinese food."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That would be my understanding. On a less painful subject what size T-shirt do you take?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Look if you weren\u2019t happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I can\u2019t believe the Air Force would treat us like that."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hi. So nice to finally meet you. Let me take this for you Meemaw."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey when you got home today complaining that you felt sick from eating too many jelly beans did I tell you how to fix it? No. I said aw that must hurt and I rubbed your belly."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Listen to me. You are over-tired. You\u2019re not thinking right. Put the movie back before we get into trouble."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Lucky."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I see. I own nine pairs of underpants."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You sure it\u2019s not too much Bible juice?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I\u2019m on a cloud. Swing me. "},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It\u2019s like we both had these holes in our lives but now we fill each other\u2019s holes."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So we made you an appointment and we want you to keep it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh I\u2019d be incensed."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey since Sheldon\u2019s not going to Comic-Con maybe we could find a cool trio to dress up as."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh. Well so the emotional turmoil that\u2019s been keeping me from achieving REM sleep was entirely unjustified?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well I\u2019m going back to India. What\u2019s your plan?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Seriously do I not get credit for knowing beta test?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Short Round?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No I don\u2019t want to break his heart. I love him. This is just happening too fast."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Waltz. It\u2019s a social dance from Austria choreographed to a three-four time signature. "},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"In the last two hours 162 women have read our profiles. How many of them have sent us messages?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well anyway um you may find this hard to believe but I didn\u2019t have any friends growing up."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And to clarify?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s fine. And also not true."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Mother if you\u2019re going to conduct your life in this fashion then I should let you know that the world has changed since you were a young woman. You know it\u2019s not all sock hops soda jerks and segregation anymore."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Junior Mints are pretty apologetic."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I just told her you\u2019re an aerospace engineer you speak five languages\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I knew it. Just keep going I guess I\u2019m good at this."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yes I\u2019m very hopeful. Hello Missy.  They mentioned there may be side effects."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Come on."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Because we don\u2019t throw parties."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I appreciate the apology but it\u2019s really not necessary. I overstepped my bounds."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I\u2019m regretting this already."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh I don\u2019t want credit for that."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well come now Leonard this may be your only chance to make a real contribution to science!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sheldon I\u2019m gonna make some cocoa. Do you want some?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Uh he\u2026 ."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sheldon what did we say about being a nicer friend?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hello Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"It\u2019s really good. We\u2019ve been talking about the origins of slavery. Turn in my first paper tomorrow."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You know in India when my baby brother cried like that the servants would just take him far away so we couldn\u2019t hear it. Not always sometimes we\u2019d leave."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You laugh now you just wait until you need tech support."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What if that burning food attracts animals?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s happy right?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Nobody calls me Moon Pie but Meemaw!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Not only did they eat together Leonard said he made her laugh."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh hi. Hey. Hi Leslie."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Mmm."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"So your theme is I saw a rerun of Mad Men and bought some crab puffs from Trader Joe\u2019s? Hate to miss that."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Maybe he didn\u2019t know what to pair champagne with. Strawberries caviar oysters. All good choices. Yeah that look right there is why people eat before they come to your parties."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh Sheldon you remind me of a young Lex Luthor."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Bakersfield. I see. Where has this list been all my life?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Euclid Avenue is shorter as the crow flies but it has speed bumps which appreciably increase point-to-point drive time making it the less efficient choice. But you have the conn. Of course if you\u2019re not going to slow down for the speed bumps I withdraw my previous objection. Here\u2019s a fun question.

That would solve everything. You are the best. I\u2019ll see you at dinner tonight?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"My point is there was a time I never would\u2019ve been friends with someone like you and now you are one of my favourite people. So if what you need is to spend your birthday in a bathroom I\u2019m happy to do it with you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well you know I gave you the snowflake and we were kissing and\u2026 Oh come on I don\u2019t want to go to Texas!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I had to; we\u2019re married now."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh Mario. If only I could control everyone the way I control you. Hop you little plumber hop hop hop."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay indoor it is. Big or small?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Ah the premature I love you."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey. What brings you by?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Great. Then she won\u2019t know I\u2019m lying."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh I\u2019m so sure I\u2019m going to regret this but who was I with?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I I nibbled. I was being playful."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Says the former member of the Corn Queen\u2019s Court."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"They\u2019re perfect. It tastes like her hugs."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"To my bedroom so I can take everything off but those glasses. And maybe the boots."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh yeah? What about it?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah and the hors d\u2019oeuvres are delightful."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What about me what?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Can we just focus on the decision I\u2019m facing?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Open wide here comes the happy train."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah no no I-I-I got that."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Um\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I assumed he was joking. You\u2019d be surprised how many particle physicists have a whimsical side."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Ah. Well I\u2019m sure things will pick up."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I found another tweet from a student at Sheldon\u2019s lecture. Dr. Cooper has taken a relatively boring subject and managed to make it completely insufferable. Plus he looks like a giant insect."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"But this is other money."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh don\u2019t be. You get your hopes up I knock them down. That\u2019s called teamwork."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I wonder how they smell."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"My name is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali and this is my friend Dr. Sheldon Cooper."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re making it difficult to love you right now."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m sorry Penny I don\u2019t think so."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What is everyone booing at?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Why?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"This looks like some serious stuff Leonard did you do this?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re kidding right?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hey congratulations Bert."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Go ahead make jokes. I don\u2019t know why you think you\u2019re going to Comic-Con you just had a baby."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah sure."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I wouldn\u2019t mind a glass."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Mmm when really we\u2019re just exiting an uncomfortable situation."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Uh well you know your private bathroom?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey what\u2019s up?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I have no idea. Because the story of me sewing the first American flag is unsupported poppycock."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I do. For thousands of years the lowest classes of the human race have spent their lives labouring to erect monuments under the lash of their betters until finally they dropped down and became one with the dust through which they trudged. Do you have anything like that?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You know what? At least you guys did something. You know you you had a theory you wrote a paper you made an actual contribution. All guys like this do is just stand on other people\u2019s work."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Who died and made you king of moments?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Alright that\u2019s enough juvenile squabbling stop it stop it I say. I\u2019m going to settle this right now. Neither of you are good enough for my sister."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Forty-five."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh yes Leonard. Yes it was."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay. Ooh perhaps today is the day we finally find out what\u2019s inside the Magic Eight Ball."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Can you define the parameters of the kiss?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah. It\u2019s on the recommended reading list for my psychology class."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"But what about your time machine."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And to answer it we first must ask ourselves what is physics?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I never want this day to end."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What you\u2019re not my mother."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"intoxicating isn\u2019t it?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s actually not bad advice. You know I didn\u2019t seek out string theory. It just hit me over the head one day."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What\u2019s going on?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All your ideas address the issue at a university level. By then it\u2019s too late. You need to design an outreach program that targets girls at the middle school level and sets them on an academic track towards the hard sciences."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You know what? Screw you Sheldon. You are the most annoying person I have ever met."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I\u2019m sorry this does not look like Texas. Where\u2019s the tumbleweeds? Where\u2019s the saloons?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It\u2019s just a phone."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sorry guys. This club was so great how could they turn it into a bookstore? I thought we got rid of all those."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Straightening up."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh no pressure. Just get him a crummy card you\u2019re good."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh yeah I\u2019m wondering about that. You said it was working when you moved in."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And now for dessert come on hot fudge sundae come on hot fudge sundae. Bam! That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"If that\u2019s so what if I start talking to a girl?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yes. Pi."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What would a toilet look like in Atlantis? How would you flush it? And when you did flush it where would the poop go?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh boy a whole dollar. Now I can quit my paper route. So what\u2019s in it?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s still my turn."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Phone now."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes and do you know what the odds are I\u2019d pick your name?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Why would that make me feel better?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay yeah I kind of crossed a line. Put him back on."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No no that\u2019s not mine. It has a big spot on it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes. Why do you ask?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I didn\u2019t know what else to do. He had those big sad eyes."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes. I think you\u2019d like her. She\u2019s extremely intelligent just like you. Unlike you she\u2019s tall blonde and used to be an Olympic swimmer."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well you didn\u2019t specify."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It\u2019s true. I\u2019ve seen him at the beach he\u2019s like a human chicken wing."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wait! You bought me a present?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey. Oh I put your clothes in the dryer."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You\u2019re kidding."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh uh come in come in. Oh I uh I didn\u2019t think I was going to get to see you until tomorrow."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Just eat your tangerine chicken."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"She\u2019s gonna be okay; they\u2019re gonna let me take her home."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019ve always found that an inappropriate slur. Chickens are not by nature at all timid. In fact when I was young my neighbour\u2019s chicken got loose and chased me up the big elm tree in front of our house."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh I\u2019ve seen that look before. This is just going to be two weeks of moping and tedious emo songs and calling me to come down to pet stores to look at cats. I don\u2019t know if I can take it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well unless of course he\u2019s a skilled hypnotist."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Bark once if you need me to call PETA."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And now we\u2019ll never know."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well you skip over any attempt to repair your emotional connection and you win back her affection with an empty financial gesture."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay what kind of soup do you want."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Did you at least have a good flight down there?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"My limbic system wants to take your pants off."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"The box says kitchen."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Not at all."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And as an added bonus the word touch\u00e9 comes from fencing. It would be our only opportunity to use it in a non-metaphorical sense."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well he knew he was on the breast cam."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Unbelievable."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That was kind of icy. You two okay?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"We are. I mean he sleeps here. But it\u2019s only a matter of time before Sheldon has a bad dream and tries to climb into bed with the Leonard-shaped pile of pillows."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Listen guys I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t mean to be rude but I need to go call Raj\u2019s sister who I love so much. So vastly much."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sheldon do you understand the concept of blackmail?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Is it?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"The answer is cuddly soldiers with big flat noses. Moving on."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So he goes back into rehab?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"His mother?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh no. No. I\u2019ve already had to say good-bye to 11 Dr. Whos."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Pink wine and pizza bagels? It\u2019s like eighth grade all over again. I am so lucky to have you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay. Here we go. Proton decay. Proton decay.  Proton decay. Proton decay."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Thank you Internet. I\u2019m telling you with the right YouTube video I can give Howard a vasectomy."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Sheldon I\u2019m begging you. I want to go to this mixer and I don\u2019t want to go alone."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"As my relationships with Penny and Amy are currently strained I\u2019m turning to you for female comfort and encouragement."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Get out of town."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"He\u2019s right I was thinking of the lower flermin."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Perhaps two. I\u2019d like to master the craft."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I just got her a couple of things. She gives me things too."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I wish we could do more stuff without Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Please Bernadette. Let me leave with my dignity."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That I couldn\u2019t do it?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Easy. Sleeping with Penny."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh of course."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Please don\u2019t hurt my friend."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"When I take a girl out on a date and I do she knows she\u2019s been dated. Capital D. Bold face underline like Day-ted. I think I might have a little concussion I\u2019m going to go lay down for a while good night."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah no yeah wow I\u2019m sorry. That must\u2019ve been the last thing you wanted to hear."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay I am setting the dials for January 10th 2328. Here we go into the future.  That was fun."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You know I have a good mind to stop paying my taxes. It\u2019s too bad I enjoy doing them so much. The Air Force did it again. They\u2019re erasing our lives."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I believe what you\u2019re doing is using humour to avoid vulnerability."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You are. You don\u2019t get to decide when I\u2019m ready to say I love you!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Why don\u2019t I let my hair grow out? Um why don\u2019t I start wearing Birkenstocks and uh uh seeking validation of my opinions by asking can you dig it?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Don\u2019t know why he\u2019s so grumpy. I got mistaken for that guy in Life of Pi once and I\u2019m still floating."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"My spidey-sense tells me this has something to do with Penny."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"How dare you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I see."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I know. I can see the shadow of your feet under the door."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Uh probably. It\u2019s hard to say. She kind of had an ear of corn in her mouth."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"No you\u2019re displaying a shocking ignorance of the subject matter. Mummies and zombies are the exact same thing."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You did everything you could."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay here\u2019s the protocol you and I are still friends and you stop saying coitus."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Fine."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sorry he\u2019s really good."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Nevertheless this will be reflected in her tip."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"All right hang on. We can figure this out. Let\u2019s just go over your expenses. How much is your rent?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Really? The only thing I\u2019ve learned in the last two hours is that American men love drinking beer pee too often and have trouble getting erections."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah I know who he is. I watch Dancing with the Stars."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Wait what?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I open the chest."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Take off your clothes."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Which do you think she\u2019d prefer? Because I checked the Sheep and Wool Festival Web site and there\u2019s only 8000 tickets left."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Ah then you may find Zazzles a little cloying."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"That\u2019s great."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"That\u2019s what he said to me."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You\u2019re not helping."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Is the point that you don\u2019t know when to let something go?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Boy teenagers."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Ew."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay this place does look pretty good."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay I see where this is going. Fine I\u2019ll have sex with him."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Want some Chinese food?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Can I get anyone anything at all?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Don\u2019t forget his genetic predisposition towards addiction."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re healthy. You have a job in the sciences. I\u2019ve got to say if this credit report comes back good you\u2019re the frontrunner."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh good I got it right. Are you upset?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay wait are we talking one-night stand or do we want to get him into a relationship?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s awfully personal."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Look maybe it is a long shot but sometimes long shots happen. Luke Skywalker was only given one chance to destroy the Death Star. He had to get a torpedo into an exhaust port that was only two meters wide but with the help of The Force he\u2026 wow I can feel you hating me right now."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Pastries such as bearclaws?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hmm."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Mmm no it isn\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Why? You writing a book?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes and I have a theory why. Because of your lactose intolerance you switched over to soy milk. Soy contains estrogen-mimicking compounds. I think your morning Cocoa Puffs are turning you into a hysterical woman."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Just Bilbo Baggins\u2019 sword over there."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I know I know."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh. I\u2019m so sorry."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah. They do that when you set it on easy."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thanks."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You killed my pig?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah but what about the Chinese research team? They found it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh let\u2019s see how can I explain this um they don\u2019t know how to use their shields."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No backsies."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"If by cool you mean willing to yes. If by cool you mean cool clearly you\u2019ve never seen me play the cello."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No I don\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"This was nice."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I always tell people if you have only one day in Los Angeles make it a train day."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"A customer service representative with an Indian accent will create the impression we\u2019re a vast enterprise that uses overseas call centres."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You know right now at the back of this line there\u2019s a movie fan like you who\u2019s not going to get in because this person simply doesn\u2019t care. Yeah well 61 years ago there was another person at the back of the line and her name was Rosa Parks."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh yes. In fact he said I\u2019m fine I don\u2019t care. And he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Can I see your stitches?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"An orang-u-tan?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Penny meant if he were a purple leprechaun. Penny forgot to use the subjunctive."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No I do and that\u2019s why I hid it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You know Penny there\u2019s something that occurs in beehives you might find interesting. Occasionally a new queen will arrive while the old queen is still in power. When this happens the old queen must either locate to a new hive or engage in a battle to the death until only one queen remains."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"We\u2019re gonna have Anything Can Happen Thursday you\u2019re gonna tell me all about your science stuff and I\u2019m gonna complain about my movie and we\u2019re gonna support each other because that\u2019s what friends do."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I have to make pee-pee."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hold on. We do that all the time. You and I work together and play together."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hi."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m sorry what was that? I had a little stroke after oral."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Where?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"The living room appears to be empty."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Now that I\u2019m actually about to go out with Penny I\u2019m not excited I\u2019m nauseous."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Don\u2019t think like that you\u2019re not going to die alone."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey are we talking about me or are we talking about Thor?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Mother remember when I was complaining that you don\u2019t communicate with me enough?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah well when I die you can rent a bounce house."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well good job. Now she hates me. Ugh."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Look I care about you a lot but we are very different people."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"So we can communicate through the wall."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay we need to talk."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You know India?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh Hellblazer.

I picked the wrong day to wear my good robot T-shirt."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hawaii is a former leper colony on top of an active volcano where the disappointing ending to Lost was filmed. Mahalo for nothing Hawaii."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I did."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Sheldon if this is too much we can stop."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"We could call it Nuevo Cherusalem."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I sense you\u2019re making a joke but Bozeman does have a comedy club called The Loony Bin so do not forward my mail there."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m pretty sure her name\u2019s Lalita."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Great. That makes one of you. Okay we have a lot to do and not much time to do it. Bernadette you\u2019re on corn gravy and yam detail. Amy you\u2019re on rolls cranberries and making sure Bernadette stays away from the marshmallows. That\u2019s right I see you. Okay if you have any questions I\u2019ll be over here basting my ass off. Focus is key."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"And I told you he bit me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"This is not your office. It hasn\u2019t been assigned yet."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Great."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh I just ran out of patience with Sheldon\u2019s nonsense."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Whoa."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Whoa! That is very cool."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well yeah one of us has to keep an open mind."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hi. Sorry. Sheldon would like to say something to you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Now that Leonard\u2019s made me aware of how high the genetic stakes are we have to face the fact that none of you are suitable mates for my sister."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No I don\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"That\u2019s two dude. Write your own jokes."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Really? Great!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh sweetie you can\u2019t machine wash these. They\u2019ll be ruined."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019m telling you Leonard video slot machines free drinks brought to us by a bosomy barmaid and all you can eat shrimp for $3.95. Disneyland can suck it. This is the real happiest place on earth."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Ooh ooh it\u2019s the comic book store. All right come on that\u2019s where we have to go."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"She\u2019s not Catwoman she\u2019s just a generic cat."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay first off I want to thank you all so much for coming. Howard is here to interpret for Emily and to take notes."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Two."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I want a cookie Meemaw."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh hi."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What else do we know about him?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Run. Run run run. Don\u2019t look back."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Where did you get a ring?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So then during my afternoon shift I spilled an entire tray of drinks on myself."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Before you finish is this a story about patience and waiting or just another reminder that you went to space?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well hello."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And that\u2019s exactly what I did. I found a lot of someones."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh well my new friend\u2019s name was Eric. Um Amy lips tasted like the brownie we had for dessert. Oh and the banjo-playing conductor was missing a finger but he made up for it with his can-do attitude."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"More than anything."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"A successful quest. Now let\u2019s go find a gas station with a clean bathroom."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"There see? Problem solved."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay now I see the giant squid head. "},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Can you believe it\u2019s been eight years?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You own a smoking monkey?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh I am so sorry."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yeah screw it. I\u2019m going in."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh oh what about that tubby girl in the Sailor Moon costume at Comic-con?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah no one cares. Did you help me out or not?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey Howard I need to tell you something."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Toad of truth? Is that a physics thing?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t think thatqualifies as a mystery we all knew what we were doing."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I don\u2019t think this kind of wrestling has a bell."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Why did he think you\u2019re the lead scientist? It was my idea."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Twenty minutes a day completely unaccounted for."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Of course he\u2019s right. You and I both know how hard it is growing up without a father. That\u2019s why I\u2019m confident you\u2019re gonna be the best dad you can be."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Nothing with quarks."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Not bad? It\u2019s horrible. I mean you hear stories about this sort of thing but you never think it\u2019ll happen to you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No. Which will make me miserable which is usually Sheldon\u2019s job."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well I\u2019m sorry."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh Lord I think it\u2019s about to burst!  On the other hand it might have been the Brussels sprouts."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You know what? Fine. Do whatever you want."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Great.

See I will open her gift to me first and then excuse myself feigning digestive distress."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What? Why?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That\u2019s a lot of shoes you ordered."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It\u2019s okay. I can\u2019t get mad at your feelings."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Come on Mother you know why I can\u2019t accept the award. With all due respect I don\u2019t think praying will help.

And once a mind is pre-blown it cannot be re-blown."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"How about the girl from the Wonder Years?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Bartenders are supposed to have people skills."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Three four months."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh wow!"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Can I say I ruined you for white men?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"The guy\u2019s a genius.

Be part of that proud tradition."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What good is money gonna do if we inadvertently bring about Armageddon?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah I read your paper online.

Also pigs would fly my derriere would produce cotton candy and The Phantom Menace would be a timeless classic."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well I\u2019m not needed at both places at the same time. And I can also free up extra hours with simple tricks such as using a minimal amount of words to convey my point."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What heavy machinery?

Did you change the contrast or brightness settings on the television?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right we\u2019re going to be designing an experiment to look for the annihilation spectrum resulting from dark matter collisions in space."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah knock it off Howard."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Good morning everybody. I picked up coffee while I was out. Bernadette here\u2019s your soy peppermint mocha."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That\u2019s right. I\u2019m her change daddy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Remember when I said if you went through with your surgery there was a one-in-700000 chance of dying?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That\u2019s not ridiculous. Good night."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wait I need help getting down."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh dear. Two suns and no sunscreen."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay the final image is coming in. And the object we discovered is\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You okay?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wait no no. No. The word is Polish. See look. Polish sausage. And the the model of the solar system developed by Nicolaus Copernicus a Polish astronomer. And then finally if that wasn\u2019t enough which it should have been this is Madame Curie killing herself by discovering radium who although she was a naturalized French citizen was Polish by birth."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You do make a cute elf."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Just shut up Glen. Come on let\u2019s get out of here."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh. If I had one it would be Brown Dynamite."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So you\u2019re probably wondering what that was all about."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well why wouldn\u2019t this be a safe place? I mean he\u2019s surrounded by his wife and one of his best friends."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yeah. Come on I\u2019ll give you a ride."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay you guys had sex one whole time.

Please be good. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. She writes like she cooks."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"This is tough but I\u2019m going to say it\u2019s the guy who shows me YouTube videos of people getting hit in the nuts."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Eh his giant head did most of the work."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I think a more amusing violation of Raj\u2019s trust is when Howard convinced him that foreigners give presents to Americans on Thanksgiving."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah sure."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Maybe we should see how he\u2019s doing."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh no."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I will always have the dent to remember it by."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yeah great. Um I\u2019ll put food in her top half you deal with whatever comes out the bottom."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Excuse me I\u2019m sitting here."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Schooled!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh well then by all means carry on.

Dinner\u2019s almost ready."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Do you understand that Stephanie\u2019s not here to treat your imaginary ailments?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well he\u2019s my friend. It\u2019s what you do. "},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Because we just spent our allowance on comic books."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I would have included the others but you know exactly what would\u2019ve happened. They would\u2019ve taken over the project and bossed us around."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Sheldon tells it better."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh hell with Nebraska. I\u2019m gonna be a star!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh we got a sword and a plant our apartment\u2019s really shaping up."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No no I\u2019m good. If my P.E. teachers had told me this is what I was training for I would have tried a lot harder."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"That\u2019s a Hanukkah present you\u2019re regretting huh?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Thank you that\u2019s very gracious.     Gentlemen."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I miss you too. Hey this is good timing. Remember that Dr. Nowitzki I told you about? She\u2019s right here."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Some people might say it was romantic."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Why not? It seems like you\u2019re improvising your entire curriculum."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What am I supposed to do pretend I believe something I don\u2019t whenever I\u2019m with Penny?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Why would I touch her she\u2019s covered with airplane germs."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well you could be very frugal. I\u2019m getting a little tired of everybody\u2019s sarcasm."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh boy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You know when my grandfather died and Meemaw was alone my mom arranged for her to visit a centre three times a week where she could socialize with other lonely people. It\u2019s very nice. They discuss current events play bridge get a hot meal."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hi Leo how are you feeling?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Are you sure? Sometimes when my brain really gets moving it makes noise."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"A superb choice."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh Leonard was telling me about dark matter but I didn\u2019t really understand it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You\u2019re in a good mood."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s a small price to pay."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"We can drive there."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Are you trying to scare me? \u2018Cause you\u2019re succeeding."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"And I have to be honest I thought it was disturbing and weird and it made me wonder what it says about someone who enjoys it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Absolutely."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Are you kidding? He made me sign a waiver participate in an emergency fire drill and take a refresher course in CPR. Thank God he had a dummy."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You think we\u2019ll have time to visit your mom over there?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You know digital alcohol is never a solution. What\u2019s going on?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh it\u2019s quite straightforward actually. It describes a new model of the universe that conceptualizes it as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Please. Why would Leonard come home early and waste his time kissing Penny when he could be hanging out with his best buddy? Yeah that\u2019s it. I\u2019m catching her in the act. "},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Is there a history of heart disease in your family?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hang on. When is my pawn allowed to use the golf cart?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Amen to that. Sometimes I pour a little chardonnay into my dog\u2019s water bowl."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hi. You guys have a minute?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I don\u2019t get it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thank you. I appreciate that."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yes you can."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes. Actually I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. I\u2019m working on the Star Wars Day schedule. Now I have a window built in after Phantom Menace for complaining but I\u2019m worried an hour won\u2019t be enough time."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"This is exciting."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Really? I don\u2019t know where she\u2019d get an idea like that. You know Mummy and her crazy imagination I\u2019m so lucky I take after you."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Do you know any mining songs?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I just can\u2019t believe you don\u2019t trust me."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I know I know."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Can you give us a minute?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh great! now I have to start all over again. "},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I guess I could probably try a little harder."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well what do you think."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Why would we want to do that? It\u2019s called the comfort zone for a reason."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well no offence but I didn\u2019t go to art school. I have a PhD in astrophysics."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I don\u2019t understand. Why is it bad that you have to teach?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh not just something no. It\u2019s from the heart it\u2019s holiday-themed and I swallowed the gift receipt so you cannot return it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sorry. My apologies to the gay community of East Rutherford New Jersey."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I can never find the tiller. I got a book; it didn\u2019t help."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thanks."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Missy?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Wow."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Fine.  I don\u2019t think I can go much longer."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I suggest we treat our relationship as if it were a crashed computer and restore it to the last point we both agree it worked."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Don\u2019t you think we should tell him you\u2019re not interested?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Whoo-hoo!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Alright come on even you have to admit that\u2019s jibber-jabber."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No you did better than that you helped me see it on my own."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh my God oh my God oh my God."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"So uh what are you guys talking about?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Was the starfish wearing boxer shorts? Because you might have been watching Nickelodeon."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay who\u2019s ready for some science? Me too. Okay I am Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. I am here with my friends Dr. Cooper and real-life astronaut Howard Wolowitz and we are going to show you girls how cool a job in science can be. How cool you ask? Well how about negative 273 degrees \u2019cause that\u2019s the temperature at which entropy reaches its minimum value. Did I just learn something new and have fun doing it? What? All right. So now let\u2019s bring out theoretical physicist Dr. Sheldon Cooper."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Uh sweetie you do realize Thursday is Amy\u2019s birthday."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No and also I don\u2019t want to disappoint you. I you know come on it\u2019s your birthday. I can soldier through this."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What do you mean new roommate? What happened to Leonard?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes but what does it stand for?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh-huh."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What? This road trip just got crazy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t work here."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What are you saying? That I\u2019m using my body to get dinner? That I\u2019m some kind of Chinese food prostitute?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I hate to say it but she did kind of betray you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s not bold it\u2019s a mistake. I didn\u2019t change my status."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh no. A plaque? Nobody wants to see this."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Is there another Penny here? I had such plans. I had dreams. I was going to be the Indira Gandhi of particle astro-physics. But with a penis of course."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You don\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It\u2019s not about that."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"To do what?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What\u2019s going on?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"But then each of those people let someone cut?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Maybe it\u2019s just something minor. Ooh good news the light just went out."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hello Stuart."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I guess technically that was my fault.  I\u2019m not leaving here without Penny\u2019s money."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Don\u2019t patronise me just get the sword."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It means come in. It\u2019s taking forever to load the new operating system on my computer. I disinfected the kitchen and the bathroom and now I thought I\u2019d learn Finnish."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What are you guys talking about?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What about Leslie Winkle."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh cool."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No no I\u2019ve a bronze dagger."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That doesn\u2019t matter to me at all."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I couldn\u2019t poop this morning."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon this interview is supposed to be about me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh. Well good for you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"All right you brought this on yourself. Sheldon get him."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Go north. You can\u2019t go that way. Go west. A troll blocks your passage. Okay fasten your seatbelts kill troll. With what? With sword.  You don\u2019t have the sword. Good golly it\u2019s as if it\u2019s actually happening to me."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"That\u2019s cruel. You know it goes straight to my hips."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah it does and here we are."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s relatively new. I just know that I\u2019m not gonna spend time with someone I don\u2019t like simply to have a girlfriend. I\u2019m okay on my own."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Luminescence spell."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Ooh what are you gonna get?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Did you say it out loud with words?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Sorry. Sorry."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No you already threw up once. Go put on your PJs and brush your teeth."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Double guacamole?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t have a camera."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah! Dodgers are baseball right?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What does she want from me now?  What\u2019s up?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You\u2019re right. It should be a cuddly Asian boy. Like me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh look Saturn 3 is on."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Then why do you watch these things?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Really. Talk to me about that pocket watch."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"But you finished your experiment a week ago."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I guess my big problem is I never saw Leonard as the kind of guy who would do something like this."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Why? I really don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening here."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah it\u2019s crazy but it totally works. Look we made this Penny Blossom in under three minutes."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Let\u2019s try just walking out."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Aw."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You know it\u2019s been more than a year since I\u2019ve even kissed a girl?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"We believe cows are gods."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Please can I do it with him? Please?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That criticism will come later in your report card."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Fine go for a little walk."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It streams HD video straight to your phone while it\u2019s flying."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019d think a winner could make a decent cup of cocoa."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"He\u2019s not a barber he\u2019s the nephew. He\u2019s an example of the kind of nepotism that runs rampant in the barbering industry. Besides Mr. D\u2019Onofrio knows exactly how I like my hair done because he has all my haircut records from my barber in Texas."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I got you a talking Thomas the Tank Engine for Thanksgiving."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Just a couple of minutes. You\u2019ve really never done this before?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well then why don\u2019t you wear the rubber gloves I bought for you to do the dishes?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I know you\u2019ll try. So should we talk about setting a date?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"So if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it and either slit is observed it will not go through both slits. If it\u2019s unobserved it will however if it\u2019s observed after it\u2019s left the plane but before it hits its target it will not have gone through both slits."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"The Dark Knight has your back. He\u2019s scared but he has your back."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yes dinner\u2019s here and I\u2019m having some. I\u2019m having takeout food."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"And while you\u2019re at it I know that at this age your hormones are raging but just because all your friends are having sex doesn\u2019t mean you have to."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It is true that many of my heroes have taken students under their wings. Feynman Einstein Professor X. Humorously in the case of Professor X some of his students actually had wings. That\u2019s rich. I\u2019ll use that one to lighten the mood after my entire class fails the midterm."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well it\u2019s it\u2019s possible at absolute zero but we would have to remove the temperature restrictions."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Sorry doesn\u2019t make up for the fact that I had to make chicken and rice with this vegan guy. Do you know what vegan chicken and rice is? Rice!"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Why do you have a parking spot? You don\u2019t have a car. You don\u2019t even drive."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Doesn\u2019t like games. That\u2019s one."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Great."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey look who\u2019s here."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Holy crap."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I didn\u2019t care for her yelling. But now that I\u2019m not going to hear it again I\u2019m sad."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Just like Schrodinger\u2019s Cat your potential relationship with Leonard right now can be thought of as both good and bad. It is only by opening the box that you\u2019ll find out which it is."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes. From here on in I\u2019ve decided to make all trivial decisions with a throw of the dice thus freeing up my mind to do what it does best enlighten and amaze. Page 14 item seven."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It is. I feel alive."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"En garde Leonard. Prepare yourself for a rigorous touching."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I am facing a great deal of work. And I do like things better when famous people also like them."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Why?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You got it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So you\u2019re going to spend hours and hours combing through all this stuff?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So how do you feel? Nice and loose? Come to play? Got your game face on?  Are you ready?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"How\u2019d that work out for you?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hey. Listen to this. Murder cannibalism and satanic rituals are just a few of the thousand plus horrors that await."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh yes. Yeah and a fat lot of good it did me. All she did was get mad at you."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Ooh ooh! Do our babies will be smart and beautiful. That one always makes me laugh."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I don\u2019t know. I was just trying something."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay. Why?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Really?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I don\u2019t know. Where were we looking up at the night sky?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s fun while you\u2019re doing it. And then after it\u2019s mostly embarrassment self-loathing and regret."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well I suppose we could find a whole new place. You know and technically we don\u2019t even have to stay in Pasadena. We could we could move to Altadena or a place that doesn\u2019t even end in dena."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"This is all about listening and responding."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No not the Wesley Crushers. The Wesley \u201cCrushers.\u201d"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Really do tell."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No no no no no. I\u2019ve seen that movie. It\u2019s called Iron Man."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You don\u2019t want that do you?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh okay great. But if we\u2019re really gonna do a double date then we have to go over some ground rules about Emily."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"He probably just goes to the bathroom."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"From an orang-u-tan in the primate lab."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Do you know there are only eight consonants in the Hawaiian language."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"While my brother and sister are mouth-breathing idiots."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah. Although when he was trying to figure out the tip I\u2019m pretty sure I saw smoke coming out of his ears. You\u2019re not really considering working for him are you?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No no th-th-th-that can\u2019t be right. I-I don\u2019t make arithmetic mistakes."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well I\u2019d like to point out I voted for orang-utan but you shouted me down. ."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You think he bites?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Can you believe how pushy she is?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You guys don\u2019t have to go to the trouble. I\u2019m back in the money now I can just buy another helicopter."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You look you look really pretty tonight."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"None?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No it\u2019s okay. We\u2019re all adults trying to have an intelligent discussion. At least I am. Howard what do you think?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Then to avoid Jewish hell?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh please. I have ideas all day long. Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins are allowed to pet people. A new clothing size between medium and large called Marge. Snow White retold from the point of view of Sneezy. Why won\u2019t Doc prescribe him something? We finally find out."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh it\u2019s no problem. It\u2019s actually kind of nice. You reading me reading. We\u2019re like an old married couple."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh my. What an honour. Oh this is like being asked to ascend Mount Olympus and dine with the gods."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It\u2019s not just the kite thing. Every time we go some place you think you can just dump me whenever someone prettier comes along even though you don\u2019t have a shot with them."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh true. They\u2019re practically giving them away. You know in exchange for money."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the Sun\u2019s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow effects your personality."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t know the first thing about women but I would not follow her."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Why?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Do you know I\u2019ve corresponded with Peter Higgs. Would you like to see some of his letters?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Emily your face is like a precious dew-kissed flower."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It\u2019s interesting your father didn\u2019t help around the house and Howard doesn\u2019t help either so in a way Howard\u2019s not only like your father but he\u2019s also like the child that you\u2019re afraid to have."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Get out."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t think I can go out with her tonight."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Personally I find the notion of external rewards demeaning. I pursue science for the intrinsic joy of discovery."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I think the word you\u2019re looking for is befuddled."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hold on. I see what\u2019s wrong here. We did the propagation only to the occipital lobe not to the prefrontal cortex."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well have a lovely evening."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I still don\u2019t understand why you bought that pill caddie. You\u2019re a young man."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"That\u2019s what I said when we moved it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You went to the comic-book store by yourself?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh pause it. That\u2019s it. Confirmed. We now have the address of the top model house."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Bert has a room for rent."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Now that I know she doesn\u2019t like me I\u2019m kind of into her."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah Amy just one second. Meeting."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I don\u2019t know but I\u2019d like to get lost in her Bermuda Triangle."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"No no not like Haroun and Tanweer."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What can I do? I can\u2019t stop thinking about her."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Ooh ooh. Did the pigeon on your windowsill have more babies?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You know what I give up. He\u2019s impossible."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I asked you over and over if you were okay. Why would you go through with the wedding if you weren\u2019t?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I don\u2019t see how I could."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sir uh if I may uh we\u2019ve put a lot of thought and effort into this current prototype. It\u2019s a really elegant solution and most importantly it works."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No of course not. Okay look instead of fighting why don\u2019t we dim the lights um get naked and make a baby? I was trying to lighten the mood. It\u2019s not easy. You try it."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"On the one hand if I say yes\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh Doctor Hofstadter it\u2019s so good to see you again."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"So Penny has a don\u2019t knock on my door before eleven o\u2019clock  or I punch you in the throat rule."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"She\u2019s younger and far more attractive than he is. They\u2019re copying you two."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh. Then what was last night about?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hello."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"All right. Well we\u2019ll just pretend that you didn\u2019t catch a cold watching Frozen."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh that\u2019s a nice offer."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Really? Do we do that?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"How do you deal with the success of your colleagues?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Don\u2019t you like Amy?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"How about that? Einstein was wrong."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You fooled me with that goat at the petting zoo. You will not fool me again."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"As a cooling solution it\u2019s pretty cool."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I don\u2019t need your help deciding when we need help!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Rough night Casey Jones?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Don\u2019t read those letters!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I bet he\u2019s someone from Babylon 5 we\u2019re never going to guess."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey! That\u2019s my sister and my country you\u2019re talking about. Leonard may have defiled one but I won\u2019t have you talking smack about the other."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay. On the count of three I\u2019ll shoot the fire extinguisher and get him airborne. Howard you wave the blanket and guide him towards the exit. Raj you hold open the curtain so he can fly out."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"No no it\u2019s a very promising area. In a perfect world I\u2019d spend several more years on it. But I just couldn\u2019t pass up the opportunity to work with you on your tremendously exciting and not yet conclusively disproved hypothesis."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Give it a second. "},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019m looking to make extra money and was wondering if you had any chores I could do."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well? What do you think of New Comic Book Night? Magic huh?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Is it Eddie Crispo?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Uh heads up both of you are named Emily so we\u2019ll call you red-headed Emily and you red-headed Emily Junior."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"So while I\u2019m waiting for this mysterious perfect match who may or may not exist I\u2019m supposed to just be alone."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right that\u2019s it. Who Con you\u2019re out."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Why are you doing that?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I can\u2019t do anything right for you can I?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What\u2019s the matter?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Do you think I\u2019m feminine?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh okay it\u2019s not important. It can wait."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You you dirty birdie. I-I thought about the things you said to me yesterday and I realized I\u2019m deeply offended. Now be a dear and get me one of those complaint forms."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So Amy I\u2019ve been wondering are you and Sheldon going to be sharing a room?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh then I\u2019m out."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sure you did."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay. Yet he cried when they changed the Raisin Bran box."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You know I used to hate these hugs. Now they\u2019re just extremely irritating."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah yeah me and Zack again."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And may I point out it is the three of you who are obsessed with Stuart and Amy not me. I think you need to ask yourselves who\u2019s really being ridiculous here. "},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s gonna be hard to find something you\u2019re both equally good at."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019ve been studying how to make people laugh. They say that comedy is tragedy plus time. Let\u2019s tickle some ribs."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Sorry."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah great."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Excuse us for a second. Sheldon it\u2019s okay he can do it. He\u2019s a barber."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I want oatmeal."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Please pester her. Please for me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Aquaman protecting your home since 2012."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Come on but if you don\u2019t stay awake we\u2019ll never finish in time."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Maybe."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It wasn\u2019t a breakup. A breakup would imply that Amy was my girlfriend."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Aw."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"They are pants one wears over one\u2019s regular pants when one sits on bus seats that other people have previously sat on. But perhaps from your lofty heights atop the corporate ladder you\u2019ve lost touch with the struggles of the common man."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I want her to feel at home. I also bought scented soaps pantyhose Midol calcium chews and what is apparently a yogurt specifically designed to regulate the female bowel."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Probably because I didn\u2019t read the instructions. No wrapper\u2019s going to tell me what to do. Unless his name is Jay-Z."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Don\u2019t worry I\u2019m a grown man. I have a thick skin."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh nice to meet you Mr. Insightful."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay well I\u2019ll apologize for the first time but the other nine are on you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well what am I supposed to say stop having fun without me?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"37."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And you\u2019re worried that turkey neck is in your future. What now see now it says you\u2019re mad. Make up your mind."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Not for long."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Making great time. Gonna be there pretty early."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yep I don\u2019t see any way around it."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"No I was svelte as a gazelle. A gazelle blessed with a flair for storytelling."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"The cosmological physicist from Princeton?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well I trusted you and you let me down. The poor thing\u2019s been shaking for hours."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I\u2019m just saying that after everything you\u2019ve been through you get to look into each other\u2019s eyes and say \u201cI love you.\u201d And that\u2019s beautiful."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I think her weekend just opened up."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Wow you look amazing."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No but she might think I think it\u2019s a date even though I don\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m not sure that I do. Um is that one thirty-six hour experience or is it thirty six hours spread out over say one\u2026 glorious summer."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Really? I once saw him shopping at Ralph\u2019s. He was buying tequila."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Click it with me. One two three click."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Mango caterpillar. What are you doing? You said you liked it!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well those are indicators that I\u2019m farther along the evolutionary scale than the average human."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I bought the first one it didn\u2019t fall."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wait if Howard\u2019s mother is coming then you should also steal marbles. Because she\u2019s obese and hippos are obese and in the popular board game Hungry Hungry Hippos they eat marbles. Maybe I need to dumb these down for you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s why it\u2019s guarded by snakes. Take some."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"This party is just going to suck."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"He\u2019s afraid the original owners will come back."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hmm. You know perhaps instead of confronting them we should see how far they\u2019re willing to spin their tangled webs. Like that Spider-Man action figure that used to be on your desk."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Wow. That\u2019s rough."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"June 30th 2004. Opening day of Spider-man 2 at the AMC Pasadena. They only had red icees no blue."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon everybody takes vacations."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh great my rhinestones. Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Really you want me to sing Soft Kitty to a computer monitor?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"And you guys aren\u2019t going? I can\u2019t believe you Raj is celebrating a tremendous accomplishment and you\u2019re not even going to be there to support him?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I know what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re trying to get attention so we\u2019ll feel bad for you but it\u2019s not happening."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So how\u2019s it going?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"My name is Little Orphan Annie. You killed my father. Prepare to die."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Can we talk about this later."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"So what do you gals do?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No thank you. And thank you ordinary person. Hey you want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh good good."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m not hitting on her."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon this is crazy."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah probably with a blow-up doll."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Perfect for the night I\u2019m having. Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard have you ever wondered why my little toes and lateral incisors are significantly smaller than the average for someone of my size?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s what I said."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s axiomatically atypical. Up until recently they did not know Alicia and had no encounters with her in a previous location. They never went upstairs to visit the former tenants so your characterization of their behaviour as typical Is demonstrably fallacious."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay. What is your game?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Come on Sheldon the world is filled with people doing things outside. Let\u2019s go outside. Outside is good."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Fine. You\u2019re in Sheldon Square."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Knock knock."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Believe it or not Amy has embarked on a campaign to increase my feelings for her by making me happy."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It was lovely meeting you best of luck in your future endeavours."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay when you say make the best of it."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"She\u2019s kind of a mean drunk but what are you gonna do?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Me neither. Oh Sheldon seemed think that I would be upset about you hanging out with him. But I just want you to know it\u2019s fine."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What are negs?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Can you please come get him?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay back to the ring. Does Amy even know about this?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What do you want Sheldon?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh is it okay?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well yeah no I met the huge ex-boyfriend and the smaller yet still larger than me ex-boyfriend. Were they here today?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Don\u2019t forget the mail you took accidentally on purpose so you\u2019d have an excuse to talk to her."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey you\u2019re early. The movie doesn\u2019t start for an hour."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hold on. I\u2019m talking to an orc under the bridge in Thunder Bluff who says if we pay him he\u2019ll help us track down your things."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Ooh Hallow-weenies! That\u2019s a good one. They\u2019ll pair nicely with my Draculoni and Cheese. How do I do it?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah no problem."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"If I could keep my Gmail account I\u2019d be okay with that."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What? Don\u2019t send me home. I can\u2019t be alone right now."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"My money\u2019s on tuck and roll."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Leonard help."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m sorry too."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That seems like a bit of an overreaction."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s getting pretty late how come you\u2019re still up?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Mmm the nurse is a woman so he couldn\u2019t talk to her. She had to bring him a Grover puppet so he could point at what hurt."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well uh they shifted my schedule around at the restaurant so my hours are going to be a little different\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hello-lo-lo."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m really starting to think there\u2019s a double standard here."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh no no no. No I\u2019ve too much to do."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Who\u2019s trying to seduce you? After a long day I always turn on smooth jazz and spray deer musk on my inner thighs."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"An hour? What? That\u2019s crazy. We have a reservation."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Come on be serious."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yes you are. You always overthink things."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sheldon I am very very sorry."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Do you really think you should be eating that cake?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No. But we have potatoes I could make you vodka. It\u2019ll take two weeks."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh dear lord."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Wait what is wrong with you two? He was talking about television during their date night."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Cut. Did you not see we are rolling?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Penny got it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just he\u2019s so passionate about so many different things. I just don\u2019t get that way. Do you?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh like Attack of the Clones. We are leaving right now."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes. Kardashian."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"We can but for the record all chaps are assless."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Here see if this one works."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"They\u2019ve been out there a while."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Good luck. I threw out all my tall ones when I married Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That is unbelievable. Good for Bert."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Don\u2019t make this harder than it is Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Is it racist that I took you to an Indian restaurant?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Penny have you seen my good inhaler?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"We were badass back in the day."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You know what that\u2019s great. I love that."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"A sports metaphor?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And I you. And yes that\u2019s how you say that. Yeah so given our newfound intimacy I\u2019d say we have some hard choices to make."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh see? Now he gets it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No you\u2019re right you shouldn\u2019t talk to him. I will."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And his last meal was a food pellet? You\u2019re a monster."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"All right I\u2019ve got your back."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I well I see her around. I like to keep my distance because her boyfriend is a pretty scary dude."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I still keep thinking about how an entire life can seemingly amount to nothing."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah. He was kinda dreamy."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey the jaw wants what it wants."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Let me ask you a question. Do you believe you\u2019re going to go to hell for eating sweet and sour pork?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No sexy cop. Slutty cop only came with a skirt and two badges."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh come on Leonard! This is obviously about Penny."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Leonard I\u2019m not gonna call up Kurt and ask him for money."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You\u2019re paying? Have you been selling your sperm again?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No I was gonna grab Raj and Howard and have a good time."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"When are you going to stop making Cylon toast?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hey you taught me something. Who would have thought it?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well if you want romance then let\u2019s have romance. Oh look there\u2019s wine. Mmm. Grape juice that burns. Uh now let\u2019s gaze into each other\u2019s eyes hmm? You blinked. I win."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hey. Yeah. Hey sorry if last night was awkward."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I will. Hey Bernadette?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I liked it better when you thought I wasn\u2019t here."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Excuse me. Before this evening goes any further we need to decide where everyone is going to sit."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh he was up late last night so I gave him an early dinner and put him to bed."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well for a while. Then he comes back."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Have you guys seen this feature that lets you talk to Siri without pressing any buttons?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh friggety-frak. Not this again."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh hi Penny!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard! If I\u2019m going to get ahead of this thing I need to find out what\u2019s growing in my throat."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"How is that both our names?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That lecture was a waste of time. I made more accurate diagrams of the expansion of the early universe on the nursery wall with the contents of my diaper. "},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Do something."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Guava?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah sure."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Outside? I just made cocoa."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No we\u2019re not. We\u2019re standing in the hallway suffering through an awkward encounter."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Actually you can\u2019t have that one either. It\u2019s too good. Sorry."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well if that\u2019s the case Penny will have to get satellite TV and maybe once a week run a vacuum through this place."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"We\u2019re scientists. We observe everything. Here go buy yourself a scone."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh boy Sheldon\u2019s going to freak out."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So things started to turn around?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What about comic-books?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Your mom still here?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Double potion please."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Bam."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey Penny and I are gonna go shop for a dining room table. You want to come with us?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I know you are. That\u2019s why you just bought me a new iPad. And before you start I am not interested in you arranging a marriage for me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh you have shoes you love but never wear. I have money I love but never spend. We\u2019re kind of a cute couple that way. Again I\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have kept it a secret."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You\u2019re kidding right?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay just one question. What?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"That\u2019s Howard\u2019s cousin that he had sex with."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"And this is Leonard this is Penny."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Sorry? That\u2019s all you can say is sorry?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Would you like to be?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"In the words of Khan Noonien Singh in the immortal wrath of Khan he tasks me he tasks me and I shall have him."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Statistically unlikely."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Terrific."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Great. Now this may look like a Tic Tac but it is really a powerful medication specifically designed to cure your illness as well as freshen your breath."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Alright please don\u2019t cheer me up anymore."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Still don\u2019t get it."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh dude you are never getting a shiksa goddess."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You okay? It\u2019s you. You\u2019re you\u2019re next."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Sheesh."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Wait Leonard he\u2019s hurting. Let him feel how he feels."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m very very sorry."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No no we\u2019re living together now everything\u2019s equal. You know? I know that I have a tendency to be controlling so I would rather you choose."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What are you doing?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well what if I spill tomato soup on my shirt and have to come home to change only to find there\u2019s no water for an enzyme soak."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right Elizabeth the bathroom is yours. The seat is down and has been sanitized for your protection."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yes but I\u2019m finding that having a lackey suits me."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"We don\u2019t have any of those."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well let\u2019s see. Yup three missed calls."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I am forgetting nothing and I resent your tone."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No no. My point is uh tonight is Sheldon\u2019s first official date. Discuss."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Chaos theory suggests that even in a deterministic system if the equations describing its behaviour are non-linear a tiny change in the initial conditions can lead to a cataclysmic and unpredictable result."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"We might as well stop it\u2019s a stalemate. You\u2019re beating me in tetris but you\u2019ve got the upper body strength of a Keebler Elf."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You\u2019re gonna put alcohol in the punch?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"This is ridiculous. You\u2019re just making stuff up."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What? That\u2019s absurd. Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Is that a relevant factor?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Happy birthday buddy."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"All I said was she seems nice."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Of course not. No. Why?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Don\u2019t you have any friends he can date?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh Leonard you know I can\u2019t do that."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Wow it\u2019s so cute."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What do you want mom?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Guys have you seen Stuart all up in Penny\u2019s business over there?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Are you drunk?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Notice people on your own time. We\u2019re working."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No it\u2019s just something I threw on."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Wait where are you going? We were doing so well. She never even got to see my penis. Ta-da!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Fine."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m telling you you can\u2019t create love in a few hours. Right?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Actually I meant you could drive me. But if it makes you happy that other stuff too."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"So I thought the photo booth for the party could either be creepy like a mummy\u2019s tomb or they also have the Tardis from Doctor Who."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You want to be green?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Section 74.C. The various obligations and duties of the parties in the event one of them becomes a robot."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Why would she even do this?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well I just met her gynaecologist!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hi Tom. Sheldon? Didn\u2019t I explain to you about your little mistake in the cafeteria?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well you got me out of my pants."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You get to choose between a mountain bike or a PS3."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I don\u2019t get it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah you and me both sister. Now please understand I don\u2019t hold you responsible for your behaviour because see from an evolutionary standpoint you\u2019re a slave to your desire to reproduce. But during the work day when you feel possessed by amorous intent may I suggest that you suppress it by leafing through this illustrated book of sexually transmitted diseases? Let\u2019s see here. Oh yes. Check out this oozy doozy."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I don\u2019t know."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh I\u2019m getting a bad feeling."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"No one\u2019s arguing with you dude."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon dinner\u2019s here."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh I\u2019m sorry to hear that."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh and no contact with guinea pigs or hamsters or their droppings uh no-no cat litter boxes no paint fumes."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I was thinking it might be some sort of interstellar coordinate system maybe an updated version of Hubble\u2019s law. I keep seeing the number 90 repeating. That could be the angle of perturbation of a distant galaxy."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Nice."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"All I\u2019ve got is a needler and I\u2019m all out of ammo."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Mother I have to go. Yeah love you. Bye.  Daddy\u2019s home."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That show ended with all the residents of New York either dead or unconscious. Oh now I\u2019ll never know what happened."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh that\u2019s just a doodle of a hyperelliptic Riemann surface."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It\u2019s okay I\u2019m fine."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No kidding?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Uh yeah sorry. She\u2019s just a little shy. The first time we met she was so nervous she climbed out a bathroom window to get away from me."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019m sorry. Honestly I didn\u2019t think your job would bother me but I guess it did. And I hate myself for that. But there\u2019s a lot of things about me that would totally embarrass you."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"That sounds really cool."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well if anyone\u2019s interested I\u2019ll be spending this Valentine\u2019s Day the same way I spend every Valentine\u2019s Day. Buying a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket taking it home standing over the sink and eating it out of the package with my bare hands like an animal."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"A total loser. Obviously a guy with a six-shooter beats an old man with a magic wand."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay Raj here you go. Alright who\u2019s next?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"If you were me would you kiss her?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What ya doing Skippy?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah. Well Sheldon\u2019s not here."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Did he Purell?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That would be ideal. If a person like that existed I would sign on no further questions asked."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I bought him dinner and we kissed once that was it.  And he told me his name was Kimberley!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh yeah there she is. Hi Mom."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sure that has birds in it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Why are you mad at me? You\u2019re the one that did the stupid thing. I\u2019m just trying to fix it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes there is.

She and I once had a staring contest. She clapped really loud and made me blink. It\u2019s a small leap from there to sexual infidelity."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Shooting at a target?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"If you\u2019re concerned about sharing credit with me you\u2019re name can go first\u2026 I\u2019m going."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sounds yummy.

Need I go on?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh come on I hardly ever get a chance to play anymore."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well she doesn\u2019t care for hotels. And who can blame her? Windows that don\u2019t open multi-user linens keys shaped like credit cards as if one walks around with unassigned slots in one\u2019s wallet. All right I believe I have time for one more question. Yes Raj?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes. Oh for example three years ago when I discovered Penny was eating all my Pop-Tarts instead of getting angry or vindictive you know I got a floor safe."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"But what if we can\u2019t?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What\u2019s wrong with you?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Thank you.

If I\u2019m to participate in the social convention that is the stag night then I must embrace all its components including tobacco swear words and yes alcohol. Jeepers!

That\u2019s two proposals one day. Sounds like someone wants to spend the rest of her life telling people how to spell the name Hofstadter."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019m not surprised. Despite his hard and crusty shell Howard is a very sensitive man. Do you know he writes poetry? Mostly about men from Nantucket and hermits named Dave but he does it with real sensitivity."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh. Football sure."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Totally you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Look I admit it I may have crossed a line here but come on Raj your sister is a grown woman.

Everybody gets behind on their bills."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t care for novelty editions of Monopoly. I prefer the classics regular and Klingon."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So you\u2019re gonna throw me under the bus?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh yes like the male peacock with brilliant plumage or the rutting baboon with engorged hindquarters."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I don\u2019t think this kind of wrestling has a bell."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Good morning. Is there some new kind of casual Friday I don\u2019t know about?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No problem."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah. You got a problem with that?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"More than we can use. You see in India we don\u2019t make the mistake of letting our poor people have dreams."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I was 16 in Nebraska. What do you think?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"In case you didn\u2019t follow that I\u2019m the coffee."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019ll pay you 40 dollars."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay. I think this will be my seat."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Mrs. Cooper we say Catholics not rosary rattlers."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Correction. Missy can date whoever she wants."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"No thank you. I\u2019m fine."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I turn into a bear?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Really?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t know. A music-loving hobo with a heart of gold?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Ah well in this context\u2026 "},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay where is he going?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"No wait the evening\u2019s not over."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I think we should see other people."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s mighty sassy for a man with a roommate performance review around the corner."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No not at all. Let me help you with this stuff."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Terrific."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Of course I can\u2019t mention you in my Nobel acceptance speech but when I get round to writing my memoirs you can expect a very effusive footnote and perhaps a signed copy."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No problem. Um so listen I don\u2019t know if you have any plans next weekend but I kind of promised your mom we\u2019d have another wedding ceremony so she could attend this time."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well my new shoes are not made for running."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Easy easy  Okay! Now we\u2019ve got an inclined plane. The force required to lift is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs call it thirty degrees so about half."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay I\u2019ll go. Never have I ever been arrested."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh thank you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"So I did a little research on what the conditions are like in the mines and the guys might be right sounds pretty rough down there. For starters it\u2019s very humid and about a hundred degrees."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh thank you and I\u2019m sorry I lied about it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh no. Why?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Baby."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh. Wow. Okay. Let\u2019s see. We\u2019ve got uh milk chocolate Swiss cheese fondue. My lactose-intolerant boyfriend is going to eat all this then I\u2019m going to climb on his back and rocket to the moon?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah go ahead."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh five more minutes."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s this Jimmy Speckerman thing. I can\u2019t decide if I should agree to see him or not. Of course that might be because the last time I ran into him he made me floss with my own shoelaces."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So hey I was thinking about that stuff with Alex."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You want to watch Battlestar?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Uh I\u2019d say by three."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah okay I think this ends the ex-boyfriend portion of our evening."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Very well. Hey Comic-Con tickets go on sale this Friday. You can\u2019t buy one."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No. But it does involve air travel. Okay um let me slice this Swiss cheese with my Swiss army knife and then you can wash it down with a cup of Swiss Miss instant cocoa."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah. Did you notice all the people looking at us?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well I think we should show what earthlings look like."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Guys have you seen Stuart all up in Penny\u2019s business over there?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh I\u2019m so sorry I\u2019m such a mess and on top of everything else I\u2019m all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesn\u2019t even work."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh Penny. I know you think you\u2019re being generous but the foundation of gift-giving is reciprocity. You haven\u2019t given me a gift you\u2019ve given me an obligation."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You know this reminds me of high school."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You might want to slow down a bit buddy."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh my God. Yes. Why would you even ask that?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Get out here! Your mommy wants to talk to you!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sheldon you are a smart guy you must know\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Did you start waxing?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Who are you kidding? You were so panicked Leonard was gonna die you\u2019ll never leave him."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That\u2019ll be all. That was fun."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I need to see it. While I\u2019m gone don\u2019t breathe on my pillow."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"How about that guy? He looks like he\u2019d hate you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Did you guys have an argument?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What now you\u2019re interested? You didn\u2019t even want to come."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"My my. The plot like my gravy thickens."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wouldn\u2019t you like to know?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"How are we going to get it upstairs?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh please. I don\u2019t remember the episode of Star Trek where the guy never goes to space and brags about it in a tuxedo store."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Really?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I suppose. I do miss whistling though."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You know she\u2019s my mother-in-law. Why can\u2019t I bond with her like that?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I stopped counting at four."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Penny this is Raj\u2019s sister Priya."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Absolutely.  Oh bite me!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh Lord will this day never end? As I\u2019ve explained repeatedly to Dr. Koothrappali whose ability to comprehend the American idiom fails him when it\u2019s convenient there\u2019s absolutely no money in my budget for additional office furniture."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No I know I got that. Yeah totally."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Mmm these are so good"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I can\u2019t believe I read this table wrong. I blame you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Good to know."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"That is one tough birdie."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah. I\u2019m tapping out. Leonard?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m not talking to you like you\u2019re an idiot! I\u2019m saying the whole idea is idiotic!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I wonder if we\u2019d have to disclose something like this when we apply for grants."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh come on. You deserve one. You\u2019ve worked hard to find a woman who makes a lot of money."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"My mother would lock her car doors if she had to drive through this hodgepodge of ethnicity."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah beam me up. I love it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t want the next level. I like this level. Fix it for me!"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hello."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Because he\u2019s hard to find. If he was easy to find the books would be called There\u2019s Waldo."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Maybe this isn\u2019t a good time."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh am I talking too much? I\u2019m sorry. Zip."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"If that happens don\u2019t make me wait ten years to watch you eat a tin can."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No it doesn\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"If it helps I\u2019m questioning your life choices too."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I am making her comfortable. Besides she\u2019s not sleeping here half the time anyway."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh. Very clever. But still racist."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hello? They gave me a Band-Aid. Hospitals do not issue Band-Aids unless it is medically necessary. That is the law."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hey."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"So you\u2019d do a striptease?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Thank you but cute is for bunnies. I want to be something with sex appeal like like a labradoodle."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah I like hanging out with you guys."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right. Can I help you?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Buddy I don\u2019t think you can. I mean once it\u2019s out there it\u2019s out there. This thing is like the science equivalent of a sex tape."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well I\u2019d give more examples but well everyone in your position\u2019s so forgettable."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No. Isaac goes at the top of the tree."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh that\u2019s a paradox. I mean if you meant what you just said then that means you may not have meant what you just said."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You know what I mean. And you know maybe the way I\u2019ve been reacting was me sabotaging this too."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It\u2019s very simple. For breakfast she has an egg-white frittata. Feel free to give her a choice of home fries or an English muffin but not both. We\u2019re watching our weight. Uh for dinner something simple a veal chop some scampi whatever you like."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Before I answer was he a smoker? I think you\u2019re looking at this all wrong."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"No. But it\u2019s a stupid test."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Damn this is hard. "},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t need any insights. I just want to know why Penny\u2019s more interested in Stuart than me. We\u2019re practically the same guy."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t care."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hey Sheldon you busy?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I think you made that very clear."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You know I can\u2019t keep a secret."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I don\u2019t want to celebrate."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Will do."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh what\u2019s so gothic about vodka and cranberry juice?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh I kind of told her I was working."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Really oh yay!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sorry Raj my mind is made up."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s okay."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Don\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay partner let\u2019s do it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh listen I heard that Bernadette\u2019s thinking about asking you for a pre-nup."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah except for the fact that Indiana Jones is completely irrelevant to the story. With or without him the Nazis find the ark open it and die."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Excuse me but I think we\u2019ve both found that helpful at times."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh-huh."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Say yes."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What are you guys gonna do?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah I\u2019m sorry too. We\u2019re about to share the rest of our lives together. It\u2019s our money who cares who has it?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay I have pokh."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Howard is a complete and total ass Bernadette is in Penny\u2019s bed Amy bites and Penny may or may not have coitus with Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Do you realise I may have to share a Nobel Prize with your booty call?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"That\u2019s fine. She and I can cry together."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey. Is everyone getting to know each other?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh quick sit."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Really?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon. We are dealing with an impossible deadline from the Air Force because of you. So have an energy drink don\u2019t have an energy drink. Order suppositories and shove \u2019em wherever you want I don\u2019t care."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Or we could talk to this guy he used to share an office with."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Ugh what can you do? Here. "},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"That was pretty badass dude."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hi."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So you\u2019re upset about missing out on becoming some sort of freakish self-aware robot?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t have epilepsy either."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Please come in."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey what you doing Quick Draw?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"But it is what you got me last year."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m sorry no."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I enjoy marching bands and Tibetan throat singing."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah you guys run to the store and let the women handle the science for a change."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Unless you want to be Cinderella."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I realize it\u2019s irrational but with Raj moving in there I\u2019m feeling a bit replaced."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Who\u2019s killing the mood now?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"That\u2019s incredible. Oh here break out the math."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Laura."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Boy oh boy. This vacation is off to a wonderful start. The smell of formaldehyde the whir of the centrifuge the distant chatter of lab animals being dispatched for dissection. Mm I can already feel my cares just melting away."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"How can you be sure? VHS was king when Feynman drove this van. For all we know there are hidden compartments lousy with Jane Fonda workout videos."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh I was hoping for a juicy tidbit about Ron Perlman\u2019s testicles."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019d love to but I don\u2019t have tangerine chicken."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t believe it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay I\u2019ll talk to her later. Uh Dad there\u2019s something I need to tell you. Leonard and I got married."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh we could run a pattern-matching algorithm against well-known unsolved physics problems."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Good morning Amy."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"See you guys at work."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Wait a minute what are you talking about? What inappropriate behaviour?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Of course. What?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Peering through his telescope at the birth of the cosmos."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Holy crap!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Good for you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I suppose I should set this up. Or would you like to rob me of that too?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Really? Did you just have the Nobel Prize in waitressing stolen from you?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Listen I\u2019m sorry about all of Sheldon\u2019s interruptions he can be a bit of an eccentric."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah why?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"It was a long story. Anyway Sheldon I promise I know what I\u2019m doing. Please let me cut your hair."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Good one."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Leonard you are really not cheering me up."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Nothing really. It was just kissing."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh. Mine was Winnie the Pooh. But anyway why don\u2019t we just take a step back and start with a colour? Right? There are so many amazing ones. Red blue green purple."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You know what? I am ending this. Penny didn\u2019t want to hold the ring anymore. She gave it to me I have it. I\u2019m sending it back. Where\u2019s the ring?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Why would you buy peppermint schnapps?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I don\u2019t know if I want to play anymore."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Fine. If I don\u2019t meet someone soon you can put me in a home."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well I can\u2019t believe you\u2019d say that. You know how insecure I am about my insecurities."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh fine. You know it\u2019s been a while. I\u2019m getting back out there."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hi. Hello. Oh and a special hello to Leonard who needs to be mentioned by name."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Howard what do you think?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Thank you Leonard. What\u2019s my share?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I didn\u2019t have clams."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I got your back."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What did I ever do to Jimmy Mullins in the third grade? He still punched me in the face with my own fists. Sorry you little nerd you were just in the wrong boys\u2019 room at the wrong time."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Penny got it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay feeling the awkward now."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Fine I\u2019ll do it in English but it loses something. The need to find another human being to share one\u2019s life with has always puzzled me. Maybe because I\u2019m so interesting all by myself. With that being said may you find as much happiness with each other as I find on my own. The Klingon would have made you cry."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s very simple. Look scissors cuts paper. Paper covers rock. Rock crushes lizard. Lizard poisons Spock. Spock smashes scissors. Scissors decapitates lizard. Lizard eats paper. Paper disproves Spock. Spock vaporizes rock. And as it always has rock crushes scissors."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"GPS says we\u2019ll be at the railway in three hours."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes first we have to decide if those lost six minutes will be coming out of game time bathroom time or the pizza break."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Want some mac and cheese?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Why would you do that?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Talk to the hand."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Because I\u2019ve been busy because I haven\u2019t figured out a way to bring it up and mostly and I can\u2019t stress how key this is because I don\u2019t want to."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No. I\u2019ve reached my breaking point. I need to leave. Now."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Equally ridiculous. Let\u2019s go."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I know what he looks like."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Or I don\u2019t cut it and maybe just style it a little."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Good night Wyatt. Oh good night honey."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Howard can I ask you a question?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh. If I had one it would be Brown Dynamite."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Ugh we\u2019re the last ones here hurry up."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So how\u2019d it go?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Your words fall like acid rain on the wounded petals of my heart."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What was I supposed to do? He needed a place to sleep it off."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No Penny don\u2019t give up you can get this."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well I couldn\u2019t have done it without my two favourite girls. Martha Stewart and Rachael Ray."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay so it\u2019s a it\u2019s a David and Goliath story. It\u2019s about man against God. It\u2019s called Hammer and Whip The Untold Story of Thor versus Indiana Jones."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Like a gladiator!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey guys."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I was thinking specifically of the gentleman over there moving his lips as he enjoys the latest exploits of Betty and Veronica."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"an we change the subject? Spiders give me the jeebie-jeebies."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s because it\u2019s simple."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah sure of course I love him."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You didn\u2019t read the bio did you? He\u2019s not just a middle child he\u2019s the quintessential middle child from a broken home to boot. Psychologically speaking the attention he gets by rebelling even to the point of self-destruction is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What makes them think they\u2019re always in charge of everything?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"All right.  Who do we have here?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay I don\u2019t want this to turn into a fight."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Gentlemen is anybody interested in my old string theory books?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh. Well then I anticipate an awkward situation when you get home."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"All right this is making me crazy. Somebody\u2019s got to go over there."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Nope. Gates gave a speech at the university. Sheldon went up to him afterwards and said maybe if you weren\u2019t so distracted by sick children in Africa you could have put a little more thought into Windows Vista.\u201d"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019ll have a diet coke."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Ah then your meal choice is appropriate. Starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit available for violent expulsion."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"She was late. And she found atomic spectroscopy boring. Well I wouldn\u2019t coitus her with your genitals."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Leo you are a very sweet really funny guy. You\u2019re gonna do okay."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Don\u2019t take advice from a man who threw his shoe at a crow."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"That\u2019ll do it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":" Leonard and Penny!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Really? In front of your sister?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019ll be happy to check the math but numbers don\u2019t lie Penny. In any event now that Amy and I have spent quality time together I feel much more confident proceeding to the next stage of our relationship."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It was like a grapefruit."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"She\u2019s kind of a mean drunk but what are you gonna do?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Wait. What the hell is ding?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"No you don\u2019t get it. I want nothing to do with any woman. My heart is stone. From now on I\u2019m a monk. I renounce all worldly pleasures. Except for lobster. And garlic butter."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019m not done but thank you.  I think back to all the good times we had like uh when we went camping and spent that night telling each other all our secrets. I told him I\u2019m addicted to pedicures and he told me he lost his virginity to his cousin."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay you got me there but you\u2019re wrong about this!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I am not leaving until I\u2019m done."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh good my turn. Well this is very exciting and I wanted you to be among the first to know\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Just sit somewhere else."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh I\u2019m just doing this awful workout. I hate it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Stay calm we don\u2019t know anything about them yet. What are you doing?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Damn you you rat bastard."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okey dokey let\u2019s roll. Alright it\u2019s time to raise the roof. Oo-ooh oo-ooh."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hmm. Oh who cares?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Are you sure? That doesn\u2019t sound right."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Come on take me to work with you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Great."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yeah you\u2019ll love it. Ain\u2019t no party like a Koothra-party."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"The dragon\u2019s Christopher Walken. That\u2019s perfect."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Mmm gentlemen I put it to you the worst tapioca pudding is better than the best pudding of any other flavour."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Really? Would it be totally weird if I used it?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You\u2019ll have nerds fawning all over you. If you don\u2019t love that this marriage is in trouble."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"This chair is squeaky. Now do I fix it or get a new one?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Wait wait wait. What are these changes on page six?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That would probably save us some time."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hang on I\u2019m not saying that his feelings aren\u2019t crazy. I just don\u2019t want him to think that this isn\u2019t a safe place."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What\u2019s the matter?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You don\u2019t know his girlfriend very well."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah well I like you a lot and that\u2019s scary for me. Mostly because you\u2019re a proven flight risk."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Cool. I\u2019ll make the popcorn."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s a possibility."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh yeah think about it. We\u2019d hang out we\u2019d read comic books we\u2019d see movies. It\u2019d be like the best relationship ever."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I\u2019m sorry this is rude of me. I will go get that water. See see see see. Just now you expressed your feelings to my face. How come you could do that with me but not Raj?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I don\u2019t know maybe teach acting.  Oh sorry. Hold on. Hello?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Spoiler alert! Spoiler alert."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well I like to think I take mostly after you. Anyway speaking of Daddy I had a very strange conversation with him. He said he couldn\u2019t afford to send me money any more because of his active social life."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Better. You\u2019re the lint trap of my love."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Let\u2019s try open."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Uh-huh."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What are we drinking now?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hey Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hmm he\u2019s not crazy about needles but if you get him to go jogging it\u2019ll just pour out of his nose."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That would be great."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh come on. Not that book. It it\u2019s got like every horrible story from my childhood in it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Good. Slow."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh six."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Ooh flowers and chocolates? Somebody\u2019s trying to get me out of my panties."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You know so does Leonard. Can\u2019t I just get ready in the morning without him giving me his goofy thumbs-up? Hey-hey-hey."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You know I just read a study that suggests new mothers are better at sensing emotions for up to two years."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay look it\u2019s not my fault that she thought you were a bad boyfriend."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh my God! Is that sweater made of bees? Come on take it off. I won\u2019t tell."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"So?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You never stop talking do you?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well this calls for an expression of gratitude."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It was going well. I was showing this super hot girl how to boot up in Safe Mode. The manager got suspicious and well long story short they really do have a little jail in the mall."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019m sorry guys. Sheldon was upset Leonard and Penny were fighting I just wanted to go some place where I wasn\u2019t causing problems."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Um\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"There\u2019s no reason to worry."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"So you\u2019re attempting to pinpoint where consciousness resides in the brain."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Why are you on a diet?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"To this day I\u2019ve never touched Stuart."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Not necessarily. This is a classic example of munchausen\u2019s trilemma. Either the reason is predicated on a series of sub-reasons leading to an infinite regression or it tracks back to arbitrary axiomatic statements or it\u2019s ultimately circular i.e. I\u2019m moving out because I\u2019m moving out."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah you had a good run Fake Wolowitz. We\u2019ll remember you with nostalgic fondness the way we do the dial-up modem the VHS tape or or Leonard\u2019s gym membership."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You don\u2019t know the half of it. It was billed as a lively give-and-take on the merits of model train sizes. But it was actually a set-up to intimidate weak-minded spineless rubes into buying H-O starter sets."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You mean you want me to keep a secret."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I take issue with the word compulsive."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Right now somewhere a woman is dividing the atomic weight of the best noble gas by the number of colours in the oldest national flag still in use."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I couldn\u2019t find you guys so I bought six new friends. Three sadly are dead."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Just says anyone in the world.

I\u2019m always attracted to women I can\u2019t have. I do it all the time. I did the same thing with the two of you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"To get sex."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey show her the trunk. Show her the trunk."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay well this time it\u2019s going to be different. Because I am like a romance ninja.

It\u2019s mine. Let go."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right. Come in. You look positively orange with loneliness. No I don\u2019t see that catching on at all."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah and they can all move in with you and your mother the current Mrs. Wolowitz."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I think you\u2019d be pleased to hear that this morning in the parking garage I saw this oil stain on the ground that was shaped just like my ex-girlfriend Lucy and I didn\u2019t get upset at all."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Ugh. Leonard?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"This isn\u2019t so bad."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh. How much does it cost to get them off my lap?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Almost."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You don\u2019t think it\u2019s worthwhile to try to get more women working in science."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You know to be fair we did get married in Vegas and didn\u2019t invite her."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well our friend Raj moved into my old room and it\u2019s brought up a lot of negative feelings for me."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hang on."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh great."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey since when do you do laundry on a Thursday?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"And if you\u2019re not in the mood for coffee I can always make you a Chai Tea-3PO."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What are you talking about?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Philadelphia. Okay now I get it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"This is bad."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hang on. Building on what Leonard said no one built on what I said."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I know right? Maybe I should just move back to Nebraska."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I don\u2019t understand."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Howard\u2019s capsule should be re-entering the atmosphere any minute."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Wait wait. Sheldon stop being crazy for a second. How much is something like this worth?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m over it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And thanks to you I know better than to ask if you\u2019re menstruating. And based on your behaviour I don\u2019t have to."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay. So in the last 20 minutes we\u2019ve seen a crazy woman kissing a fetus in a jar. We\u2019ve seen a guy cut in half and sewn to a fish."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"That\u2019s the only logical inference."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well of course they\u2019re movies. Were you expecting me to come up with an example involving a real life time machine? That\u2019s absurd."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What twelve year old boy wants a motorised dirt bike?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I never kid about safety."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No. We are committing genetic fraud. There\u2019s no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high IQ offspring think about that.

You can see it another day."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh my God you\u2019re about to jibber-jabber about jibber-jabber."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Excuse me. Starting to watch a television show that might run for years isn\u2019t a decision to take lightly. I\u2019m wrestling with a big commitment issue here."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What the hell? How long has she been here?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"But a cannon? Am I really out of the game?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I thought it was funny."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Peppermint schnapps."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"All the more shame that will fall upon the house of Hofstadter."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Penny I have an eidetic memory.

Oh in that case it was pretty good."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thirty feet."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s not a present it\u2019s the present. Look. There\u2019s you and me. There\u2019s Penny and Amy. We\u2019re playing Pictionary.

What\u2019s up?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Sheldon you have two choices. Either you let him put a bigger hard drive in the TiVo or you delete stuff before we go out of town."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Sure of course.

When Amy was in my life I was hyper-focused on my work and ignored her."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Zazzles?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Wait doesn\u2019t anyone have a rod of resurrection? Because if you\u2019ve got one I need it bad.

I have a big decision to make and I\u2019m scared."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well there was a misbegotten adventure with a waitress who lives across the hall. It ended as inexplicably as it began. They had very little in common except for carnal activity. That\u2019s why I acquired these noise-cancelling headphones. If you decide to use them please clean the ear pieces afterwards with the Wet Wipes you\u2019ll find in the bathroom. They\u2019re in the drawer labelled Wet Wipes."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh Leonard honey if we started living together I wouldn\u2019t be able to keep my hands off you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Perhaps I\u2019ll spend some time developing a unified theory of comedy which will allow me to elicit laughter from anyone at any time. Unless they\u2019re German \u2019cause that\u2019s a tough crowd."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"She meant Emily."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hey guys. Mind if Emily joins us for lunch?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Sheldon Cooper does not do cozy."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Red Leader I\u2019m really sorry."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh that\u2019s just the tip of the sadness iceberg."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hang on. You know what? You have been a jerk about this all day. You always do this whenever I mess up you\u2019re right there to make me feel even worse about it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So if you don\u2019t like this Christie why are you letting her stay?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well uh as your friend you might like to know that um we didn\u2019t have sex in the conventional sense."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well I\u2019m open to that."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Are you pointing out that California is a community property state and since Howard and Bernadette are married the intellectual property contained in that letter is jointly owned by the two spouses?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Thanks for coming with me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019d be happy to create a chart and participate in a differential diagnosis."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thank you Amy. Very touching. Howard and Bernadette you are lucky enough to be best friends who love each other. And that\u2019s the strongest kind of love because at its core it has kindness patience and respect.

I hope that you can accept my apology."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well I care. I mean look if we\u2019re gonna do this why not try and make it something we\u2019re actually proud of?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well you\u2019re kidding right?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Arthur Jeffries was a scientist. I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t care about silly superstitions like funerals. You know if he were here I think he\u2019d say enjoy Star Wars Day."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Ah hey Leslie."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"is he deliberately blowing smoke at me?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Honey?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I just love decorating the Christmas tree. It makes me feel like a little girl again."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey Stuart have you seen Sheldon?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay this is definitely the most fun thing we can do with the money."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I know that.

Spock came from a planet governed only by logic. You know on Vulcan when your brother asks why are you hitting yourself? the answer is I\u2019m not. You\u2019re moving my arm.

No wonder gentleman callers are pounding down your door. Do you have any questions for me?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Who?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wait. You were really gonna stand by me against the dining room table?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay. I can do this. Just give me a moment\u2026 Oh! Mimosas coming up."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Wait I don\u2019t which part?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"He got us again."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well we got to make a run to the hardware store."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re engaged to my friend. Oh here she comes."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"On Caprica night?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And if anyone were to actually call that number they will hear this."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh what a jerk."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Fine. In the parlance of the urban music scene what\u2019s the 4-1-1?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Why is there a hole in my new office? I\u2019ve narrowed it down to two possibilities There was something in the wall that someone outside the wall wanted or the more disturbing there was something in the wall that wanted out."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"That\u2019s funny because those aren\u2019t the kind of kisses you want on your nipples."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Fine. I\u2019m calling home but when I\u2019m done you\u2019re calling your mother."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh my I would love that."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"And it looks like she lost a lot of weight damn it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh yes. The losers will be publicly humiliated in a fashion to be chosen by the victor. FYI I plan on having you publish a scientific paper expounding the discredited Velikovsky hypothesis."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey Penny."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh now I need your permission for that too?!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"We\u2019re just bending the rules a little. We have grant money to do the experiment so we\u2019re going to spend it on the helium we need. It\u2019s not like when Dr. Goldfarb claimed he bought an electron microscope and he was really just keeping a Russian girl in an apartment in Van Nuys."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"And what\u2019s that?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well that\u2019s just Batman."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You\u2019d have no girlfriend to see you naked you\u2019d try to fill the void with food and I\u2019m an enabler who once deep-fried a pancake."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It\u2019s gross but I have to eat it because I met somebody."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"No no Penny don\u2019t dismiss his feelings."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Can we please talk about something other than my depressing love life?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Of course."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hi-lo. Oops. I started to say hi and then I switched to hello in the middle. It came out hi-lo. Duh. Uh it\u2019s nice to meet you. I\u2019ve read both your books and most of your papers. I\u2019m Leonard I live"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Uh okay that\u2019s a separate issue. Let\u2019s put a pin in that and just focus on the passive thing."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh Lord you just rang Stan Lee\u2019s doorbell. At Stan Lee\u2019s house. We\u2019re about to go in and have milk and cookies with Stan Lee."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You know why. The Nintendo DS. And the PSP. Now the Gameboy."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Psh what a bunch of crybabies. No guts no glory man."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"All right maybe I overreacted. So we\u2019re in two different places emotionally. So what? And maybe I\u2019m a little ahead of you. That\u2019s fine. You know. In fact it makes sense \u2019cause let\u2019s face it I\u2019ve been in this relationship two years longer than you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh sure. Let me see it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I can\u2019t believe they did that."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Please don\u2019t be upset. I just I didn\u2019t want you ending up with a bad grade and get discouraged and give up on the idea of going back to school."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah. You too. Uh Jimmy this is Sheldon and Raj and Howard."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Coming. "},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Will Amy be joining us for dinner?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You\u2019re being ridiculous."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh! No I beg to differ. Of the three of us I was by far the most supportive."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yeah but since you and Penny finally hooked up we thought you two would be having bouncy naked yum-yum night."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay look if Leonard finds out that I lied I will absolutely die of embarrassment."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay. Then what happened?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh my God. What a day."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You okay? You kind of look like Zack trying to figure out that tip."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Though we did ding up the back pretty good with the crib so you might have bought a minivan."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And you understand that will involve me telling you what to do?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Mm. I want to build a road but I need wood. Do either of you fellows have wood?  I don\u2019t understand the laughter. The object of Settlers of Catan is to build roads and settlements. To do so requires wood. Now I have sheep; I need wood. Who has wood for my sheep?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Irrelevant. Rajesh and I have a good thing going and you\u2019re not going to ruin it.  What are you doing here?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon that\u2019s incredible."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay what exactly are we looking for?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh-huh?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon are you gonna join us?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I had not considered that."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Really ten miles? You\u2019re orbiting inside the atmosphere? Moron."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Why would you do that?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"They have beach right in the name. What do you think?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"There\u2019s a motion on the floor I\u2019m ridiculous. Do we have a second? Hmm? Hmm? There is no second. The motion is denied. Next time make sure you have the votes first. That was embarrassing."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I think I know the answer to this but just to be clear it\u2019s not me right?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well we will. We\u2019re just not in a rush."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You\u2019ll wish it would kill you."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Wait my laptop. "},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"There are a number of options and I\u2019m really not familiar enough with the cushion densities air flow patterns and dispersion of sunlight to make an informed choice."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Next we need a teaspoon of pepper which I believe was also the name of your childhood dog."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Aw sweetie I\u2019m comfortable around you too."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh hey."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"If any of you are looking for something to do on Valentine\u2019s Day Amy and I\u2019ll be streaming our first-ever live episode of Fun With Flags. You\u2019re welcome to join us as we celebrate the timeless love affair between wind and flapping fabric."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Never mind."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh wow. I love Taming of the Shrew. I did a paper on it in high school. Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting? In his tail."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"They don\u2019t? Well apparently these people and I differ greatly on the definition of party."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Amy you look great."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh a gift certificate for motorcycle lessons. Very thoughtful."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Snort it down and keep eating!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well perhaps I can help. Sherlock Holmes always says when you eliminate the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth. Now have have you tried doing that?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Mm."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"English is your native language."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay uh you check for squeaks and I will mark them down."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You know I I\u2019ve been thinking that maybe meeting somebody one-on-one is too intense so Friday night my friends are having a party."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well I\u2019m not trying to have sex with her."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Look I know you guys are upset but we\u2019ve talked about it and we think it\u2019d be beneficial for you to be part of the project."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"And that bright little star peeking her head out early today that\u2019s Venus."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Just a warning Sheldon the freezer locks from the outside."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Can I tell her I miss her?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh dude. The minute you opened that e-mail they knew you got it. I mean they\u2019re probably looking at you through the camera right now. I love America."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I think I understand. You\u2019re the one person who can say Sheldon Cooper is your boyfriend but that rings hollow if you can\u2019t lord him over others in the flesh. I forget what I bring to the party and what I take away when I leave. Please accept these valuable Cooper Coupons as restitution."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Leonard is wrong."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No. That wouldn\u2019t be funny at all."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Look on the bright side."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Guys before this gets ugly remember the winner gets Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well apparently the news didn\u2019t reach my digestive system which when startled has its own version of Anything Can Happen Thursday."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No I want you to go."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Maybe we should start small."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t think so. Leonard can\u2019t stand yoga the beach massages or dancing."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Of course."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh come on man. Bros before\u2026 my sister."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You work with Sheldon you tell me."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"So you never played baseball as a kid not even Little League?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Maybe he didn\u2019t notice."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I thought Stuart was looking after her."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Neck massage then you get me that beverage."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s all gone. All gone."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thanks."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"And you think my presence will help with that?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Excuse me. No one does a better job pretending to be a person than I do. Siri comes close but I know more jokes."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah it seems only right that she have it back."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Invite them to live with us."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon you are not in charge."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hey Stuart."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Can you focus on what we\u2019re talking about?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"R2-D2 and C-3PO. Dibs on Threepio."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Putting them on."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Let\u2019s set up the equipment. It\u2019ll help take your mind off of it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No you were right the first time this is a man who loves me but in his own stupid way he was just trying to show people how he feels."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah. It comes from the swear jar we put money in when you curse."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"More potion please."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Thank you Sheldon. It\u2019s a blank notebook."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh but there\u2019s money for a drawer full of Red Vines a marshmallow shooting rifle and a super executive ant farm with glow-in-the-dark sand?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Just to be clear sex is off the table right?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well that sucks."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay well tell him I loved him on Star Trek."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":" Leonard\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"No he\u2019s doesn\u2019t! He\u2019s lying to you!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I do your life is fine you big baby."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Really?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Regarding what?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Um\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey. How about we bring back Anything Can Happen Thursdays?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Gee Sheldon you\u2019re asking the wrong girl. I\u2019m usually on the other side of the tie."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t see how a tax lawyer from Fort Lauderdale could be helpful regarding intellectual property."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Where didn\u2019t I go? I went to New York Chicago Atlanta Denver Seattle."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Where are you going?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"See? Now that\u2019s the great thing. We\u2019re out as friends. This is not a date. Sex is off the table. So let\u2019s go learn why hydroelectric power might not be the environmental bargain you think it is. Sorry. Spoiler alert."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t want to hear this."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh please I was just pointing it out. I have no desire to engage in the activity."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"How about Penny\u2019s depressing acting career?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I remember him."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"That\u2019s so much better than the old ugly ones."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to choose between Emily and Lucy?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"So does that mean we can go with the girls again?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So Amy what\u2019s going on with your addiction study?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Goody. What\u2019s it say?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No. You know what? Don\u2019t. Don\u2019t. Let\u2019s let them think they\u2019re getting away with it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"How do I know you\u2019re not going to take my ideas and publish them as your own?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Come on you got to work with me. We need to get connected with our bodies."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"We can\u2019t sell it. We have to keep it and love it and polish it and only take it out occasionally when we go to the park and re-enact our favourite scenes from the movies."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What\u2019s sheetrock?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Look I\u2019m still happy to drive you to work. Nothing\u2019s changed in that regard. We\u2019re still roommates we\u2019re still friends."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"So what other celebrity genitalia have you handled?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Good because I would hate that."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Ah much better."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Sheldon when I said I was fine I meant I didn\u2019t want to talk about it any more."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well at least you finally got a window that opens. That\u2019s nice."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hmm? Yeah? What? Huh?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Pass."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh well you can\u2019t blame me for not jumping to that conclusion."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s too late. Get ready to like me."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh I have to go to the bathroom so bad."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Not at all. He\u2019s forgotten how miserable he was the entire time he was up there. It\u2019s like me in those moments when I miss India."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Who just had sex with me at work."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"See ya."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Did it ever occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort organise and label the entire world around them?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Tell me why you woke me up or I swear to God I will kill you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Would it help if I gave him some pointers? I\u2019m just funnin\u2019 ya."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You did?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No one told you to taste them. Come on is is this good or not?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay okay you know I get it Leonard has no business being involved with a waitress slash actress who felt so insecure that she lied to him about finishing community college."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh I heard about that. Why didn\u2019t you discover it?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Darts is a bar game. You\u2019ve been frequenting drinking establishments since you were of legal age."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You know thanks for closed-captioning my pain Raj."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Uh it\u2019s in the corner."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Not that secret the other secret."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I have no difficulty believing you\u2019re not butter."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Abundantly."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Superheroes take performance-enhancing chemicals?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah yeah that too."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I can vouch for that."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"It means nothing to anybody. Come here let me show you what I\u2019m doing."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Sorry papa."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"This is the swampland of Dagobah. It\u2019s where Luke was trained in the ways of the Jedi."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What? I didn\u2019t sign it yet."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"My Physics Bowl Trophy!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay look they sent me the ticket. I told them I wasn\u2019t driving and they were all if it wasn\u2019t you who was it?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Amy I could use some help."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hmm well it\u2019s a little Hollywood. But I think I can pull it off. Well done Penny."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Maybe that\u2019s because your hole is still open."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t know now they\u2019re just yelling about Popsicles. Sounds like Penny really got to him."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Irrelevant. See I was studying recombinant DNA technology and I was confident I could create one but my parents were unwilling to secure the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen. Course my sister got swimming lessons when she wanted them."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Have you heard from Howard?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You stayed in Michigan all week to avoid being around me?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"So you admit that you\u2019re an egotist?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Potl."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I was just thinking we should probably turn in too."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"He does sound effects too!"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well good for him."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Look most importantly this will let you move on and study dark matter."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What\u2019s Plan B?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Are you sure? I\u2019d really like to."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It is not my fault that your mother likes me better than she likes you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes but it\u2019s like you\u2019re right here in the room."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh even better than money. You gained experience points."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yes absolutely. Now they\u2019re doing that phony link-arm-drink thingy. I totally taught him that."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay you can\u2019t just go chasing after every girl who\u2019s nice to you."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What do we do now?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Good night."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Dammit dammit dammit dammit dammit dammit."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh we can get this. Is there any chance it\u2019s upside-down?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well I have broken up with my fair share of guys. I mean how many times did I break up with Leonard?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hey how come I wasn\u2019t part of this deal?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You have two strikes. Three strikes and you\u2019re out. It\u2019s a sports metaphor."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well that\u2019s not much of an apology but I\u2019ll take it."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It\u2019s also a live mine so there\u2019ll be dynamite explosions going off in the distance."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"That is so cool. Old broken things are so much better than new things that work."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019ll leave it up to the dungeon master."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well her actions could be out of concern for your feelings. Perhaps she\u2019s excluded you from these gatherings because she\u2019s scouting for a new mate and doesn\u2019t want to do it in front of you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well not necessarily. You know Dad\u2019s not getting any younger so if I wait long enough I\u2019ll just tell him he walked me down the aisle and it was magical."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"If you\u2019ll recall the Vogon fleet blew up the Earth anyway."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Calm down. Howard has something he wants to say to you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"She broke up with me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Because I have no interest in standing in the Rose Room of the Pasadena Marriott in front of a group of judgemental strangers who wouldn\u2019t recognise true genius if it were standing in front of them giving a speech. Which if I were there it would be."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes please. Your girlfriend\u2019s a little short-tempered."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yeah I read your paper online. That technique for creating a new heavy element is inspired."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"That\u2019s why I already cleaned up in here and all the other rooms in the hall."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"This is fun. I have never cleaned a toilet before."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Everything is quantifiable. That French fry? A seven. Spider-Man? A nine. The number nine? Oddly only a four."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"But I\u2019m a professional scientist."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"There is no season three. They cancelled that show."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Now you listen to me I am no longer a child and I will not be spoken to like one. Now if you\u2019d excuse me I have to go throw up."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Ooh!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Where did you move it?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Really? That\u2019s amazing. And you gave me the robes to give it in. Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I won\u2019t be able to make our date night this Thursday so bad news for you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You can\u2019t be serious. \u2018Cause I messed up and made out with a girl you\u2019re gonna do the same with a random guy?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"If you\u2019ll excuse me I\u2019m going to pack."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah I know the feeling."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah. And forgive my crude penmanship. I didn\u2019t start typing until I was six."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Not Sunday I love Sunday."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No that\u2019s not it."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah okay just do me a favour and stop talking about how great Claire is."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yep I don\u2019t see any way around it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Stop! I\u2019m going to wet myself!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh yeah no this thing\u2019s majorly out of order.  See? Sorry."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s one of a kind."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Please. You\u2019re looking at Facebook to find out how their date went."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Then she\u2019s going to have to convince your mother to let you go into space."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You guys have any idea how much it costs to see a marriage counsellor?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Dude come on."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"My Mee-Maw must never know of this. Now will you give Professor Hawking my paper?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah you got it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh yeah me too."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You know a man can care deeply about a woman and a pet. It\u2019s not strange."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh just give us a few minutes."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I\u2019m fine."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Still I think it\u2019s time for me to get rid of this stuff and\u2026 you know\u2026 move on with my life."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well if you are so protective of the scientific method perhaps we should use the next five weeks to finish what we started."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay fine. Well what if we just flip it over? There. Looks fine right?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I have a functioning and satisfying relationship with a female. You have none."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Three times. He begged the Fox network not to cancel Firefly. He begged the TNT network to cancel Babylon 5. And when he got food poisoning at the Rose Bowl Parade he begged a deity he doesn\u2019t believe in to end his life quickly."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Wait I got it. I got it\/"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Because if it did have to do with trains and you were gonna give\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s right off the dust jacket of my mom\u2019s last book."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Congratulations Dr. Fowler. You just made the fort."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"They\u2019re not even trying. Remember the Satanimals pack with the Hellephant? Why absurd. What was he a bad elephant who died and went to hell? What could an elephant possibly do that would cause him eternal damnation?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey look who\u2019s out after dark like a big boy."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t care about that."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Nice hat Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Thank you. Good luck with your future endeavours."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah. Hey you know if this was in Sheldon and Leonard\u2019s apartment I wouldn\u2019t wind up sitting on the floor all the time."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sure."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah I\u2019m so glad you guys could watch."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Do that. See?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Another happy accident."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Alright but if we\u2019re going to use flight metaphors I\u2019m much more suited to being the guy from the FAA analysing wreckage."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Something you\u2019d like to share? A tale of woe perhaps."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Ooh uh Emily gets off work soon. Why don\u2019t the four of us go out?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No no it\u2019s okay. I mean let\u2019s face it you guys would get creamed without me."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"All right."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Of course it will require a vote. Unfortunately my official gavel is in my bedroom but luckily I have my travel gavel."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No that was a different different guy."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t know. Should we call Sheldon and Howard?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sheldon we know this is a sensitive subject and Leonard\u2019s not gonna move out until you\u2019re ready."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"A far less impressive feat."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Look I\u2019m sorry you violated the terms of your metaphor by acknowledging her existence. I\u2019m out."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hi! Stephanie right?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That was fun. Maybe tomorrow we can go to one of those big warehouse stores."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I know how to get the bucket! I can turn the axe around and use the handle to reach it. Let\u2019s see. Go north. You are in a forest. Go north. You are in a forest. Go north. You are in a forest. Oh dear I believe I\u2019m lost. Well I\u2019ll just have to get a fresh start tomorrow."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well not with that attitude."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Come in."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh that sounds lovely."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So you said you had something to tell me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Howard listen to me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Good what?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay. We\u2019ll be back as soon as we can."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well excuse me Amy was testing you. I was rooting for you. Good job on that banana box by the way."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh hey."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well he asked me out again and I said yes and then I started thinking maybe I should talk to you first."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What? no. no that\u2019s not right."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019ll be there as soon as I can."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh I don\u2019t want credit for that."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"One."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay. I know. It was me. I I pushed too hard. I\u2019m sorry."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Wow. What did you tell them?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"There\u2019s some in the fridge."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Why would we want that?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"One two three four five. No way."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh yes. Canine football fans are a common sight in Texas. Cats however refuse to wear sporting apparel. My sister found that out the hard way."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Any particular reason why?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh sounds great."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Sheldon is a very smart man and he obviously wants to keep this a secret."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"How about a hearty handshake?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t think it matters if this is a stalemate or an impasse or a Mexican standoff. What are we gonna do here?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"My turn."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah hang on. Let me just finish this chapter."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s me. Bye Stuart."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Like to music?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Ooh my friend Stephen just played the word act for 18 points. That\u2019s right I call him Stephen now because I checked and he was not okay with Wheels."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"So as they say all good things must come to an end."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"This is Penny. She is your friend. If she offers you food it\u2019s safe to take it. You probably paid for it anyway."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll appreciate carrying his samples in a briefcase instead of his colon. How long do you think he\u2019ll stay?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh great now you\u2019re gonna get emotional. I always looked up to you and Pop-Pop. I I know what a challenging man he could be but I saw you stand by him and-and make him into a better person."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"How hard did she stomp?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Fine. Um on the count of three. One two\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sheldon what did you do?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Actually all I did was invite you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What the hell?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Ooh a pocket watch."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"A menial job. Like yours."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh God!"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay I think we should do it right now."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m sorry what were the choices again?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh you know he\u2019s good."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh what what what?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"No I got it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Which book are we looking for?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well it makes perfect sense. Because you\u2019re an expectant mother you can\u2019t drink alcohol. I don\u2019t like to. You can\u2019t have sushi. I don\u2019t like to. You can\u2019t go in hot tubs. I consider them vats of sweaty people soup."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hello."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I\u2019m sorry. What was I thinking?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Now. "},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Actually we got in a pretty nasty fight."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay now you\u2019re going to insert the flash drive into the USB port. She calls me Moon Pie because I\u2019m nummy-nummy and she could just eat me up now please put the flash drive in the USB port. The one that looks like a little duck\u2019s mouth."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Sheldon doesn\u2019t get along with Sheldon. It\u2019s still no reason for me to have to listen to you arm your photon torpedoes every night."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No I don\u2019t think you are."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I know and there\u2019s no excuse for that."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hmm I\u2019m a professor at Stanford."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Here let me try. Call McFlono McFloonyloo. Heh-heh."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What is the best number? By the way there\u2019s only one correct answer."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh yes. You must be Lakshmi. Uh nice to meet you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What\u2019s going on?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No. No woman would."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Because you do this kind of thing all the time and then you try to cover it up."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What? That is not true. Bernadette wants a pre-nup."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You are unbelievable. I don\u2019t know why I put up with you. You\u2019re controlling you\u2019re irritating."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Thanks. He seems like a nice guy."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Alright alright. Boy we are learning a lot here huh? Thank you astronaut Howard. Um I am what\u2019s called an experimental physicist which is super-fun because I get to test theories and work with lasers. Yes?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"And mythological."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh there you are. Leonard I know you\u2019re upset about recent events and I have someone here to help. "},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Actually I\u2019m busy."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That\u2019s not what I meant."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Look at us. We\u2019re like the Rockettes."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes half eagle half lion."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay well thanks for sharing with us. Good night."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And now you\u2019re out of life. Why did you hit pause?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Why would I want to do that?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well there\u2019s a reception for my magazine article on Saturday."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Wow."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s eleven fifteen. I\u2019m requesting your quarter-hourly location update."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What Sheldon? What Sheldon? What Sheldon?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m Dr. Cooper from the Physics Department."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I\u2019ll do it."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh okay great. Now I can look like Val Kilmer as Batman instead of Val Kilmer as he looks today."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Really when was the last time you left the house."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey you can make jokes but if this keeps up he\u2019s gonna move back in here."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No no of course you have to publish. That\u2019s your responsibility as a scientist. Doing otherwise would be unethical. You have no choice."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Ah good Penny you\u2019re here to exchange gifts. You\u2019ll be pleased to know I\u2019m prepared for whatever you have to offer."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m sorry. I was trying to think of what rhymes with nose of the aardvark."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Am I? Here. Eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hmm Priya\u2019s not back yet? Well I guess that\u2019s not unusual women men the whole sitting standing deal so what are we talking about?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What the hell are bus pants?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Who\u2019s Paul?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"How can I meet someone new when everywhere I look I see Lucy\u2019s face? Tell me you don\u2019t see her smile in the crust of this chicken pot pie."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Great. Tropicana no pulp."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Are you really gonna sit here all day?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No sorry. Wait! Please come back!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hang on hang on. We\u2019re smart we can figure this out. Okay so Mary and Beverley can\u2019t be together. Uh Alfred and Beverley can\u2019t be together. Leonard and I can\u2019t be together. Now I could be with Alfred but I don\u2019t like his face. Oh here. I\u2019ve got it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah maybe."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey Barry we\u2019re in trouble. We need liquid helium does the department have any we can use?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s amusing that he doesn\u2019t hear it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"A Christmas gift? You know I don\u2019t enjoy Christmas."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You know India?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I mean you could say thank you. I did just buy you a car."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"We\u2019re not."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What are you talking about?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well no sir and do you know why? In a word tradition. Every Thursday night for the last eight years you and I and our friends have gathered here in this very spot to break bread covered with cheese and sauce discuss the issues of the day and yes share a laugh or two. But I guess our rich heritage means nothing to you."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Booya."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s late. We\u2019ve wasted hours. Can we please find it in ourselves to do any amount of work tonight?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So Sheldon says you have a new girlfriend."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"So as Hannah Montana Miley was a world-famous pop star. But then she would take off her wig and go to school like a normal girl. Which I don\u2019t have to tell you at that age is its own headache."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You know it\u2019s not exactly glamorous up there. The water that the astronauts drink is made from each other\u2019s recycled urine."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And I have the soulful eyes of a cow."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well I hope you\u2019re wrong. I really want to go to the train store."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019ve seen that. Yeah. Serial Apeist. Howard found it online the day we met you."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You\u2019re kidding."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I give you one simple thing to do contact a complete stranger and make her fall in love with me and you blow it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Why would you do such a thing?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What\u2019s he doing in your apartment?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I miss Stuart\u2019s place. All this loud music and exposed brick. What is this a comic book store or a rave at the third little pig\u2019s house?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh it\u2019s complicated. He finds pushing that little door and reaching up into the machine"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You know what you could make us do? Ice-skating. The cold air will trigger Leonard\u2019s asthma and it plays right into my well-known fear of getting flattened by a Zamboni."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay listen I don\u2019t mean to diminish what you\u2019re going through but I\u2019m a little distracted right now."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I thought that was gonna break the other way."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"She\u2019s right. That\u2019s reasonable."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So wait what have you been doing for the past six months?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It\u2019s different. You\u2019re people don\u2019t worship lox."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You\u2019re not helping."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"And then after coffee we went for a walk and she told me she always thought people from India were exotic and mysterious. So with my mouth I said we\u2019re just like anybody else but with my eyes I said straight up Red hop on my flying carpet."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You\u2019re so butch."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Good morning. If I could have everyone\u2019s attention please? I know we\u2019re all eager to get on the road to Big Sur so if we focus I\u2019m sure we can get through this orientation in under a half an hour. Then it\u2019s just Q&A quiz safety drills pose for commemorative group photo and we\u2019re off."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t think your heart\u2019s in it but since you asked. Apparently because Leonard is dating Raj\u2019s sister we\u2019re all forced to hang out at his apartment."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"It\u2019s open."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"My cousin does work in a call centre."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hi Howard."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah well I\u2019m supposed to be in Vegas throwing up on a shrimp buffet. Now give it. All right what do I need?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You slipped and fell into a robot hand?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That nagging tone is helping my anxiety yeah. But if you could maybe just go ten percent less shrill that\u2019d really put the zip-a-dee in my doo-dah."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You want to talk about it?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Now can we have cookies and Hawaiian Punch?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Ugh. Hey Sheldon? Hi. This came for you today. It\u2019s from your mom."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah I was. I was 200 pounds by the time I was in middle school. Kids were mean. Cows may be sacred there but it doesn\u2019t help if you look like one. Anyway I was pretty lonely so I had to make up my own stories and games and I promised myself if I ever made any friends that that I would play those games with them."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Good. "},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"So let\u2019s roll up our sleevis and get to know Nevis.  Well I I like that but next time check with me."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sheldon\u2019s spot. The coin is in your spot."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Her behaviour. No I have the feeling that she\u2019s hiding something."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"So did I."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh good. Then you won\u2019t be disappointed."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No we don\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"All right then break it off with the new girl."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh me too. You\u2019re so caring. I\u2019ve often pictured you guiding a young boy into manhood."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"All? In particle physics twenty five is Woodstock."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Careful if you don\u2019t get it all it\u2019ll only come back worse."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"True but thanks to meditation I am able to stay in the same room with them without urinating. Now close your eyes."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Plus I get to hang out with him again at the hearing. This is going to look great hanging next to my restraining order from Leonard Nimoy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Studies have shown that performing tasks such as eating talking on a cell phone or drinking coffee while driving reduces one\u2019s reaction time by the same factor as an ounce of alcohol."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh thank you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Studying abroad?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You guys made a person."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"He won\u2019t leave he says he\u2019s afraid he\u2019ll pass out on the bus and someone will harvest his organs."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Actually that helps thank you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Amy I can\u2019t just ask Wil Wheaton to leave. He\u2019s a minor celebrity. Once you explain who he is many people recognize him."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I\u2019m starting to see why you and your mom aren\u2019t very close."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Don\u2019t even! I don\u2019t want to hear another word out of you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"We didn\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"But Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What difference does it make? Fat is fat."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Very nice. You lie to my sister."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah right. You can just shut your feelings off. There goes television lying to us again. We let you raise our children and this is the thanks we get. Leonard how could I have been so foolish to try and follow in the footsteps of a made-up alien race with no emotions?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well since he won\u2019t take the bus and he\u2019s too evolved to drive he decided it would be easier to just sleep in his office and shower in the radiation lab until I\u2019m finished with my experiment."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard I platonically love you man but face it you\u2019re a mess."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Is that you Raj? I don\u2019t recognize your edge."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m her friend I\u2019m not going to take advantage of her vulnerability."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I said I don\u2019t want you to. I\u2019m getting another drink."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah but not your books. Something they might enjoy. I kid of course. Big fan."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Friends! It\u2019s Words with Friends! Which Stephen Hawking and I officially are. Now all I need is a bunk bed with a slide I\u2019ll have everything I\u2019ve ever wanted since I was six years old."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey Sheldon you\u2019re always full of fun little facts. Where did the expression got your ass handed to you come from?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Did he respond yet?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Be there in a minute. I just have to pre-soak these."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s sweet that he thinks there\u2019s a story."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I can\u2019t find that quote on the Internet. Did you make that up?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Right.  Penny. Are you going to answer the door or should I open it and say aha again?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh teacher! Me! Me!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You know when my honour is insulted and I need to challenge someone to a duel by slapping them across the face with my glove."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Just sit down and eat."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I wouldn\u2019t expect you to. I\u2019ll see you later."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh Shelly? A man\u2019s here to take you away to the future. Be sure to pack clean underwear."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Bye-bye"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Bug report When a guy asks me to spend time with him maybe he plans something a little more interesting than hanging out at home watching TV."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I scraped gum off the bottom of that table. Only \u2019cause my manager saw me put it there."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Although copyright law would allow me to quote snippets in the context of a review."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Why do you have to make everything so filthy? Why couldn\u2019t you just say the blog is like her giving me the key to her heart?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh. You know what? I\u2019m gonna let them know that I\u2019m here with you and that they\u2019re busted."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I uh huh."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"That\u2019s incredible. Oh here break out the math."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Really?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I remember it distinctly because I had just composed my annual poem commemorating the anniversary of Dr. Seuss\u2019s death."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Guys before this gets ugly remember the winner gets Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I think she knows what I meant."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Ooh big talk from a man who was once treed by a chicken."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Fair enough. What stake do you propose?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Are you up-to-date on Game of Thrones?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Do you mind? I\u2019m questioning a lot of things in my life right now."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah you know what she is my mother-in-law and I\u2019d like for us to have a good relationship."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Why not?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You\u2019re kidding."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What about a game of tag on a French schoolyard?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh are you still going to spend the night?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No everything\u2019s fine."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay. Were you talking before she got upset?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No go ahead say it. I know what it is. I\u2019ve heard it my whole life. The word\u2019s annoying. Go ahead say it. Say it. Say I\u2019m annoying."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Wait your your mother is sleeping with your dentist?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay I see where this is going. Fine I\u2019ll have sex with him."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I get that okay? It\u2019s just Leonard and I have been married for two years and we\u2019re no further along than when we were dating."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It\u2019s not superstition. It\u2019s practically Newtonian. For every action there\u2019s an equal and opposite reaction. Leonard pretends to be a friend and acts like a two-faced bitch therefore he is reborn as a banana slug. It\u2019s actually a very elegant system you know what goes around comes around."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I I don\u2019t know if you remember me."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh come on we could share a pretzel and get sideways glances from racist old ladies."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well Stephanie since Leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball I guess I\u2019ll just have to pick it up. Have you ever witnessed a violent crime?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right. Let\u2019s play Physics Fiesta."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What you writing there?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Five more minutes."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Excuse me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah well I knocked on the front door but you didn\u2019t hear it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"My bad. I did send a gift from both of us."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Calm down okay? Try not to think about it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I doubt it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I\u2019m gonna go."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Nothing it\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with him."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Holy crap."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"That\u2019s very mature of you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t think you can do both."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You want to make plans for New Years."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah but now you make me wonder what\u2019s wrong with you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Only nine more months to comic-con."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Since I rarely hug I\u2019m relying on your expertise regarding duration."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m the child she was worried about? I have a brother and sister whose combined intellectual wattage couldn\u2019t power a potato clock if I spotted them the potato."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh my God. She\u2019s not gonna bathe me is she?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"If I don\u2019t call her I won\u2019t hear the end of it from my parents."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"That\u2019s wonderful. A lawyer my sister\u2019s a lawyer. Look at that we have something in common."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay how do I look?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"But e-excuse me I have something to say. None of you may realize it but I was very much looking forward to this weekend. It was gonna be like the old days the four of us hanging out playing video games before you guys all got girlfriends. Do you have any idea what it\u2019s like to be the only one without a girlfriend? Even if I get one someday I\u2019ll still be the guy who got a girl after Sheldon Cooper!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"We\u2019ve had this planned for a week."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I tried making it better he wouldn\u2019t go for it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s in a FedEx box on its way back to where it came from."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Thanks for skipping the movie. I couldn\u2019t sit in that theatre for two hours wondering about Emily and that guy."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m still tweaking things a little bit but this will give you the general idea of the Web site. So what do you guys think?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard wait. Take me with you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"But once you open the box you\u2019ve voided the warranty. The warranty is a sacred covenant we\u2019ve entered into with the manufacturer. He offers to stand by his equipment and we in return agree not to violate the integrity of the internal hardware. This little orange sticker is all that stands between us and anarchy."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You want a real challenge try keeping me from eating more of these."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I can see that. I was providing you with an alternative. A courtesy I was never offered in similar circumstances."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Maybe that\u2019s because I\u2019m not being challenged. It\u2019s the same reason Einstein failed math."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh really? Since meeting her what have been your greatest accomplishments?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh. Okay. Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well what if we go around the university and just get the patent ourselves?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Apparently perfect attendance isn\u2019t cool any more."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well I know he didn\u2019t cheat on you so what happened?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay. "},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Do you think he\u2019s building a bomb?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay well if you find him use the kitchen island that coffee table will not support both of you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well hey I\u2019m just as much fun as you are."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay the X10s are online."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No it is not yours. We all went in on the box together."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Trying to use a Jedi mind trick to control Stephen Hawking. Play. Play. Ugh! He must be wearing a tinfoil hat or something."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I don\u2019t see why not."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Exactly."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Ready for lunch?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"We haven\u2019t had a good invisible man in a while."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh um I should probably get going."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Leonard Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That is insane."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Come on Barry there\u2019s a Swedish team trying to run our experiment before us. Can\u2019t you spare any?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay Sheldon I know I was supposed to return this DVD a long time ago and I know we rented it on your card. But it\u2019s been like seven years and clearly nothing bad has happened. So in-in-in-instead of being a giant pain in the ass like you always are what if this one time you just tried staying calm?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I was sleeping."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"And just so you know it\u2019s only temporary. I\u2019m not gonna get too comfortable."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey. I mean it\u2019s been a little tough but Penny\u2019s following her dreams and in my book that is not depressing."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Are you kidding? He made me sign a waiver participate in an emergency fire drill and take a refresher course in CPR. Thank God he had a dummy."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh uh he\u2019s crazy."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No-one\u2019s going to ask if I spent the night with Raj\u2019s sister."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Why?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Totally you."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh sweet Krishna shake it that-a rupee maker."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I like The Transformers. Do you like The Transformers?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Thank you Penny."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh no no I get a say in it. But I\u2019m sure whoever shows up will be better company than a threesome I\u2019ve been having with Aunt Jemima and Mrs Butterworth."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Uh no I actually came to talk to you."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Almost. Oh what did you put as the one-word description of yourself?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Are you sure you want to do this? Give up your half of the 3-D printer?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No thank you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What about you Stuart? You have a girlfriend yet?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well put. You know I must say I go back and forth on this boyfriend-girlfriend thing but those moments when you worship me really keep you in the running."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"While I\u2019m gone you can think about how mean you were to me."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh don\u2019t feel bad. I never read Leonard\u2019s and I used to sleep with him."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Let\u2019s take every single thing from the other apartment and put it in here."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That is ridiculous."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Maybe you\u2019re right. Wow I am easy to manipulate.  Oh guys it\u2019s Emily. What should I do?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay suit yourself. We\u2019ll probably be trashing Priya a little."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh. Oh now you know I hate change. Say it."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Wait. Are we starting now? Or is that what you\u2019re going to say when we do start or\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Of course not."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"None why?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thank you Sheldon. That must\u2019ve been very hard for you to say."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You see where I\u2019m going with this."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Howard wait. Why don\u2019t you use this instead of the PVC to keep the transverse filter assembly in place?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Really?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Let\u2019s go to the biology lab and find you some nice yummy mice."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No she won\u2019t. I\u2019m great."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It\u2019ll be okay. It\u2019ll be okay.  It\u2019s Howard. Howard hello."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Anything else I should know."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay you know what? This is ridiculous. I\u2019ve been trying to make a connection with you all day and clearly I\u2019m getting nowhere."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Later dude."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well that was rather unpleasant."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh that\u2019s very kind of you. But I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll all have a better time without me. Let\u2019s go Stuart."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No you can\u2019t use that one. That\u2019s mine. Uh try this one for an ice-breaker. Uh despite popular lore there is no place in the continental United States Alaska or Hawaii from which one can dig straight through the centre of the earth and come up in China."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Sorry. Better?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Not according to the work of Berscheid Snyder and Omoto."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Thanks for coming with me."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It wasn\u2019t a pyjama party. It was just a couple of bros hanging out giggling eating cookie dough and watching Princess Bride."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes in fact I am the youngest person ever to win it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh boy. You know ours is a relationship of the mind."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh. Do not sneak up on a guy when he\u2019s sitting on a log."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Now that everything\u2019s out on the table you you think you two will keep living together?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Fellow warriors this is Sheldor the Conqueror. We are about to enter Axel\u2019s fortress. Now this is a long run so let\u2019s do another bladder check. Alright Barry we\u2019ll wait for you again but you really should see a doctor.  Penny are you experiencing some sort of difficulty?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Just for the record my efforts to establish you as the alpha male were not aided by you bursting into tears."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You went out in the hallway stumbled into an interdimensional portal which brought you 5000 years into the future where you took advantage of the advanced technology to build a time machine and now you\u2019re back to bring us all with you to the year 7010 where we are transported to work at the thinkatorium by telepathically controlled flying dolphins?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"From the intercom."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Are you sure?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You know it\u2019s like the baseball movie build it and they will come."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Granted my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox but I think the end result will be a measurable enhancement of Penny\u2019s quality of life."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It wasn\u2019t fun for me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah I wanted to explain."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Padma Kapur Neha Chowdury."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh I\u2019m not sure everyone keep an eye on Howard in case he starts to swell up."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No. Oh no. Now you call her Constance. I call her Meemaw. You have your own Meemaw. It\u2019s not my fault she died when you were four."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No more talking everybody go."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll shut up."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hey Emily listen I\u2019ve been thinking and I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a good idea that I come over."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"The kite you made me lose was an authentic Patang an Indian fighting kite that my brother sent to me from New Delhi. It took me a day to put together and two days to paint. This is Hello Kitty."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You always get your way."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"All right. Imagine yourself in the one place you feel most at home. Where is that?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m sorry but facts are facts."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"No. It\u2019s just one of those times when it\u2019s just you and me. Like when the three of us went to the movies and you and I waited outside the bathroom while Howard threw up Red Vines and Cherry Coke. Do you remember that?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Chicken out. We\u2019re we\u2019re so afraid of getting into trouble that we never do anything wrong."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay that\u2019s a lot of money. The wise thing to do is invest it in something practical. Like a jet ski."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Like who?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Really? Great!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh I\u2019m hanging in there. Thanks for asking."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I bet you told Bernadette all about how he was screwing around with Mandy Chao."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s a risk I\u2019m willing to take."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"h  I love it. Oh that\u2019s great!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Really?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Excuse me. It\u2019s Major Sheldon Cooper. With my last breath I awarded myself a battlefield promotion. It\u2019s kind of a big deal."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah that\u2019s right."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well I\u2019m going to take myself out to a movie tonight. You want to go?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So where do you guys want to go dancing?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sleep."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Is there a problem?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So you told her you wanted to slow things down?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Give me back my parking space."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"In 1890 Emile Dolbear determined that there was a fixed relationship between the number of chirps per minute of the snowy tree cricket and the ambient temperature. A precise relationship that is not present with ordinary field crickets."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"First of all this has only made me stronger. But beyond that all I did was fill out an application."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Great. It\u2019s not like I brought it up because I wanted to go."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Are you sure? He\u2019s small. I bet I can get a nice tight spiral on him."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I forget. Which one is Hammer of the Gods?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Cleaning up is not young and fun."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Check."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s a little stiff. What a remarkably fragile structure to support such a valuable payload. Not unlike balancing a Faberge egg on a Pixie Stick."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It\u2019s all over her Facebook page."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay I\u2019ll give you one more clue. It involved another person."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Wouldn\u2019t you be upset if you saw Amy out with someone else?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So you\u2019re looking to ruin something for her in the funny pages?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"My plan was to jump out at the state line but one of my nose plugs fell into the toilet."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Uh so forgive me forgive me for being nosy but is is there a wedding ring under those pretty rubber gloves?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz is requested to report to the NASA Johnson Space Center Houston Texas for astronaut training Monday eight a.m."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh people get things they don\u2019t deserve all the time. Look at me with you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well I\u2019m sorry but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret so that I could choose whether or not I wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping. You can\u2019t impose a secret on an ex post facto basis."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Wow. I can drink a beer underwater."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Thank you. Yeah I\u2019ll bear that in mind if I\u2019m ever nominated for the Hillbilly Peace Prize."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I did it! I actually did it. Okay now flush him."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What were you doing with rocket fuel in your apartment?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh please understand that it\u2019s not that we don\u2019t want you around but Penny and I occasionally need some alone time."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Leslie. I can\u2019t remember the last time we talked. So much has changed."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"How\u2019d you do?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Then it must be a tumour."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Munching on complimentary popcorn. Woot woot. Oh the gall. I hope his next tweet is popcorn lodged in trachea choking to death woot woot."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What are you doing?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh please we\u2019ve spent our whole lives running away from fights. Personally I can squeeze through a hole in a fence half my size."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"All I\u2019m saying is there\u2019s a time to just listen."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Right. Sorry sir."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Ooh! What\u2019s going on in here?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Ah interesting we\u2019re being accused of making you do things you don\u2019t like and here you are doing the same thing to poor Amy."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You know what? Even though I don\u2019t have a girlfriend I can still have a good time on Valentine\u2019s Day."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Nothing bad happens in The Lake House."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You don\u2019t think that will be awkward?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"A friend at the School of Pharmacology gave me these new pills they\u2019re testing. He says it\u2019s the next big thing for social anxiety disorder."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well Howard thank you. It\u2019s quite a gesture on your part. You\u2019ve shown yourself to be the bigger man."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"She stiffed you?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah I got the same one. And that\u2019s not a bathing suit it\u2019s a tan line."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"In my defence I prefaced that by saying \u201cwith all due respect.\u201d"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s hard to say. I\u2019ve never really lived by myself. What if I become strange and eccentric?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay you can have that one."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"All right Mother. Um have a nice flight."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What did I do?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh good. Um can I tell people that our love burned too bright and too quickly? Kind of a Candle in the Wind deal?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah the point is Higgs is being celebrated for work he did 50 years ago so that got me thinking perhaps I\u2019ve already hit upon the idea that will win me my Nobel prize."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"A little until I saw them in matching tops."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You need to remove that chair from the building. It\u2019s a health hazard."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t know. What if living together kills the romance?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No that doesn\u2019t seem any more likely."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well what do you want to do?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You are because dating two women I mean I can\u2019t even remember the last time I slept in my own apartment. I wake up and I\u2019m like am I at Claire\u2019s or am I at Emily\u2019s? Is there a third girl I\u2019ve forgotten about? Like where am I?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh gee well thankyou for that. But um I think for now Leonard and I are just going to stay friends."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh-uh."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Who? Give me their names. I bet it\u2019s Wolowitz."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh can\u2019t you take the bus to the dentist?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I wonder if he\u2019s listening to our music right now."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Sure of course. Oh actually Emily was gonna spend the night."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And now as promised the tangent. Sheldon and the Hell Hound or How I Lost My Hot Dogs."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh right. Good one."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well I want to go get my asthma inhaler but it might ruin the moment. Just just help me out here. How does a miserable date end in sex?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m Sheldon. How do you do?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"There is an inherent ambiguity in the word dinner. Technically it refers to the largest meal of the day whenever it is consumed so to clarify here by dinner I mean supper."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"And I like to think I helped."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey guys."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sure."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Lucy?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"This isn\u2019t a desk. This is a Brobdingnagian monstrosity."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Aw he has the same look my little nephew gets when he can\u2019t figure out how I got his nose."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"But you made me order it because you were too well-known in the flag community and they\u2019d jack up the price."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You got me. Now what are you going to do with me?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Don\u2019t you see? When we\u2019re all having fun together we\u2019re already winners. Oh look. See? Even I\u2019m a winner."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m fine. Although I\u2019m no longer the master of my own bladder."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"To be truthful Emily and I haven\u2019t dated that long and we never agreed to be exclusive to each other."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Door. "},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"So I guess what I\u2019m saying is I get where Lucy\u2019s coming from."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"So Leonard how are you enjoying Anything Can Happen Thursday?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Wait you don\u2019t remember?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"And that\u2019s not even the best part. See? I have one too. Check it out. You can wear yours and we can have little sword fights whenever we want."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Say the quote again."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Not at all."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Whatever dude. The point is Leonard\u2019s got one and you don\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey Bernadette\u2019s water broke."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"And I doubt the military would be interested in our little guidance system."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Not true. Wil thinks this is a great idea. He was just concerned that he wasn\u2019t a big enough celebrity to headline such an amazing event. Also that\u2019s the same day that he shampoos his beard."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"A lane frequented by liars. Like you you big liar."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I hadn\u2019t spoken to Emily since I broke up with her and she left this on my doorstep with a note."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh man. Scooter sucks. He\u2019s the Aquaman of the Muppet Babies."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No problem. I\u2019ll be back before this banana hits the ground. Zoom zoom zoom zoom! Zoom zoom zoom zoom!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hey fellas I\u2019m thinking about making some freshly brewed iced tea if anyone would like some."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"But Sheldon we don\u2019t have a chance. The only improvement you were able to make on the robot was to put fresh batteries in the remote."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs they are no more alike than any other siblings."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Wow. You\u2019re not only our first astronaut. You\u2019re also the first one of us to kick a girl out of bed. You\u2019re like a rock star."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh too bad. I\u2019ve always wanted to go to Long Beach."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"If you don\u2019t mind I\u2019d like to stop listening to you and start talking."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"One more time?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yeah okay Howard wins."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"He was 84 he\u2019d say where\u2019s my pudding?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Come on Sheldon let\u2019s go home.

Ooh perhaps today is the day we finally find out what\u2019s inside the Magic Eight Ball."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh but I am. Didn\u2019t Penny tell you the good news?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Alright."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Come on guys! Hurry up! Hurry up!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Which means his triumph will be even larger. Minstrels will write songs about him."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Nothing. Let\u2019s go to the party.  How do I look?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Fine then you go."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Good morning everybody. I picked up coffee while I was out. Bernadette here\u2019s your soy peppermint mocha."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hang on. Looks like everyone\u2019s a winner."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Howard do you think maybe sometimes you try too hard?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I would not."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What\u2019s the emergency?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh. Good for you."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"But she did dump you."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Maybe you don\u2019t want someone exactly like you. You know what they say opposites attract."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Ooh. Leonard\u2019s going all alpha nerd on Sheldon\u2019s ass."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No. "},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay look I didn\u2019t want to say this but the real reason I took the painting down was because it made Bernadette very jealous."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Smooth."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay be nice."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh wow that\u2019s so sweet. Hey what\u2019s this?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And send."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay instead of protecting me why don\u2019t you try being excited when something good happens?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Or maybe she\u2019ll finally succeed in ripping my nuts off. There are still 93 ways she hasn\u2019t tried yet. Look Howard I appreciate the effort but this is like the worst date of my life."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well we\u2019re going to go apologise to Raj and invite him out to dinner."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well the night is still young."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Einstein."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well I thought\u2026 Come on I didn\u2019t want anyone to feel bad at the end of the game. And some of those puzzles were really hard and I didn\u2019t know who was gonna get Penny."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right. It was hell."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah probably."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s like there\u2019s a train in your mouth. Howard Oh yeah. I\u2019ve got one. Um the Amtrak Wolverine coming into Chicago. Bwch-wch-wch-wch-wch-wch bwch-wch-wch-wch-wch-wch. Ooo-ooo."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Uh I do.

"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay it\u2019s not a movie. It\u2019s improv. So no one calls action."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"In fact you did but I was referring to Howard."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well actually insects are a dietary staple in many cultures they\u2019re almost pure protein."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I didn\u2019t bring it up.

The tear-stained air mattress in the back of the van."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay so once we receive the next image and compare it to the ones we\u2019ve already collected we\u2019ll know what it is that we found."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sure."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh yeah there he is."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh I\u2019ll check Amazon."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Ooh that is a lot of hair.

Which now that I think about it is not so good."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Both of us."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah I said I\u2019d think about it."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I never said that."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Damn it. I had Lysine and changed it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh sweetie you should really get some money."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh please show me a ten-year-old who knows to dip Tootsie Rolls in Nutella."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You know I think I may have misjudged this restaurant."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh my God."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay now you\u2019re talking like a winner!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh sweetie just forget about it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey you ready to go?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"We\u2019re all out of alcohol."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Seriously? You don\u2019t even have a change of clothes or a toothbrush."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Who wouldn\u2019t? You could zip through a maze in nothing flat squeeze through really small holes and shut down restaurants in a single bound. And the best part is if I were Rat-Man you could be my sidekick Mouse Boy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And you\u2019re going to let her handle my food?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What are you doing?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"This is the beginning of a twenty six hundred year journey we\u2019re going to take together from the ancient Greeks through Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr to Erwin Schrodinger to the Dutch researchers that Leonard is currently ripping off."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":" Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sure."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Thanks.

Brent Spiner Mr. Data himself. You love him."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Aw so cute when you use the word cool wrong. Like when kids say pasghetti."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I don\u2019t get it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh just a little treat. I know you\u2019ve been feeling really bad about your mom lately."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re not going to answer it?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019ve gotten a lot better at that you know. I\u2019ve dated four different women since we broke up and I didn\u2019t tell any of them that I loved them and wanted to have their babies."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I wonder where Dr. Lorvis is. He\u2019s been gone a while."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Fine then I guess it\u2019s two against two. How do we decide?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What you actually want to meet her?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So coke."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sheldon look I will pay you back as soon as I can. You just have to give me more time."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"This is great. Look at me out in the real world of ordinary people just living their ordinary colourless workaday lives."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay wait you\u2019re inviting people to our wedding?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Night of the Living Garlic Bread?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"We don\u2019t mean to interrupt we live across the hall."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Damn."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Texas."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh I\u2019m sorry condescending means\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh cut it in half?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Of course she did. Anyway that\u2019s not what I was gonna say. When I was ten years old I built a hugging machine."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeh why? Eh why? Oh that\u2019s why."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Holy crap! Look!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sure."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You always do this you know? You ditch me for a woman you don\u2019t have a shot with."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Is everything all right?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh that is so thoughtful."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No. We just made out a little."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Excuse me I\u2019m meeting a girl here. It\u2019s kind of our first date."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"All right problem solved."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"We were having a conversation about past lovers."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s not that big a deal. You just go down to the court on Thursday and you pay the fine."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It bothers me."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You don\u2019t have to worry. Unlike Amy and Priya I know how to keep a secret."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Eight o\u2019clock.  Sheldon that pocket watch is ridiculous."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You have a new job."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sheldon I cooked you breakfast. I made your bed. I checked your mouth for thrush. You can rub your own chest."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes. That is the reason. My work is suffering because of all the laid I\u2019m getting."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Thank you Stuart. It\u2019s nice to know."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What\u2026 what kind of a kiss?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Come on I\u2019m sorry."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"How are your crab cakes?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I felt sorry for him. Priya\u2019s giving him a hard time."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"We don\u2019t have any of those."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Or totally naked. I love Howard but the dude needs a little shame."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Why they\u2019re just toys?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well of course but not by myself."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"On the contrary you no longer get to enjoy my charming eccentricities. We\u2019re not friends with benefits."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Penny started taking a class. She wrote a paper she didn\u2019t want me to read it I went behind her back and I read it anyway."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Bernadette told me everything. Now you don\u2019t get the left or the right."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Do I like it? Wow."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh would you stop worrying about that?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh if it\u2019s even the U.S. Military. It could be foreign military pretending to be American."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"But you didn\u2019t even hear the details."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh come on they don\u2019t hate you all right? They\u2019re just a little intimidated. All you need to do is show everyone how sweet you really are."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And I\u2019m sorry I lied about being a wedding planner who can\u2019t find love. Although I am currently single if you know anybody."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right you\u2019ve made your point. A fine prank very amusing. Now get it out."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Don\u2019t be silly. I\u2019m a fan of anything that tries to replace actual human contact."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh I don\u2019t know. But whoever that mystery man was you should be eternally grateful for without him there would be no Leonard\u2019s Day."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I bet it is. Why don\u2019t women like me?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Right games. They took Halo 1 Halo 2 Halo 3 Call of Duty 1 Call of Duty 2 Call of Duty 3 Rock Band Rock Band 2 Final Fantasy 1 thru 9 The Legend of Zelda The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess Super Mario Brothers Super Mario Galaxy Mario and Sonic at the Winter Olympics and Ms. Pacman."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well maybe there\u2019s a way to appear non-aggressive but also be able to protect ourselves if necessary. Like smiling and waving with one hand but the other hand holding the severed head of a tiger."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s after nine o\u2019clock at this hour the streets of Pasadena are teeming with drunken sailors and alley cats."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Pacific Daylight time!"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You got it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You know I do recall seeing some female undergarments. Where was that? Oh yes earlier this evening I happened to gaze out the window and a brassiere caught my eye. Do those look familiar?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"That was before Penny. I make it a rule to only fall for one of my friends\u2019 girlfriends at a time. I\u2019m very old-fashioned that way."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":" Amy?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh my God what happened?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh that\u2019s a nice one. Was it yours when you were little?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You know I just read a study that suggests new mothers are better at sensing emotions for up to two years."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It was Thanksgiving. Uncle Carl said I think there\u2019s a badger living in our chimney. Hand me that flashlight. Those were the last words he ever spoke to us."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019m sorry for bothering you. I\u2019ll hang up now."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"From an orang-u-tan in the primate lab."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Not you. I wasn\u2019t asking you. Penny?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Can we trust him?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Cluck-cluck-cluck."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Any group big enough to trample me to death. General rule of thumb is 36 adults or 70 children."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Or maybe he heard it\u2019s Tator Tot Tuesday. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard sleeps while I play bongos."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah that too. Everything\u2019s broken."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"See this is where everything goes wrong when we talk."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Really? Well then will you explain it to me?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Seventeen. The ogre is amused by your joke and allows you to pass. By the by I liked it too."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"intoxicating isn\u2019t it?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What and let him win? Do I look crazy to you? We\u2019re trying to think down here you geode-loving feldspar jockeys!  And you the notes are C D E G and A. You pick one or I am chopping down that tree!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Kumquat?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Which part?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"This is just half? We\u2019ve been here for hours."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"We don\u2019t get paid? Nothing? Not even a sandwich?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh oh uh you could uh stand outside his window with a boom box in the air."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t know the future. Do you think there\u2019s a chance that an asteroid could hit the Earth destroying Feynman\u2019s house and everyone in it?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well good for you buddy. We\u2019ll let you get back in there."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It was our first date there was an awkward silence. What was I supposed to say?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Like there\u2019s a difference."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"We lived together 13 years. How can you be so awful to me?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s a lot of money for only one colour."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t know. She already thinks I don\u2019t support this so if I call it might look like I\u2019m checking up on her."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m not a child. I know the word ninny."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Fine I\u2019ll do it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"All right Pictionary. What are the teams?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m glad you asked. I took the liberty of adapting a Star Trek fan fiction novella I wrote when I was ten into a one-act play."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Wow. I-I don\u2019t know what to s\u2026 Wow."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Apparently I called Stephen Hawking last night."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Three months. This is gonna be great!"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I\u2019m not an alcoholic."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m glad you had a nice time with Amy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Thank you. If you think about it Greek food isn\u2019t that far from italian food. They share a spice palette. And what a civilization is the Greeks. They gave us science democracy and little cubes of charred meat that taste like sweat."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Morning."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No. Yeah. But you know what the second-worst part is? He does not miss me at all."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Excuse me. Thirty what under thirty what to watch what?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I was not thinking it. Although now that you point it out it is undeniable."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s not yours? Oh my. How embarrassing for both of us."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What.  Howard brought a date?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Come on Leonard if you roll a six Penny dies horribly in a nuclear meltdown. See what I mean when I say the fun is real?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So by friend do you mean friend friend gay friend or ex boyfriend who you\u2019re now platonic with but still might have a thing for you friend\u201d?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah you wrote it on my hand."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay. Okay you\u2019re right. It\u2019s time for me to step up and take responsibility for my life. Be a man.  Hello Mummy."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m okay. Just a little mouthwash and then I\u2019m gonna rock your world. "},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Once again unbelievable."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What if I told you that over the past few months Amy has secretly been giving you little puzzles to test your intelligence against chimpanzees in her lab?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Actually I\u2019m at The Cheesecake Factory."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"That\u2019s okay. I can come back later."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Actually he can. The Hindu Code of Manu is very clear in these matters. If a woman\u2019s father is not around the duty of controlling her base desires falls to the closest male member of her family in this case Raj. The code also states that if she disobeys she will be reborn in the womb of a jackal and tormented by diseases. If true that seems like an awfully large gamble given that the prize is Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Bite me!"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hey Leonard did you see my limo downstairs."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Howard and Bernadette\u2019s kid might be born on your birthday. How cool is that?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Can we take a moment to discuss that I just lied to the government for you?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right colour me intrigued."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes I\u2019m inviting people to our wedding. Yeah I\u2019ve already asked Stephen Hawking and Robert Downey Jr and now don\u2019t get your hopes up \u2019cause he\u2019s pretty busy but Erno Rubik."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Terrific. Um this party is my first chance for Penny to see me in the context of her social group and I need you not to embarrass me tonight."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No but if things don\u2019t work out with me and Leonard I\u2019ll give you a call. Wait. How much do you talk about Star Trek?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Is that a real book? I would totally read that book."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wait. I just want you all to know that I forgive you. This mutiny isn\u2019t your fault it\u2019s mine. I haven\u2019t earned these bars. Although what I lack in leadership apparently I more than make up for in sewing."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh dad that\u2019s nice but Leonard has to work. Right Leonard?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Wow centrifugal force!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No I crossed in the middle of the street. And normally I wouldn\u2019t but I saw an aggressive-looking Girl Scout and it was the heart of cookie season. Anyway there was a police officer and he witnessed the whole thing."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019m just saying that after everything you\u2019ve been through you get to look into each other\u2019s eyes and say \u201cI love you.\u201d And that\u2019s beautiful."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah I know. They called it the greatest thing since the Communist party. Although I\u2019m pretty sure that the Communist party made them say that. I like China. See they know how to keep people in line."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Koo from Koothrappali and per from Cooper."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"My point is we\u2019re a couple and I like you for who you are quirks and all."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No. Sheldon we\u2019re getting married."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"No way Jose."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Nobody\u2019s up in anybody\u2019s business let\u2019s just buy our stuff and go."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I feel bad for whoever gets that phone call."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Not just a sticker. That is a sticker of a kitty saying me-wow."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Ah!"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hi. I\u2019m good. Really good. Well I don\u2019t know why I said really good. I\u2019m just regular good. I really just wanted to sound confident. And that really was a real really not a fake really like the first really."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh yeah you too."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Here."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Seriously. I feel like I\u2019ve got a fish tank in my pelvis."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Thank you for carving a smiley face in my grilled cheese sandwich."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hello. Sorry I\u2019m late. I also got you a balloon but it floated away and I chased it for a while."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Right here. Use your finger."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Is something bothering you?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It is."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"But you\u2019re not Princess Punchali."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You got it. Well Penny might want to join us."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay okay. I\u2019m gonna show you what\u2019s in the box. But just promise not to flip out."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes ma\u2019am."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Ding ding ding ding ding."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"With what?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh what the hell. "},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah and this one won\u2019t stain my teeth purple."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"No you didn\u2019t. There are millions of data points there."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well what was the plan?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Let me finish."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"They also don\u2019t care for it if you stare at them and hyperventilate. Sadly that\u2019s my home run swing."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Don\u2019t be silly."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"No but when I was six years old I tried to start a boy band called Frankie Goes to Bollywood. But I couldn\u2019t get any other boys to join so my parents asked the servants to be my backup dancers. Wait when you sign servants don\u2019t sign it like I\u2019m bragging. Sign it in a way that I sound humble with just a hint of that\u2019s right I had servants."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t care! I\u2019m losin\u2019 it man!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"12 years after high school and I\u2019m still at the nerd table."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay well I\u2019ve been poking around the internet and I think I found something we\u2019ll enjoy watching even more."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You were right. I can\u2019t get out of here."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"April 12th 2005 Bob\u2019s Big Boy Toluca Lake. Raj had just introduced us to Priya for the first time and she was enjoying the sweet taste of Hindu rebellion in the form of a Bob\u2019s Super Big Boy hamburger. In order to preserve your friendship you and Howard made a pinky swear that neither of you would attempt to woo her. I had a patty melt."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Do you have those little marshmallows?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Here\u2019s the problem. I was clearly signed up to use the mainframe in Buckman 204 and Dr Winkle just wantonly ripped the sign-up sheet off the wall."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey how were things on the set?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"There\u2019s kissing in Star Trek smarty-pants."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I didn\u2019t know what else to do he\u2019s lost all focus every day he\u2019s got a new obsession.  This is a particularly disturbing one."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It\u2019ll be okay. It\u2019ll be okay.  It\u2019s Howard. Howard hello."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Did you meet anyone interesting there perhaps a promiscuous redheaded barmaid?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard explain it to her."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Uh we were actually gonna do it here."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Raj would you ever try an experiment like that with Emily?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh come on he\u2019s just going to play with it twice and then it\u2019ll end up in his closet with all the other junk."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah right."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Now."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh my pleasure and don\u2019t worry about your presentation today. You\u2019re gonna be great."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No she won\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Wish I knew. He\u2019s fine with Pluto."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey guys this package came for y\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"See? We both think so."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"And you thought they all had a silver lining."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Are you sure?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Good idea. And since you\u2019ve had such a rough day I\u2019m gonna let you throw the pie in Leonard\u2019s face."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Good for you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sheldon?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Why are you speaking English?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m sorry what did I say?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Uh yeah I mean her serve was pretty good."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay for the final touch this is an eyelash curler. You just place it on your lashes and squeeze it closed."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Come on Sheldon you got this."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Is that a real thing?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Come on Raj we\u2019re ready to start."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh really? Okay well would a baby have to shave once every 11 days?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Ah I do so love beverages. Now I think I\u2019ll take my after-dinner walk."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Who\u2019s ready to laugh?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"They seem okay with it."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You know Tor the God of Tunder. As I was saying is this a sign that our society is approaching gender equality?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s close enough."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Dark and fun."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Now now you denigrated the memory of a great civil rights pioneer. That\u2019s all anyone could ask."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Why do you people hate sleep? Are you wearing my robe?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"If Batman were bitten by a radioactive Man-Bat and then fought crime disguised as Man-Bat would he be Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Man or simply Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Batman?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah but us monkeys doesn\u2019t pop. Oh oh oh oh wait we monkeys there you go. Hey when can we start running tests on it?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Look. A new topical antihistamine with lidocaine. Wow. I can\u2019t wait until I get a rash."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay look it\u2019s not really about Ricardo and Tondelaya. It is really about her boss who doesn\u2019t quite know how to handle this situation and could use your advice which is surprising because Dr. Einstein Von Brainstorm he\u2019s usually pretty smart about these things."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh we\u2019re not exchanging gifts."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re here a lot now."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Very well. Shall we switch topics to Isaac Newton v. Gottfried Leibniz?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hmm let me think. Nothing. I\u2019m a delight."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Don\u2019t blow too hard. If you pop him I will vomit."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Why can\u2019t Leonard teach you?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No I can do this. I just I just need another energy drink. Oh no."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh so follow him."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Interesting. Penny\u2019s current suitor asking advice from her former suitor."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You know this is my day off Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"True but thanks to meditation I am able to stay in the same room with them without urinating. Now close your eyes."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Excuse me.  A couple of circulars nothing important."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"It\u2019s a chocolate chip cookie."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Please yes."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"When it\u2019s done charging. Or you land on the time machine. Obviously."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"But you don\u2019t have a life-threatening condition. Why would you take the risk of surgery?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"According to a classic psychological experiment by Yerkes and Dodson in order to maximize performance one must create a state of productive anxiety. So I\u2019d like to ask you all to do something for me. Keep me on my toes. Just throw me off my game. Essentially go out of your way to make my life miserable."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh here\u2019s another one. I wish that the apple pancake mix was on the top shelf because it starts with an A but I don\u2019t put it there because I don\u2019t want you breaking one of your little legs when you\u2019re supposed to be making my breakfast."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"And when you go to a Chinese restaurant he always gets the same fortune in his fortune cookie."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Alright let me put it this way. Your gross receipts on this one order will be over $3000 for one night\u2019s work."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"All right I\u2019ll get rid of him. But you owe me one."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh yeah right. Sorry. My name is Puss in Boots. You killed my father. Prepare to die."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Be more specific."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Cool. Did she discover a cure for something?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay maybe this will help. Imagine you\u2019re holding a pen. Before you go too far not a special pen with your initials engraved on it that\u2019ll make the next part really hard."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well I\u2019ve been crunching the numbers and so far I\u2019ve gotten your probability of death all the way to a sphincter-tightening one in 300."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Not if you\u2019re a rugby team."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wow. Didn\u2019t see that coming."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t understand. If you were in a non-emotional relationship then why are you having  what appears be an emotional response?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh not just date night our fifth anniversary."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"So was my dad. And then he did."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Why don\u2019t you put your mother in a home?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You have a Bat Signal?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You\u2019re right. You\u2019re absolutely right. I should have been honest with you and told you the gift was too much."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh it\u2019s what controls the arm."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Or worse up."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well there\u2019s nothing you can do about it so relax sit back enjoy the clickety-clack of the steel wheels on the polished rails."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Before you leave could you test these noise-cancelling headphones?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Penny while I subscribe to the many worlds theory which posits the existence of an infinite number of Sheldons in an infinite number of universes I assure you that in none of them am I dancing."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Howard has a hairy chest?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Snipe!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Do you know what he\u2019s doing?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2026 I\u2026 I don\u2019t understand. Your grandmother\u2019s alive?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You know who\u2019s apparently very smart is the girl who played TV\u2019s Blossom. She got a PhD in neuroscience or something."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Fine."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Don\u2019t worry I can take a hint. No more murder mystery parties."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You know what I\u2019m thinking? I\u2019m thinking Howard wasn\u2019t making a back-scratching metaphor. I\u2019m thinking there was some actual scratching involved."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I don\u2019t want to hug you either.

You brought fancy wine and made fondue. I\u2019ve slept with guys for less. It\u2019s a joke. Based on real events."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Perhaps I will. This rock encapsulates all my negative emotions. I will cast you far away. Feel free to take out a pigeon while you\u2019re at it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right. But this better not be some elaborate scheme to get me out of my shirt."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You don\u2019t shove them.

We\u2019ve got a hit."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hang on a sec. Why do you get first crack at her?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yes. That is a real thing. And it doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t care about each other it just means things are moving at a pace you\u2019re not comfortable with and that\u2019s fine."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You continue to underestimate me my good man."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Goodnight. "},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Although now that I think about it Leonard would never go swimming in public without his swim shirt."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"But they\u2019ll know I\u2019m not you.

No look at me. I had an engagement ring to give a girl and instead she rejected me. And am I emotional about that?

I can leave whenever I want."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019d like to propose a toast. The dream to go up into space is one we all share and Howard\u2019s making that a reality. We\u2019re all very proud of you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"All right so we\u2019ll ask him to come back."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right how\u2019s this for revenge?

You know why couldn\u2019t she just like Ziggy? Yeah? That thing\u2019s riddled with plot holes."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay I I I think it\u2019s safe to say that we\u2019ve all done some things we\u2019re not particularly proud of. But come on we\u2019re friends. Friends overlook each other\u2019s minor lapses. For the record Howard I\u2019m sorry that I broke our pact."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No idea. All I know is I\u2019m gonna be working on the railroad all the livelong day."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"All right we\u2019re down the rabbit hole. What are you doing?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Like you could get a brown bear."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"This has nothing to do with my sperm count."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Really they have your little name label in them."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Can you believe this guy?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No I mean just you and me."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Before Emily I was alone for so long. I just I don\u2019t know if I can do that again."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Article 10 subsection C if questioned Penny may not say that everything is fine if it isn\u2019t. Other unacceptable responses include it\u2019s nothing don\u2019t worry about it and I said it\u2019s nothing don\u2019t worry about it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay I think I understand."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"So I have an idea for a filk song. It\u2019s kind of a a power ballad superhero crossover tale of epic proportions."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Empedocles thought he was a god and jumped into a volcano. And Pythagoras had an irrational fear of beans. Tesla fell madly in love with a pigeon who he claimed loved him back."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh hey guys."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Like this?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh yes. In my culture it\u2019s expected to have a chaparone to oversee a first date. Plus I want to make a good impression and no offence but with you guys here I look like six two."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay uh here it is. I met this girl and I kissed her and I feel terrible about it. But it\u2019s done it\u2019s never gonna happen again. And I am so so sorry."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Very well thank you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hmm?

I love you. And then maybe she could touch me in a special way."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh hey. What\u2019s up?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You\u2019ve been doing it all day. Do you even know what an insult is?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"And that\u2019s how Mommy and Daddy met."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Junior Mints are pretty apologetic."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh brilliant.

Get closer."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh I\u2019m just trying to find the stupid next of kin to this stupid video store owner so I can return the DVD and see the look on Sheldon\u2019s stupid face when he sees that I didn\u2019t let this get to me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh right no I\u2019m lactose intolerant."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It is kind of cute."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh good that was an unusual interaction.

And I certainly don\u2019t need someone telling on me to my mother."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"October sixth."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Not yet this is fun. Ooh I know.

Cooper and Hofstadter resorting to juvenile attempts at humour is proof they have nothing to back up their ridiculous paper. It should come as no surprise given they work at Cal Tech essentially a technical school where even the physicists are basically engineers. Engineers? Do you know how insulting that is?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Perhaps you\u2019re right. I\u2019m sorry for my behaviour. I\u2019ve had alcohol and it\u2019s caused me to be inappropriate."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"He made you his screensaver."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"But I can\u2019t have one."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Are you still mad about the sperm bank?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Right."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh damn it!"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"The polite response is thank you for noticing."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"So when they ride horses and fly on the birds they also use their ponytails."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re right. I should embrace the chaos."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Maybe if we\u2019re quiet he\u2019ll go away."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh it\u2019s all right.

You accept an invitation to a party at the home of my sworn enemy he tells everyone we\u2019re going to be there and when we don\u2019t show he looks the fool. Fiendishly clever."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Superman doesn\u2019t sweat on Earth."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay just tell me is it too soon to join a quest to the Black Castle?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And I have nothing to contribute to this conversation.

Leonard doesn\u2019t trim his nose hair. He thinks because he\u2019s short nobody can see up there."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Anything else?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"If you think that\u2019s more fun than talking to Zachary Quinto through a stall door you\u2019re crazy."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"This should be fun."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well it\u2019s like that science thing. For every action you have a gigantic and annoying reaction."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Just for the record I did not want to be a part of this."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Don\u2019t you think if a woman was living with me I\u2019d be the first one to know about it?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":" Let me point out that two degrees can be the difference between water and steam."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Like how women often forget the pain of childbirth."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"How can I call her you know I can\u2019t talk to women."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You don\u2019t have to you should want to."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"See?

How do you know that?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well I\u2019d like to point out I voted for orang-utan but you shouted me down. ."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I swear I am on your side."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Thank you. That\u2019s why I say Keaton\u2019s number one. He brought a sense of humour to the role."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Playing the theremin."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Bye Cinnamon.

Genius here wants to catch a bird with a garbage bag and a Slim Jim."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So you\u2019re like one of those beautiful mind genius guys."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You want me to throw him out?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You guys are the worst. Thank you I think that was helpful."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What did you do?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I agree. It\u2019s the juxtaposition of the high-tech nature of space exploration against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet that provides the comic fodder here. Check your messages."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That long huh?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I don\u2019t know where your pants are but we did find your underwear in a pot on the stove."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Actually I have a plastic baggy strapped to my leg that says I can.

Sheldon\u2019s being reasonable."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay here we go. You find yourselves in the smoking remains of Santa\u2019s village.

Your tone of voice your body language\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh if only I had his confidence. I have such difficulty speaking to women. Or around women.

That\u2019s not going to happen no. What I need you to do is find a Valentine\u2019s gift for my girlfriend."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well since Amy\u2019s going do you want me there? You know to support you?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Uh from Stuart at the comic-book store."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sure but let\u2019s go out here where there\u2019s a little less yelling and guilt.

How did you get into this place?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"They never do."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh. You poor thing. You have one arrow in your quiver and you just can\u2019t use it.

I\u2019m not here."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Interrupting physi\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey Sheldon are you coming?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hold on to that thought. "},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well I always figured it was to study us discover our weaknesses and report back to your alien overlords."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Not me I\u2019m a hundred percent honest in all of my relationships."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Ooh ooh! What about we make your astronaut nickname Howard \u201cBuzz\u201d Wolowitz?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Of course. He will hear it as an attempt to mend fences as opposed to the withering condemnation you and I will know it to be."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Won\u2019t it also be weird if I have to say hello to you every morning on my way to work and you\u2019re living in a refrigerator box and washing your hair with rain water?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Why?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Fine you want something to do? There\u2019s about six months of data on this hard drive. Why don\u2019t you go through it and see if you can spot any patterns or anomalies."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Amy this isn\u2019t easy to say. All relationships are difficult but even more so when you\u2019re in one with a person who struggles with everyday social interactions. And frankly who can strike some people as being kind of a weirdo."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"And you wonder why other children beat you with books. Cheers!"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yes but she doesn\u2019t. So get signing hand monkey."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t want to talk about it.

He\u2019s on his way here now."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well don\u2019t get me wrong. Neurobiology\u2019s nothing more than the science of gray squishy stuff. But you know when it connects to physics gas up the Ford Martha we\u2019re going for a drive."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I have to say I slept splendidly. Granted not long but just deeply and well."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Although I knew the line doesn\u2019t make me Nathan Fillion."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Maybe this time he\u2019s going to do it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You really think I belong with Benedict Arnold and Judas?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well why don\u2019t you go to a coffee shop."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"The horror!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019ll be able to return to work tomorrow."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"May I present live from New Delhi Dr and Mrs V. M. Koothrappali."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"That\u2019s nice. I haven\u2019t had much success meeting people online."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So Leonard how about it?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well I went over to Mike\u2019s to make up with him."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh. Done and done."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What\u2019s wrong with you?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Got it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh yes. In fact I improved upon it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Walked right out the door."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Like who?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No Leonard this is going to haunt me for the rest of my life. Every science classroom every periodic table every textbook this mistake will be staring back at me. Like that time you let Koothrappali wax your eyebrows. I\u2019ve got to find a way to stop this thing."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon what is it?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"We know we know because burning something down for the insurance money is a crime."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No six thirty\u2019s great."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh a clever albeit obsolete euphemism for insufficient blood flow to the male sex organ."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Godzilla clause?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay yeah."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Goth food."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Of course I would never make fun of you."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well come on we won\u2019t tell anyone."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah well I have street smarts."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well no not socially. But you know just at work."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"None of that is true."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hey guys."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Blah blah blah a typical Taurus. So seriously are we going to see you Saturday?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Baloney okay? You two are as afraid of hurting someone\u2019s feelings as I am."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No sir no I took my dad\u2019s desk chair attached a Speak & Spell to it and made my sister push me up and down the block to trick or treat. Granted most people thought I was R2-D2 but still I got a lot of candy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Where were you that\u2019s more important than Wii bowling night?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh thanks. They are cute aren\u2019t they?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I do. I have the drive to the hospital right here. That is if you make it to the car without falling down the stairs. And don\u2019t expect me to carry you I do that enough in life."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay I\u2019m confused. Which one is Mr. Robot?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You are so funny."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That\u2019s fine \u2019cause actually you\u2019re not invited."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I know she\u2019s so thoughtful."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well I guess it goes back to when I was a fat kid in India and didn\u2019t have any friends."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I just know the longer we wait to talk about it the weirder it gets."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"We went to the comic book store last night."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Are you an element in the actinoid series?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"It\u2019s a chocolate chip cookie."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"If Sheldon\u2019s testosterone dipped he\u2019d become a butterfly.  Oh. Maybe someone\u2019s here to apologize."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Can I sit in your spot?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hold on. Wil and Amy had an argument?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Mmm not bad. You know in medieval times idle chatter was punished with a device called the scold\u2019s bridle. It\u2019s an iron cage that\u2019s locked around the head and pierces the tongue."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey you\u2019re in a good mood."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wait. They might be hostile."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I can\u2019t remember a time you guys weren\u2019t in my life."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m trying to take more of an interest in other people\u2019s lives."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"To the comic book store. You\u2019re probably thinking the comic book store? On a Thursday? Why I\u2019ve fallen down the rabbit hole and into a land of madness. What you have failed to take into account Penny is that this is Anything Can Happen Thursday."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No no of course not. Just have your relationship someplace else."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hello."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay I\u2019ll get those drinks started for you."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"There\u2019s a new sports bar over on Colorado Ave\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Are we gonna be much longer?

Um why don\u2019t we go around the room say your name and why you broke up with me. Want to kick it off?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"We heard you read the letter from Howard\u2019s father."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Because as it just so happens I\u2019m also spending the day with a beloved children\u2019s television science personality. Isn\u2019t that right new friend and colleague Bill Nye the Science Guy. Sorry I replaced you with a newer model."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay. Here\u2019s where we derive the mass of the dark matter particle."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Let me ask you a question. Do you believe you\u2019re going to go to hell for eating sweet and sour pork?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s a blindingly clever play on words. By appropriating his character\u2019s name and adding the S we imply that we we\u2019ll be the crushers of Wesley."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh I\u2019ll make a motion but you\u2019re not going to like it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I believe you. I\u2019d believe you more if you threw a few Apple Jacks in here."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Baby\u2019s listening."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I can\u2019t believe it. This whole time a small part of me thought he was lying."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh oh uh looks like they\u2019re getting ready to let people in."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Who forgot to crack the window?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well that last Hunger Games was not my cup of tea."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well I\u2019ve been quite enjoying that. It combines all the superhero fun of Spider-Man with all the body-switching shenanigans of Freaky Friday. Both versions original and Lohan."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Did you get the part?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m getting enraged."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"In fact I want you to keep the apartment flag and I\u2019m not just saying that because it touched your genitals."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"How late?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What the balls is forty-three?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh come on we\u2019ll be quiet."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I guess he just hates fun."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What a douche."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Snort it down and keep eating!"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Why are you being like this?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Why not?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No no no no no. You just need you just need you just need to map it out. Come on I\u2019ll help you. So uh you stopped at the stream and you turned north three times?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"How did you deal with it?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I will take that action."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay how about you just dip your toe in and meet one of them?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"He just left another comment."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m good I\u2019m good to go."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"He went to the movies without me. It was the only option. I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t understand which social situation this is. Could you give me some guidance as to how to proceed?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh no. Mrs. Mary Cooper didn\u2019t raise her no liars."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Why would you say you wanted to go if you didn\u2019t?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No. Anyway when I was eight a Montgomery-Ward delivery van ran over our cat Lucky."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You see I was at the doctor\u2019s office the folder was right there so I took a peek."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Not yet."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I did. You know I\u2019m not even sure how accurate it was. I took it to the train store it said everyone was sad."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You just got off the list. Would you like back on it? This\u2019ll just take a moment. It\u2019s on a five and a quarter inch floppy."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Just play a potion card."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Building on building on that there\u2019s a new build-your-own pizza place on Colorado."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Where did that even come from did he say we were?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Um uh uh uh we don\u2019t have an appointment and and we don\u2019t belong here but we we\u2019re like crazy-big fans. I mean uh buh buh crazy for Star Wars crazy not crazy like we have a backpack full of duct tape although we do have a backpack that you really don\u2019t want to look in."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What? No!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"All right but just for the record I checked in with you to see how you\u2019d feel about it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s happening.

Professor Proton is coming to our house."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"All right hey you two we\u2019re here for Howard right now okay?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah yeah a little."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So all we need to do is get Sheldon knocked up."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No one ever bought me drinks at a bar because my brain just popped out of my shirt."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Twenty six hundred years?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh. We\u2019re scientists."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What were you doing at Penny\u2019s?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Go. "},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah I thought so too but she\u2019s acting very strangely. I was discussing it with a Sri Lankan fellow on the bus and he hypothesized that a tiger may have recently run across her shadow. Although he may have just been trying to drum up business for his brother-in-law\u2019s witch doctor practice."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey how about we stay the night and hit Legoland in the morning?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Ooh somebody call the burn ward.

Leonard not jealous."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You mean your acting career?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"This might be a good time to point out Howard that friendship requires a certain give and take. Hold the door!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It doesn\u2019t matter."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Bye."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well when someone looks at your dating profile the first thing they see is your picture. I just want to make sure you look fun and full of life and not like a body they just pulled out of the river. All right here we go and smile. Okay uh-uh that one\u2019s in the bank. How about this? Turn away and then turn back into it. But when you do imagine the camera is the girl you want to meet."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That\u2019s not true."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That\u2019s very sweet. But we were thinking more of us maybe living together with\u2026 not you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And of course the answer is Technetium."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You don\u2019t want strippers? You\u2019re the king of strippers. The one club in North Hollywood named a pole after you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"She really is."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Spring wedding?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh I don\u2019t know.

We have an actual fan."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Who\u2019s Professor Proton?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You changed the address on the building? What about mail?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You know also if they did have coitus we\u2019ll all be needing a skilled psychiatrist."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I think what Penny meant is the thought of you two in a mine is kind of funny it\u2019s like a cat riding a Roomba."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah you know what\u2019s not normal? Blubbering about emotions during a flag show. Unless that emotion is excitement over New Zealand changing their flag. Yeah good luck you crazy Kiwis we\u2019re rooting for you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh wait stop that."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What\u2019s neat is that they can maintain angular momentum indefinitely."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Uh I\u2019m Penny.

If you\u2019re interested I\u2019m selling this. It\u2019s only two years old 16 gigabytes of RAM Intel core i7 processor and I can personally guarantee it has spent less than 20 minutes resting on an astronaut\u2019s penis."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re right."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re biologists. Biology is the study of living things. That\u2019s a living thing get cracking."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Of course. I\u2019d be happy to shred it on my ax."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Keep going buddy you\u2019re doing great."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh my God I\u2019m crying already."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay come on. We are not old boring people. We can do better than this."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You know I think this is a good stopping point. Uh it\u2019s your first real game. I threw a lot of information at you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hi."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Ready to get started?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Probably not."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah. I said no."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I made your favourite. Pizza bagels."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":" Penny."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sheldon you big weirdo I want you to know that I love that you\u2019re in my life."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"As a matter of fact I do. I\u2019m gonna comfort her because I\u2019m a caring and decent friend who\u2019s happy to be there when she needs someone to talk to."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Got him. When Gandhi advocated his philosophy of non-violence I bet he didn\u2019t know how much fun it was killing stuff."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It was before my growth spurt."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"See? Right there. You\u2019re a grown man you should be able to pick whichever hobbit you want. Wish you wouldn\u2019t but one problem at a time."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Precisely I didn\u2019t do anything. Now does someone feel like checking her emotional math?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"No. We are very wealthy. But the only difference is we have more servants."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Want of understanding? What does that even mean?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What? Why me?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Great."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"When I\u2019m feeling low I have sex with a girl. But that\u2019s just me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I am truly sorry for what happened last night I take full responsibility. And I hope that it won\u2019t colour your opinion of Leonard who is not only a wonderful guy but also I hear a gentle and thorough lover.  I did what I could."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What about if you went out with me?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I can\u2019t believe we actually did it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah you do. You dog you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Or you might think she thinks you think it\u2019s a date even though she doesn\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hey."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes well apparently neither does anyone else."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hey. Where are the guys?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Cats Sheldon. You\u2019re clearly upset about Amy being gone and you\u2019re trying to replace her with a bunch of cats."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Actually no he goes to the bathroom at eight a.m. with optional follow-ups at one forty-five and seven ten high-fibre Fridays."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Great."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"This is delicious. Where\u2019d you learn to make chili?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Aren\u2019t you worried that sitting in the lobby for a long period of time might attract the attention of the hotel detective?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh great. She\u2019s smart insightful and she has a very unique way of you know revering me."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Look come on Amy look let us make it up to you. We\u2019ll have a girl\u2019s night we\u2019ll do whatever you want."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh wow is the evening over."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well I\u2019m not going to dignify that with a response."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"If you want you can find out right now."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You know I\u2019m a big believer in breaking bad news to a guy when you\u2019re in bed with him. That\u2019s how I told my high school boyfriend I slept with his brother. That\u2019s how I told his brother the same thing."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Regardless coronary problems are eminently treatable. What\u2019s more likely going to kill Howard\u2019s mother are the antibiotic-resistant super-bugs festering in every nook and cranny of this hospital."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No no no. I\u2019m really good at this. All right give me a hint. Does it involve difficulty initiating a stream of anything?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No no no Amy wait. I know it\u2019s not the night you had in mind but why don\u2019t you guys stay and play with us? It\u2019ll be fun."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yeah well I don\u2019t like bugs okay? They freak me out."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Because when I use my regular voice I feel like I\u2019m making fun of them."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Terrific. Now all that\u2019s left is for you to invite me to come me to ask are you sure you to say absolutely and then me to bring it home with how could I say no to that face?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Look I get it but before we pass up on an incredible opportunity I was thinking about when Howard was training to go to space they put him in a simulated environment."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"If you do that i\u2019ll win in eight moves. I\u2019ll win in five moves. I\u2019ll win in one move."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Beverley you know I hold you in high esteem. Can we skip the part where you pretend not to know the answer and get to the part where you tell me the answer?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re lactose intolerant."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Fine but don\u2019t expect my help."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"We\u2019re not kicking him out. Stuart and I have become good friends."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Uh look you and I haven\u2019t made any commitments to each other."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Are you kidding me?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Huh! Sorry!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Screw it I\u2019m going."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"We don\u2019t even know what time they\u2019re gonna be there."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well prepare to be mortified. I let my dog eat food out of my mouth not because she likes it but because I do. Also I know they\u2019re pretty but I\u2019m scared of butterflies."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh I forgot to tell you we\u2019re gonna meet up with Bernadette to spy on Amy and her date."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Mm-hmm."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"A-All right um how about this. When when Winnie the Pooh got his head stuck in the honey tree his friends all grabbed onto him and pulled and pulled."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well you say it like it\u2019s easy. Have any one of you ever broken up with anyone?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What? I apologized and I meant it. I know that we don\u2019t play this game very often but you\u2019re doing it wrong."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You\u2019re ten seconds away from getting crushed. Nine eight."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh gee dad Leonard can\u2019t stay. He just dropped by to say hello. Thanks for stopping by sweetie. I\u2019ll see you later.  Bye."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hmm."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I want you right now to give me your 100% honest opinion."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You want me to get eye surgery?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"All I\u2019m saying is if they took all the money they spent trying to make a decent Hulk movie they could probably just make an actual Hulk."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Bees talk to each other by dancing. Whales have their songs."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Don\u2019t you think looking for a new city to live in is a bit of an overreaction?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Like what?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I couldn\u2019t even think of anyone else while you were gone."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Uh it\u2019s tonight but it\u2019s first-come first-served so we should probably get there early and wait in line."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"We make everyone feel awkward. That\u2019s our thing."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay let\u2019s do this."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Come on Sheldon open the door."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay well how about this? From the university Web site 7pm to 10pm Norton Hall Multipurpose Room mixer for grad students and faculty of the science and humanities departments. Whether you split atoms or infinitives this is the place to be."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right one bacon cheeseburger breaking two Jewish dietary restrictions simultaneously kudos. Beer-battered fish and chips. Now here\u2019s your tartar sauce. I also brought you salsa. It\u2019s a little unconventional but I think you\u2019ll like it. It\u2019s zingy. And for you Factory Burrito Grande no cheese no sour cream no ugly consequences from your lactose intolerance. Bon app\u00e9tit."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Your big problem is me telling her."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah and we\u2019ll be right across the hall."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Anyway she got here today and she\u2019s just been in my apartment yakkety-yakking about every guy she\u2019s slept with in Omaha which is basically every guy in Omaha and washing the sluttiest collection of underwear you have ever seen in my bathroom sink."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s going on that stupid self-centred bastard wrote about our sex life in his blog.

Give me the dice I want to roll."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well if you\u2019d like we could call him. I mean that you could call him. As I\u2019ve explained the absence of my friends does not cause me pain. As rock and roll bad boy Paul Simon once said I am a rock I am an i-i-i-island."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What qualifies you to attempt to understand my mind?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You know if it makes you feel any better\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Good night."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No it was funny.

Spill."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No no. We designed an experiment involving you. See? Now isn\u2019t that interesting?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"He got us again."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hold on. How did you get him in the car?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Dr. Lorvis what are you doing here?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"On the other hand I think Sheldon might be the larval form of his species and someday he\u2019ll spin a cocoon and emerge two months later with moth wings and an exoskeleton."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well it\u2019s a bar so pretty good. Uh what\u2019s new?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That didn\u2019t happen."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh. Hey what smells so good?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What about you Sheldon? Do you have any plans tonight?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Foamy vengeance."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay okay that-that came out wrong but you have to admit you all had a wonderful time."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh Research Lab is more than a game. It\u2019s like the slogan says the physics is theoretical but the fun is real."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay hold on\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m just saying sometimes Raj and I feel pushed aside."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well okay with the Indian food the pizza the Thai food the tank of gas the frozen yogurt and your rent uh a little over fourteen hundred dollars."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I told you before bears are terrifying."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You can\u2019t replace me with Zack."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay. Okay thank you. Oh if she\u2019s scared you can sing to her. She likes Katy Perry. Oh but don\u2019t do Firework that gets her all riled up."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You would do that for me?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It changed."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"If we\u2019re going to change the topic from jellyfish I\u2019d be okay with brine shrimp or the history of the unicycle."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Isn\u2019t it five thirty in the morning there?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Because I know exactly the kind of guy you would\u2019ve ended up with."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No. No no that that would be underreacting. He did break the implied confidentiality of the bedroom and in your case the elevator parks and fast food franchise."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well I\u2019d ask you guys if you want dessert but I know Sheldon doesn\u2019t eat dessert on Tuesdays. And even if Raj wanted something he couldn\u2019t tell me. Howard won\u2019t order anything but he will come up with some sort of skeevy comment involving the words pie or cheesecake. And Leonard\u2019s lactose intolerant so he can\u2019t eat anything here without his intestines blowing up like a balloon animal."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hey you busy?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I do it\u2019s just he wants to go to that party at the comic book store. A lot of the guys that hang out there are kind of creepy."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay that that\u2019s great.

Ready set go."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You know you just split an infinitive."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"There\u2019s no fooling you. Now what is this sacks statistic they put up there?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay um gosh how do I start? Um see Raj is kind of naive. I mean he hasn\u2019t dated a whole lot of women. And I\u2019m concerned that without meaning to you might be taking advantage of him. You know by letting him buy you a bunch of expensive things.And I.. I\u2026 Howard focus. Tell her what I\u2019m saying."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hello again."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I tried once. They do men\u2019s and women\u2019s hair in the same room at the same time. It\u2019s like Sodom and Gomorrah with mousse."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Full of eggs and only appealing for a short time."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I will."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I think we have to acknowledge those were some fairly savage pre-adolescent Jews."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Look normally I can just ignore you. I mean I get it you\u2019re a little peculiar. You know like Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Thank you. I appreciate that. You\u2019re good people Leonard. There\u2019s something I need to tell you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well to paraphrase Mozart all the subatomic particles are there I just have to put them in the right order."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No it\u2019s okay between "},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh there\u2019s so much I want to change."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I also love the enemies of America."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay this is not what I meant when I said go outside and play."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh sure."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Howard?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh my God.

She\u2019ll knock out those sideburns for free."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"How can one person be a whole movie?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Goodnight Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Dad you remember Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh no. Good game."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Ooh Thor! He\u2019s hot."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I have to. How can we ever hope to have a healthy relationship if I don\u2019t tell her how disappointed I am and that I\u2019ll never forgive her?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I think I know."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"There\u2019s a new sports bar over on Colorado Ave\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Is there anything you\u2019re both equally bad at?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019ll make the popcorn."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah you do that."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No. I do not accept this. Everything is changing and I hate it. It stops now. I\u2019m helping you get back on your feet. I would like to purchase this comic book please."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Dear Lord you\u2019re an astronomer. Although you may have earthly woes get your mind back on the stars.

I\u2019m on board."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Did Bernadette think it was cool?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Great because I\u2019ve been thinking if I really want this acting thing to work I need to focus all my energy on it. And to do that I should quit waitressing at The Cheesecake Factory."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey let\u2019s light a fire."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Come on come home with us and tomorrow I\u2019ll I\u2019ll take you to Legoland."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well now did you also have a dog? Because I found what appears to be a battery-operated chew toy."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well Mrs. Latham said she was seriously considering donating money so we could get a cryogenic centrifugal pump."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Why would I lose friends just because I started dating someone?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well what do you know? Here I was waiting to be bored with biology and instead you tickle my intellectual fancy. Which unlike my body is an okay place to tickle."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah. So how you doing?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well what a thrill."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I bought a parrot."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Quick what does a hawk sound like?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Excuse me.

So into her."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Five what?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No. I had a date with a proper education. Instead of a tuxedo I dressed myself in good habits. Instead of spiked punch I enjoyed the intoxicating flavour of knowledge. Instead of dancing in a gym I shook my bootyto the seductive rhythms\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Here buy this one. Look it\u2019s the one we\u2019re getting see happy guy available."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I object.

I just don\u2019t want to be a waitress for the rest of my life."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Just because I didn\u2019t express myself well doesn\u2019t mean my underlying point was invalid! You bloviating buffoon!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"My apologies. Good night Amy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah the correct animal for interspecies supersolider is koala. You would wind up with an army so cute it couldn\u2019t be attacked."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019m having my windows untinted."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Reconstituted Thai food."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"So um what surprised you the most when you first came to America?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Pretty cool huh?

Zack hi. You guys remember Zack."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay. Shall we? Oh my God. It\u2019s light it\u2019s flaky it\u2019s buttery.

Let\u2019s play Physics Fiesta."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What are you implying?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh it was kind of like a birthday party.

And you promised you wouldn\u2019t do that anymore!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I realized something. When Amy was in my life I was hyper-focused on my work and ignored her."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Are you sure?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I guess the experiment begins."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Why me of all people?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What are you talking about it\u2019s fine she bought it it\u2019s over."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Waugh romance ninja."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay so I pick good guys but turn them into losers."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"We\u2019ll switch.

We never got that."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh gets better."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re living here provisionally. But I must say it\u2019s looking good."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah I\u2019ve read about that they\u2019re sending research teams down into abandoned salt mines."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I guess I just miss when life was simpler."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I don\u2019t know. Um nuclear war. Accidentally being buried alive. Any of those movies where you get that phone call that says you\u2019re going to die and then you do."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Nothing to worry about. People meet people all the time and it isn\u2019t weird. I met Bon Jovi once which you\u2019d think might be weird. Turns out total sweetheart."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"So my visa\u2019s only good as long as I\u2019m employed at the university and when they find out I\u2019ve got squat they\u2019re going to cut me off. By the way when I say squat I mean diddly-squat. I wish I had squat."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I have to be honest with you Leonard I\u2019m truly worried."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I am. Yeah Penny pointed out that what I\u2019m going through is essentially a breakup. And according to Cosmopolitan magazine one of the most effective techniques for moving on is to get rid of all reminders of the relationship."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Can you say that and not make it sound like I\u2019m a cat who learned how to use the toilet?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"This is awesome. I love it!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Did Leonard tell you to say that?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And I am sure it\u2019s still more valuable than whatever\u2019s in here."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Look Leonard you have to know how much I care about you. It\u2019s just that I\u2019ve said the L word too soon before and it didn\u2019t work out very well."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"As usual you\u2019re all wrong. The bravest person in the Marvel Universe is the doctor who gives Wolverine his prostate exam."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh for heaven\u2019s sake. I did your laundry I pee-pee-proofed your belt buckles I I even sprained my wrist helping your mother lift her bosom."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Pretty good right?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah it depends on the privacy settings."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Why didn\u2019t you say anything?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well I assume she meant that the two of you together would constitute a couple that others might consider cute. An alternate and somewhat less likely interpretation is that you could manufacture one. As in oh look Leonard and Lesley made Mr and Mrs Goldfarb aren\u2019t they adorable."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Because I can never understand your side."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So how is she?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well that was a waste of time. I\u2019m such an idiot."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh I\u2019m outraged."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well why don\u2019t you make up your own ending?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I do tonight. It\u2019s scary over there."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Onion dip it\u2019s onion dip."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Aquaman? Oh this isn\u2019t a gag gift Stuart."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No! Would you please stop referencing that infernal book? For example this morning I was calculating the random motion of virtual particles in a vacuum when suddenly the particles morphed into an image of Amy\u2019s dandruff gently cascading down onto her pale slightly hunched shoulders.

Don\u2019t make me pull it out of you."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019m spoiled? Your baby has a cape that costs $300."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Come on. Looks don\u2019t matter to Sheldon. Because he only has eyes for you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"The interface is pretty simple. You put your horizontal X coordinate here vertical Y coordinate here. When you\u2019re happy with those you press this button."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh I don\u2019t think I could do that."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Please tell me how I can fix it."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Perhaps this will help. Here are some facts about yourselves in the future that might contain a clue."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh relax.

You guys are the best."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That covers anything from farting in bed to killing a homeless guy. Oh my God. You ran over a hobo."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Right. Good catch. Anyway so I\u2019m sorry to waste your time. And uh and good luck with your screenplay."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Me too."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"So I have an idea for a filk song.

Like one of my classic murder mystery dinner parties."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Not to me. The only other retraction I ever had to issue was when I was seven and I conceded that my brother was the greatest ninja in East Texas. But that was just a ploy to get my face out of his armpit."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Mm-hmm."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I do like that the ex-boyfriend\u2019s out of the picture."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I knew it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m getting three trains."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"She is.

Oh dear I have to tinkle again."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Of course not."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh man that is so us."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey. Listen to this. Murder cannibalism and satanic rituals are just a few of the thousand plus horrors that await."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":" Penny."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh stop it. I assume this medical centre\u2019s already treated the burns on your bottom from the recent pants fire."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Bernadette that\u2019s great. Howard do you make a buttload?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Howard Raj. Judas."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No. No after everything you didn\u2019t do for me tonight I want you to have it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Under normal circumstances I\u2019d say I told you so. But as I have told you so with such vehemence and frequency already the phrase has lost all meaning. Therefore I will be replacing it with the phrase I informed you thusly."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"That is the worst isn\u2019t it?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh you\u2019re right. That is so embarrassing."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well Mom I\u2019m sorry but\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Damn you walletnook.com."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Exactly. Thank you. Do me a favour tell Koothrappali that next time you see him."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What\u2019s the protocol for leaving?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Still making sure the telescope\u2019s camera is white-field balanced."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh what the hell. Ooh!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Until you have kids."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No no it\u2019s not like that. It\u2019s uh I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like. But there is something I should prepare you for."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay sweetie we\u2019re on the clock here. Can you hate yourself and frost at the same time?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"The the element never existed. I didn\u2019t take it away science took it away. Be mad at science."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well you sit back relax and enjoy a beloved childhood memory. You see that cabin there? I read they were illegally squatting on Indian land. Yeah. Personally I think what we did to the Native Americans was wrong but this is your favourite show not mine. Oh look at little Laura Ingalls eating that peanut butter sandwich. Peanut butter? Huh? That\u2019s strange since peanut butter wasn\u2019t introduced until the early 1900s. If I knew this show was about time travel I would have watched it much sooner."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Then don\u2019t do it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay well I\u2019d offer you Halloween candy but that\u2019s gone. So what\u2019s up?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Are you Stan Lee?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay I know you don\u2019t have a lot of experience with women but Ramona seems to have a romantic interest in you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay let\u2019s go."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Me too."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I couldn\u2019t sleep because I kept thinking about what happened earlier between us. Also I had one heck of a bus nap. Oh speaking of which do you want some mutton and coconut milk?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"The bigger question is what are you gonna eat with that spoon? You didn\u2019t get any food."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I wouldn\u2019t be so sure about that."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You know I don\u2019t drink."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon you\u2019re a grown man he\u2019s a professional and your haircut is number three on that poster from 1946.

And now I owe you one."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Thank you. So do you."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh you don\u2019t want that."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"We\u2019re not living together."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay listen I may not have been entirely faithful but you you are not easy to lift."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Let\u2019s just play."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I appreciate the offer but if things don\u2019t work out with you two I\u2019m swooping in on her like a vulture."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Figure out the magic trick yet?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No of course not. That would be odd and suspicious behavior."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"And you\u2019re afraid you\u2019re gonna do something like your dad did?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Daddy he had nothing to do\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Because I know she hit on you and I know you liked it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah that\u2019s a real pickle. Bye."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Fine. Preliminary trial of the infinite persistence gyroscopic navigational system phase one commencing."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay well that\u2019s a problem."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Now get out of my spot."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You could power down."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"The what?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You could try calling Triple-A but based on NASA\u2019s latest timetable they won\u2019t get there for 35 years."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"The living room appears to be empty."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Sheldon it\u2019s your play. Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So business in the front science in the back."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Interesting."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh as small as Leonard is I don\u2019t think the two of you\u2019d be comfortable on the couch."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh do you uh want to do that again?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I know but you guys make being a crappy friend look fun."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I made a play for her and she shot me down."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Wait isn\u2019t she the grad student that used to follow him around?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"More?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh right. That."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh Howard it\u2019s still our thing. Come with us we\u2019ll we\u2019ll get you a scalped ticket."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh it\u2019s no problem. Is everything okay?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Sorry badgering me won\u2019t work. What you should have said is It\u2019s pointless to keep this a secret because Penny will tell us."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay now the PS4 is more angular and sleek-looking."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Where are my clothes?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah it\u2019s just things are good right now."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Unlikely. Here what about this one for my nephew?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I cannot believe they\u2019re letting her just use them like that. I mean anything she wants they go panting after her like trained dogs. You know that just last week she had Howard drive all the way to her uncle\u2019s house in Orange County to pick up her TV?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yeah well I wouldn\u2019t get too close. If I give the right command in German she\u2019ll rip your face off."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Howard listen\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Let me guess you think the whole idea is lame?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hello?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"That\u2019s fine. She and I can cry together."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Come on you enjoyed the movie. I saw you tearing up when the village got flooded and everyone had to relocate."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Emily listen I\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t come by."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"When can I sit with you again?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay that\u2019s my life that\u2019s my friends good to see you say goodbye."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Excuse me Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"They\u2026. might all be there. Or a subset of them might be there uh algebraically speaking there are too many unknowns for example Sheldon had Quizznos for lunch sometimes he finds that filling other times he doesn\u2019t it\u2019s no fault of Quizznos they have a varied menu."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"It\u2019ll give you confidence. You know sometimes when I\u2019m feeling all stressed out about something I go out and buy a cute top or a fun skirt and I have a whole new outlook on life."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Kite fighting?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It runs on syphilis?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Since my preschool got a bunny."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"How can reading my journal be an accident?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Anyways I wanted you guys all to know that I\u2019ve been taking a really hard look at things and come to the conclusion I have to stop kidding myself. I suck at acting. It\u2019s time for me to move back to Nebraska."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yes he is. With his dorky T-shirt and his little hipster glasses."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Buy him the robot Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well that\u2019s easy. Anyone can go online and get ordained as a minister. I know a piercing parlour where for a hundred bucks they\u2019ll marry you and stick a wedding ring through any body part you want."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"All right."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No it\u2019s not\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"And I thought me having sex with Emily was gonna be the big news."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay thanks for your time."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Definitely."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What the hell agreed."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Sim City.

Well see ya."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon be nice."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"She\u2019s like my fourth favourite catwoman."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What are you doing?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Based on this pep talk I\u2019d say you\u2019re still doing it."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well that doesn\u2019t seem fair."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Thank you. I appreciate that."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m confused. I thought you were involved in some sort of socially intimate pairing with Leslie Winkle."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Are you sure?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Alright. But I\u2019m watching you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I know it\u2019s high-resolution sadness."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh I\u2019ll get that."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What\u2019s Gunning with God? I\u2019m afraid to ask."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019d like your honest opinion on something."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hippos are the deadliest creature. A half-human half-hippo soldier would be pretty badass."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Over what?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Perfect timing. Food\u2019s ready."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"We just got back from that exhibit of those plasticised human cadavers."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Thanks."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t know how I feel about this."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I feel like I\u2019m being strangled by a boa constrictor. Why\u2019d you stop?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Absolutely not. Look we\u2019re just gonna have dinner and you know see how it goes."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Howard if I may interject here with a piece of friendly advice. Is working on magic tricks really how you want to spend your time? Granted you\u2019re just an engineer but that doesn\u2019t mean you might not someday build a geegaw or a thingamabob that may get you a thank you in someone else\u2019s Nobel prize acceptance speech."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Fine. What do you want?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s not just Cylons. Superman\u2019s next."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I know. And it gets worse. Her efforts are causing me to have affectionate feelings for her at inappropriate times."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No we\u2019re not. Let\u2019s say for a moment that I accept the bath item gift hypothesis I now lay the following conundrum at your feet which size?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Are you single?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m not going to apologise I didn\u2019t say anything that wasn\u2019t true."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Yeah I saw something for Halley and I couldn\u2019t resist."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"He chased a squirrel around the quad for a while and then threw up in my car."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I do."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Wow it\u2019s all happening so fast. Should we just sleep on it?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Then I\u2019ve been up all night."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I agree. I move our relationship terminate immediately."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Forty-five."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It is an inefficient design for example Penny has a flat screen TV which means all the space behind it is wasted."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s not that simple. What am I supposed to say? Penny do you have any friends you\u2019d like to never hear from again?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Wow Zork. Well you guys have fun."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Penny. Didn\u2019t you recently state that you and I are friends?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Not knowing is part of the fun.

How\u2019d it go?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Does it? A happy accident."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"My father used to borrow it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah but there was ample parking."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Then he and I are on equal ground."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So um what are you gonna do? Do you want me to talk to Leonard let him down easy?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"My sister told me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Gentlemen a little less bellyaching. We\u2019re Starfleet officers and a member of the Borg Collective."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yes it\u2019s very nice goodnight Raj."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hmm yes. Yeah perhaps I\u2019ve been harder on them than they deserve."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"No I kind of feel like being alone right now."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"All right well what happens if you imagine him naked?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Wow where did you learn these moves?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019m the astrophysicist. Astro means space."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh hey Bernadette the swing comes with two different mobiles. The giraffes are pretty cute what do you think?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh that is so sad."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Why would you do that? You\u2019re a string theorist as well."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So sleep with the new girl and lie to Priya."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Excuse me?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"The dog\u2026 koira. The roof\u2026 katto. Grapes\u2026 ryp leet.  One minute.

It feels racist."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Are you kidding? Yes. What did you have in mind?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Is that the place on the hill with the weird priests in front of it?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s preposterous."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah why?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s not. I\u2019ll have you know in the field of physics we work with particles so small they make fat jokes about the locus coeruleus i.e. when your locus coeruleus sits around the house it sits around the house."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Look Sheldon before you race off to the fertility clinic you might want to think about uh gee I don\u2019t know maybe actually spending some time with her."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Boy I\u2019m glad we\u2019re going out again."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Aw."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay listen to me.

She doesn\u2019t get along with Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"We\u2019re actually scanning equations and getting good results."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well who\u2019d you go with?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"We\u2019re doing good. I think Sheldon has something he would like to say to Amy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well that really hurt."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hit it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"My room of course."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I couldn\u2019t sleep."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well not just him.

I went to your boring thing last month."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That\u2019ll be four seventy-five."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Really?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Then how?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I\u2019m sorry."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Bite me. Sheldon how could you just sit there and let them spy on me?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No I was thinking how come they get to leave and I can\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Amy after consideration I believe we may have acted rashly. I propose we resume our relationship and attempt to resolve our differences."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Can\u2019t listen zone. Also don\u2019t care."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh really? When I was doing string theory and hit a dead end why didn\u2019t you try to help me?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Since always."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thanks sorry to bother you. But I said it like a badass."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"The the gas station across the street."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"The Web site\u2019s frozen. I can\u2019t get in."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh no not just a season. If I\u2019m in I\u2019m in for the whole run even if the quality declines."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I\u2019m sure you guys will figure something out."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Look. We keep procrastinating. We saw Back to the Future II pigeons playing ping-pong a bunch of countries that look like genitals and one guy whose genitals look like Denmark."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well the cleaning lady was there but she doesn\u2019t like me. You need any help?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You got it buddy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"This is for you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Schnapps."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well it was fun.

So get this her replacement is a woman named Sandy whose husband\u2019s name is Kim."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Are you here alone?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I know it\u2019s basic culinary science."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No a time machine from Sophie\u2019s Choice."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I don\u2019t know I\u2019m torn. I want to know where he\u2019s going but now I kind of want to play with the bunny."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I don\u2019t know.

And in a different way than it was twenty minutes ago."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Fine I\u2019ll take it back."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I totally had one of those."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Raj what are you doing?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh. Did you know at the United Nations there\u2019s a Department for Outer Space Affairs?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Not only is it signed to me but this is where he wiped his mouth. So we are currently in the presence of Leonard Nimoy\u2019s DNA."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m so proud of you! You sold yourself out like a common streetwalker!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Interesting."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh my God what happened?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Actually in this case I think she was."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Fine just try not to look too alive."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I said ta-da. Show\u2019s over."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It must be hell inside your head."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Aw there\u2019s a thing."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Uh-huh he called me Slugger until I got my first training bra and then he just stopped playing catch with me. I wasn\u2019t Slugger anymore. Your mother\u2019s here!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m not gonna schmooze anybody. I\u2019m gonna let my work speak for itself."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh come on it\u2019s fine. We\u2019ll just put it all on the table you know family style."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh no."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You dream different than me."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You\u2019re kidding."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No. No no no. You know what? The toilet\u2019s been doing that. I called the building manager so\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hi."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh what the hell. I\u2019m supposed to go see that girl from the comic book store Alice but I don\u2019t know if I should because I\u2019m going out with Priya but she\u2019s in India."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I see. Is that all right? I\u2019m sorry but this is a litigious society. I\u2019m gonna need verbal consent."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh sure."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s Thursday. Listen Penny."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":" Human Resources Department."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Come on dude we\u2019ve been friends for years."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey can I stay here tonight?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Science. You wouldn\u2019t understand."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Or fornication. Yeah. But that has judgmental overtones so I\u2019ll hold that in reserve."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well anyway I\u2019ll leave you to your girls\u2019 night."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Look on the bright side. As the result of Penny\u2019s forfeit you have become the world\u2019s first winner of Research Lab. Would you like a commemorative snow cone?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well it\u2019s a table right? I mean why can\u2019t there be food on it?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Really? Well that\u2019s great."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No we just had a little spat."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I have no choice."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"He\u2019s right Penny. It\u2019s all there."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay. But you using Sheldon to do your dirty work is like when Cersei used the King\u2019s Guard to do her bidding."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"We\u2019re just gonna have to make the best of this."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"That\u2019ll do it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That sounds like sarcasm but I\u2019m going to disregard it because I have an agenda. Paintball. Specifically the interdepartmental tournament this weekend. Now in order to function better as a fighting unit I thought we should establish a chain of command. Now it goes without saying that I would outrank the three of you but the question remains by how much? Now I don\u2019t see me as some four-star general back at HQ riding a desk and playing golf with the Secretary of Defence. But I also can\u2019t be Sergeant Cooper because that might lead you to think of me as just a regular Joe. This might take some thought. As you were."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Thanks for seeing me on such short notice."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Just a sec. Oh who says just a sec? I hate myself. Hello."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All I know is you can only fit one of her in a car. And there\u2019s the clown that came out of her. I really didn\u2019t want to come here but this is shaping up to be one of the best Thanksgivings I\u2019ve had in a long time."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"There\u2019s nothing to worry about. Your secret\u2019s safe with me."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"And the other half licking my face. That\u2019s why I\u2019m brushing her teeth."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh that\u2019s nice. But relax sometimes change is good. Uh you were worried about Zachary Quinto being the new Spock but you wound up liking him."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Let me put this in a way you\u2019ll understand Penny. You remember how you explained to me that the Kardashians aren\u2019t real celebrities? Well geology is the Kardashians of science."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh let me just get one thing. It\u2019s my backup emergency supply kit. The living room escape route doesn\u2019t pass through here. Now good night. And if there\u2019s an apocalypse good luck."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What are you doing?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Nice. You mean like at parks and schools?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sorry but I don\u2019t think I need your permission to have my father at my wedding."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m sorry Leonard. But revenge is a dish best served cold."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Life? What life? Look at me I\u2019m a monster. And now I have blood on my hands or paws. I don\u2019t know."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well excuse me I don\u2019t think Penny\u2019s out of line at all. You don\u2019t own her. It\u2019s like my girl Beyonce says if you like it you shoulda put a ring on it.\u201d"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"That\u2019s Howard\u2019s cousin that he had sex with."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon what are the words I can say right now to end this conversation and let me go back to sleep?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And turn the bedroom floor into an amniotic Slip \u2018n Slide."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":" You got to stop beating yourself up over this. I mean you made a mistake but it was a happy mistake."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Is Ernest Goes to Jail the only prison movie you\u2019ve seen?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"How did we get in the car?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Chicken?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well it almost happened when you called my apple pie crust doughy but the truth is you were right and I was just angry at myself."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh. It\u2019s it\u2019s not what it looks like."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay as soon as she gets here so she knows I\u2019m cool with it I\u2019m going to make a joke about her being deaf. I was thinking hey did you hear the one about\u2026? Oh no I bet you didn\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"See? Miserable."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Don\u2019t look up there\u2019s cameras."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Guess who the university is sending to Switzerland to attend a conference and see the CERN supercollider on February 14?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And actually it was three different men."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Come on a medium-sized asteroid is still an interesting discovery."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Is it me or was that Sheldon\u2019s way of saying Vegas baby!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh I\u2019m I\u2019m sorry. I assumed that you wanted candid truth-telling from your employees but I realize now you want the mindless nattering of complacent yes-men."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Again?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I do."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I think the Reverend Hofstadter is making an ironic connection between your statement about love and your rejection of his proposal in the bedroom."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No you\u2019re not let\u2019s go."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You\u2019re wrong."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah yeah yeah. You go ahead. I\u2019ll catch up with you."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh I\u2019m having the nicest time. You guys are like family to me. You know that right?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Uh yeah it sounds fun but no thanks.  Have a good night!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Why don\u2019t you just give me five minutes? I\u2019ll Google how to do this. I\u2019ll call you right back."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What\u2019s it thinking about now?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well did you try wearing the shirt I said was inappropriate for work?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Unbelievable. Okay uh I don\u2019t know what he told you but you can\u2019t stay here."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey Leonard if you\u2019re not busy tomorrow I have to do a little reception after work."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh that\u2019s a big deal."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well just don\u2019t get anything Jurassic. He feels like that whole chunk of time has gone Hollywood. Hey uh you know he told a sad story about how his sister tricked him into thinking Batman was coming to his party."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sure. If he wants to spend a couple of years doing her homework while she drinks herself into a stupor with non-fat White Russians while you\u2019re the one holding her head out of the toilet while she\u2019s puking and telling you she wishes more guys were like you and they she gets into Cornell because you wrote her essay for her and you drive up to visit her one weekend and she acts like she doesn\u2019t even know you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh I\u2019ll get it. Go sports."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh well I had a wonderful childhood."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Ugh what?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well I wouldn\u2019t put it exactly that way."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Excuse me but isn\u2019t hosting guests an aspect of Menushya Yajna one of the five central religious duties or sacrifices of the Hindu householder?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"We did it! I said we."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Sheldon they don\u2019t have ice cream."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And I appreciate the pretence."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"How could you get lost?

Now Introduction to Physics. What is physics? Physics comes from the ancient Greek word physika. It\u2019s at this point that you\u2019ll want to start taking notes. Physika means the science of natural things. And it is there in ancient Greece that our story begins."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well you\u2019re all thinking it I\u2019m the only one who hasn\u2019t done anything worthwhile."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay wait\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh thank you Mother."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What could I possibly have done to offend Mrs. Vartabedian?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I\u2019ve never been to a funeral before."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What do you have\u2026."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Of course."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay.

Have you ever seen a movie with Stuart before?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hmm."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay well I\u2019m just trying to help you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"So if you don\u2019t mind me asking do you think you might start dating again?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No Leonard this is your last chance. One day a historian is going to come to you and say is it true you were friends with Dr. Sheldon Cooper? And you\u2019re going to have to choke back a hot sob of regret and humiliation as you mumble I was but I chose to go to a party thrown by the one kid from Stand By Me that no one remembers."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh dear Lord. Two years ago we didn\u2019t even know each other and now I\u2019m in your apartment after dark. How much faster can this thing go?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Did you stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What is wrong with people?

Okay listen. If you\u2019re imagining that it was sexy it wasn\u2019t. We we were both drunk and she smelled like an ashtray. The boat was moving a lot so I chipped her tooth."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"TV star."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"And also for breaking the head off the ice swan so I could hold it against my pulled groin."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay um how about Crash\u201d? Howard \u201cCrash\u201d Wolowitz."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I really think we should examine the chain of causality here."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well I\u2019ve been on a little trip myself recently. Not to Sin City but to Sincere City. Where instead of genital warts the only growth you\u2019ll come back with is personal growth."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay look you just caught me by surprise last night. I didn\u2019t know what to say."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey. So where are they?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh Leonard you shouldn\u2019t have. Oh boy! What is it?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Huh well I think there\u2019s some really innovative stuff going on in dark matter."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Cruel as that may be that is not in itself a credential."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I can\u2019t compete with that. Bye."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh what did I do?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh yeah no worries."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"A cap and gown?

I\u2019ll make the popcorn."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Sheldon says impossible. Howard and I say not only possible but as a mode of transportation way cooler than a Batmobile."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh my God that\u2019s where I know you from."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"\u2013 Priya can I come in?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Your what?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well not really."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Fine.

Howard tell them."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Look I\u2019m just saying um Penny is one of our many neighbours you know and in our building neighbours come and go it\u2019s very casual no dress code. In fact some mornings I\u2019ll just mosey down to the third floor in my pyjamas and have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Nice try. It only recognizes my voice."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Huh?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"But technically yes."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You know frankly I\u2019d prefer a sex tape."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Can you guarantee that it won\u2019t happen at any time during the night?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sure I\u2019m still figuring out the thermo-acoustic expander."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay.

Too much?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah there\u2019s room in the bed by Sheldon\u2019s feet."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Of course it is."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"He\u2019s right. But in my defence if we could survive that we could survive anything."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Our clothes our wallets phones."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey Raj do you want to go with me tomorrow?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Me too. Oh look we\u2019ve got enough ketchup to cover every ounce of it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re right. That is more menial. Hello I\u2019m Sheldon. I\u2019ll be your server today. I don\u2019t recommend the salmon. I saw it in the kitchen."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That\u2019s alright my tail\u2019s prehensile I\u2019ll swat him off."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well type two diabetes runs in my family.

It\u2019s probably lonely."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hey how about we stay the night and hit Legoland in the morning?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Howard Hughes saved his urine in milk bottles."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"She\u2019s right. I\u2019m too hot."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You saw her. She looks like Jim Carrey from Dumb and Dumber."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s right. It\u2019s called foreplay. And I could make the case that you two aren\u2019t moving forward in your relationship."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"We\u2019re here to see Koothrappali not kill Batman."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Amy good luck getting these guys excited about a dinner with a theme. I gave up when no one cared about my Tom Hanks-giving."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh and did they have kids?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Sorry. I\u2019m a little distracted. I can\u2019t seem to get in touch with Amy. I tried e-mail video chat tweeting her posting on her Facebook wall texting her nothing."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Maybe slapped with a fine."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Jimmy I\u2019m kind of curious why you wanted to see me."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019ve been thinking about it and you might be right. But the good news is that I\u2019m pretty sure I know why."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Ew."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Technically that would be coitus interruptus."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh good Stuart I thought I heard your voice. Do you have a moment?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Maybe you should find someone to help you get your finances under control."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You know the pale blue of Luke Skywalker\u2019s lightsaber before it was digitally remastered?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh I\u2019m back to trains. Woo-woo."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That is good news. Bye."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes but tell me a dinosaur chicken salad sandwich wouldn\u2019t hit the Mesozoic spot."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes of course that\u2019s why it\u2019s tight."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Let me see.

Otherwise you\u2019re cruelly tempting them with a glimpse of a world that\u2019s just beyond their soot-stained fingertips."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019d write that down but I can\u2019t now can I?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s over for me. I\u2019m done with women. Like when I swore off Pop Rocks. They both hurt you on purpose."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Isn\u2019t it?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Then what was oh boy?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh they\u2019re all up there huh?

It does it perfectly."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And it\u2019s just the way you like it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"When did this happen?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard the Transformers teach us that things are not always what they appear to be. You know like uh a semi truck might be an alien robot or uh someone in a romantic relationship uh might feel differently than they appear to. Or a conversation about The Transformers might actually be about someone in this room. I\u2019m going to pause to let that sink in."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You say one thing and do the other so then you are driving me and you find me a delight."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No no. No it\u2019s too late. I\u2019m your bran muffin.

Why am I the last to know?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It\u2019s true but on the other hand you are wearing a bird sweater."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah. Yeah. No no. Um. So it\u2019s getting pretty late. We should probably go to sleep."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Secondly I can\u2019t think of a more horrible idea than Penny meeting Mandy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You can\u2019t do that. Not only is it a violation of California state law it flies directly in the face of Cheesecake Factory policy."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah my friend from Omaha plays the guitar. Anyway he\u2019s coming to L.A. looking for some session work so I told him he could just crash on my couch for a few weeks."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"My goodness do you remember comes with apsparagus?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You appear to have put your car key in the door lock are you aware of that?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019ve been doing some research online and apparently female primates you know uh apes chimpanzees you they find their mate more desirable when he\u2019s being courted by another female. Now this effect is intensified when the rival female is secreting the pheromones associated with ovulation. Which brings me back to my question where are you in . Clearly I\u2019m 14 days too early."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well played. Sometimes I don\u2019t give you enough credit Penny."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Anyway as I was saying Sheldon probably just needs a little alone time. \u2018Cause that\u2019s important. Not just for him but for most anybody really."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah it\u2019s nothing to cry about."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It is. If you like wandering around a big empty house with no one to love you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It was like the rest of the class wanted Ms. McDonald to forget the quiz."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Huh? Cos it looks a lot like breakfast."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019ll take my chances."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"We should let you guys talk."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You kept walking. I think you did."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You\u2019re making me sound like a caveman."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Are you still going to tell him about you-know-who?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Thank you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well perhaps we should hold up a sign that assures passing motorists of our mental competence."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Let me ask you a question when did you guys start feeling grown up? \u2018Cause I am not sure I do."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay he is not dying."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Not necessarily. I\u2019m often surprised by my lack of familiarity with Leonard. Just the other day I discovered he not only has a loofah he hides it. Why do you suppose a man would be ashamed of having a loofah? I myself prefer to have my excess epithelial cells slough off naturally but I don\u2019t condemn those who seek to accelerate the process.  "},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Fine. Bad."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"That\u2019s enough."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh I don\u2019t know uh weather uh fish you could do carpentry with why Leonard is such an attractive and desirable boyfriend. Yeah pick one your choice."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh Penny? Penny?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Fine. Go ahead."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay so it\u2019s not a legal ceremony it\u2019s just a chance for us to redo our vows so everyone can be part of it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"\u2018Cause I do that I do overreact. Maybe I should call Mike and apologise."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yes. Please find someone who cares."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Man I\u2019m worn out."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Ah really? Thank you. Fate has given me a rare second chance and I swear to Vishnu I\u2019m not gonna blow it. Or normal words followed by a charming smile."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Calm down. We\u2019ll figure it out."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Me? I\u2019ll give you a hint. Neeeeooooowwwww!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"There\u2019s that prostate doctor but I\u2019m still mad at her. Oh there\u2019s a woman. I\u2019ll make her my girlfriend."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"As evidenced by your boyfriend and his fear of hamsters."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Uh Origin of Species."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon you have to let somebody else answer."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No. It upsets Sheldon when she willy-nilly takes it from the containers without regard for its equitable distribution. This is essentially why you have famine in India."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh. I say a lot of things sweetie. So how about it Sheldon?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Welcome to another classic Koothrappali murder mystery dinner."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t know how do carbon atoms form a benzene ring? Proximity and valence electrons."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I do appreciate that."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I work at the Cheesecake Factory I said bye."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That\u2019s three minutes.

Remember that when I take my shirt off."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Fine tell us you\u2019re going to have sex with Penny."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah sure."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What\u2019s going on?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I don\u2019t think it matters. Look Sheldon I believe when the time is right for you to meet someone it\u2019ll just happen. Okay? Not because of a test or a Web site but because\u2026  we are the dreamers of dreams."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hold on hold on."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"No if we got Captain Reynolds from Firefly to do a signing at Stuart\u2019s store that would be amazing."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon I didn\u2019t mean it like that."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So you\u2019ll go to the Doctor Who convention with me next week?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well here\u2019s your key back."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay you know what? Maybe I\u2019ll take Amy with me to the spa this weekend instead."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Penny is not the reason I didn\u2019t pursue that idea."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Let me give you an example. Earlier today I decoded the headers on your e-mail and I know that your name is Kenneth Fitzgerald. From that I figured out where you live and where you work. Now to make this a Mexican standoff I would say something like uh you give us the helium or I\u2019ll turn you in to the authorities."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"And you talked?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Aw the pet store?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Dr. Sheldon Cooper theoretical physicist Caltech."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What do you think Sheldon? Want an action figure that looks just like you?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Here we go."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I present to you the relationship agreement. A binding covenant that in its 31 pages enumerates iterates and codifies the rights and responsibilities of Sheldon Lee Cooper here and after known as the boyfriend and Amy Farrah Fowler here and after known as the girlfriend."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well where are we going?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right. I officially reinstate Anything Can Happen Thursday."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well uh it looked pretty good in the store."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh I know what he\u2019s saying and he\u2019s not he\u2019s not funny."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You know I kind of feel bad about what we did to him. "},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Interesting."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Aren\u2019t you gonna ask?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"The worst part was watching her carve that turkey."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"All right. Uh would would it be okay for me to see her? We\u2019re usually in bed by now and I want her to know that I\u2019m here. Yes we sleep together and sometimes we spoon."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Let\u2019s leave Leonard out of this for the moment. This is about you and me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It pains me to say it but I think some form of penalty is in order so as to discourage this type of behaviour in the future."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I did it. Had to go to three clothing stores but we finally found a dress that could envelop your mother."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Next year I\u2019m going to Epcot."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Sheldon is there a place on this train to get alcohol?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You know I kind of feel bad about what we did to him.

Reminds me of my parents\u2019 house back in New Delhi."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":" Amy. Bye."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Now who would do that?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Was he the one who wedgied you so hard your testicle reascended and you spent your whole Christmas break waiting for it to come back down?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"All right guys what game do you want to play?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Bad idea."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m the Flash.

And I was positive you never would."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I did the research. Tony the Tiger Dig\u2019em the Frog Cap\u2019n Crunch Toucan Sam Count Chocula Trix the Rabbit Snap Crackle and Pop. Not one cereal mascot is a girl. It\u2019s a total breakfast sausage fest."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"There was a tall man from Cornwall whose length exceeded his bed. My body fits on it but barely upon it there\u2019s no room for my big Cornish head."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay. And when would that be?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I was beating him so bad he doesn\u2019t want to be friends anymore. Why does everyone love me except Stephen Hawking?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Notify the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary the word plenty has been redefined to mean two."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Um I\u2019m not sure but I think the right answer here is no."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Thank you. It wasn\u2019t easy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Great. New topic.

I didn\u2019t mean to upset you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah and when I dropped her off at the hotel she even gave me a hug."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well I\u2019m not sure about interesting but\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Chosen by science?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Three hundred and I\u2019ll throw in my original 1979 Mattel Millenium Falcon with real light speed sound effects."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Wow."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah I\u2019m also doing it for Leonard.

Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle but beyond that I have realised that the Leo I described would not have agreed to go to rehab."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh-uh."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"jlyajbe\u2019. DaH nep\u2019a\u2019 Penny?

It worked for my parents."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"If I were to give you this gift basket based on that action alone and no other data infer and describe the hypothetical relationship that exists between us."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hardly. Consider this unlikely but very plausible scenario. A young woman alone in the big city. Her ridiculous dream of becoming an actress lies shattered about her."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay now what I\u2019m hearing is that you feel that I sometimes take too long to express myself and you wish I\u2019d be more succinct."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So I guess it\u2019s a good thing we stopped for dinner."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I agree. That is if you\u2019ve never been to or heard of a party before."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Thank you. . Shall I count down from three?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Is that better?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Or it turned into mustard Kryptonite the only way to destroy a rogue Kryptonian hotdog threatening Earth."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh it\u2019s okay. I have no morals and I\u2019m desperately lonely. I\u2019ll be the other man if you want a little something-something on the side."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Is someone sick?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Made necessary by her insistence on going into my room."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What do you have eyes in the back of your head?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh hey.

You know get the word of mouth going."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I just want you guys to know I am really grateful for your help and for every dollar I make I\u2019m going to give you 20 cents."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I intend to write that soap company a strongly worded letter."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I drank milk that tasted funny."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I don\u2019t know empathy? Anyway I\u2019m just saying that you\u2019re feeling upset about something with Howard and I\u2019m upset about something with Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"And I just want you to know I\u2019m happy to look in on Bernadette while you\u2019re gone."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Absolutely. If you admit that you\u2019re a 30-year-old man who\u2019s incapable of functioning on his own."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Let me see let me see. One calls it insightful and innovative. We\u2019re insightful and innovative."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"By that reasoning we should also play bridge hold up a chuppah and enter the Olympic bobsled competition."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Dr. Rostenkowski it may interest you to know that saying pew pew pew isn\u2019t as effective as pressing your blaster key. In the same way that saying whee doesn\u2019t make the land speeder go."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh that kid. Poor Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"How did that work out?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well can I say she looks nice?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Come on I just told you I had a girlfriend.

"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"We\u2019re pinned down."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Now now there\u2019s no need to make this emotional."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What? He paid off her credit cards? Damn it I could\u2019ve dated Raj for a couple months. But I I wouldn\u2019t have because I\u2019m not that kind of girl. We should really talk to Raj."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"She\u2019s here she\u2019s here. How do I look? Do I look smart?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well I texted you but you didn\u2019t respond. Leonard and Penny were arguing."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well the contents are irrelevant. A legal bailment has been created. Does that mean nothing to you?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Cohabitation with my girlfriend? That\u2019s a great deal to process."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Insurance is gonna buy you a new car. It\u2019s not gonna de-funk my junk."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh I have a feeling that once you start you\u2019re not gonna want to or be allowed to stop."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced not shredded?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You can do it."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019m telling you dude the only way to feel better about Penny going out with other guys is for you to get back on the whores."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh well \u2019cause you know we\u2019re gonna do bad."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"This is the difference between eating and dining."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well I was thinking put your head out the window like a dog but that\u2019ll work. Please? This\u2019ll be quick. Leonard? As soon as we get home I want to have coitus with Amy. Okay she can\u2019t hear. The reason I called you is because I didn\u2019t want Amy to know I couldn\u2019t make it on my own."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Genius. I was gonna say why does anyone think Sheldon\u2019s a genius? But I didn\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t want beef jerky."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Your girlfriend and your ex-girlfriend are hanging out together? Oh yeah that can only be good for you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah that\u2019ll hold me for a while."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Maybe the fact that you went and had a baby."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Wow.

I think it was around the time he tried to declare our apartment a sovereign nation. I still have some of the currency."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I heard a noise."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay is everyone clear on the plan?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Really?

Great. How do you want to start?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Damn it. What do you want me to do"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I can\u2019t comment without violating our agreement that I don\u2019t criticize your work."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"A medium-sized asteroid."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"May I borrow your water?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m telling you try the hanger."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Raj now I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re suffering.

It\u2019s unpleasant and needs to be repeated. This suggests some sort of invasive medical test like perhaps a colonoscopy."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So what\u2019s your news Bernadette?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"How\u2019d you do that?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No no no  no I don\u2019t think that\u2019s where it was."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay um hey God.

One more time. Yeah it\u2019s it\u2019s a little blurry but I think that works in your favour. Do you want a beer?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You donate eggs. We will place them in cryogenic storage. I will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs have them fertilized and implanted in you that way everybody wins."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It wouldn\u2019t kill you to pick up the phone."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No! It wasn\u2019t a betrayal. It was more of a can\u2019t afford any more points on my license.

Do you happen to recollect if I left a notebook in these here parts?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I am meeting you halfway I\u2019m willing to concede that you\u2019ve done some stupid things."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Absolutely not."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019m Raj by the way. This is Howard."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well I\u2019m not much of a sports fan but thank you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well it\u2019s scary for me too."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey it\u2019s still early. Why don\u2019t we go back and have that party?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That\u2019s it that\u2019s the line."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"And instead of standing around watching you can help us build your smaller guidance system."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Listen don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll talk to him."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Look at that. I got a date with Penny. I can\u2019t believe it took you a whole year."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Very well. You leave me no choice."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah let\u2019s try it again and maybe this time you could work on your body language a bit. You know when you\u2019re all hunched like that you\u2019re shutting the audience out but when you\u2019re relaxed and open you\u2019re inviting them in."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"A Halloween party?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m not a child don\u2019t do that."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Really why?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"We get it you won the game. Stop bragging."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh what\u2019d you get?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"From Amy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well you see while Leo would not have gone into rehab it is completely plausible that we would have talked him into leaving the motel and coming home with us."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Will you please turn your shirt off?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Non-alcoholic bee-ee-eeuh "},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Run Monte run!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh alright. Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"How does one sort of\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh come on. Sheldon have you ever once heard me say that I don\u2019t trust Penny? Sheldon? Where did he go?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Great. You have a girlfriend Howard\u2019s got a girlfriend Sheldon\u2019s got a girl\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"From there it was easy to find him on Instagram Snapchat and pretty much track his every movement."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon has kind of a photographic memory."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"The new Star Wars movie."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No I went to punch the water fountain slipped in water in front of the water fountain and hit my head on the water fountain."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"At the hands of those teenagers."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I\u2019m sorry?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right I\u2019ll start with an easy one um Isaac Newton Madame Curie and Niels Bohr."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Cholermus. It\u2019s a traditional Swiss breakfast dish. I\u2019m preparing my gastrointestinal system for the exotic cuisine of Switzerland."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Get into what? Why wouldn\u2019t you love the chilli cheese fries? They\u2019ve been in your life a long time. They make you happy. They deserve to know."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Damn straight almost 1am. And we weren\u2019t even watching TV. We were watching Netflix like the kids do."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Maybe I could do it."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I\u2019ll try it. Like this?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Thank you. I thought it was inspired."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh Sheldon can\u2019t you do that yourself?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh baguettes. Yes I like baguettes. What exactly are you doing?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"They\u2019re not saying that."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey guys. What you doing? Going out to discover electricity?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You mean like when a guy\u2019s upset because his friend agreed to take a cooking class with him and then doesn\u2019t show up because he\u2019s doing a juice fast with his mother?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well you doled out affection as a reward for achievement a proven way to raise a child. Or train a rat."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I may not be liking this game so much."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon this date is probably my one chance with Penny what happens if I blow it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh Raj look at you!"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sheldon congratulations. Brought you cheesecake from work. You know \u2019cause of your award not because a busboy sneezed on it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m surprised to see you here."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I promise. Why what\u2019s in there?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh right. This is a disaster."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What? You hold my hand you kiss my mouth but you draw the line at a hundred and two fever? What happened to our love?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Mm-hmm and what\u2019s it called when you secretly get rid of all your husband\u2019s stuff?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Uh for the record it could kill us to meet new people. They could be murderers or the carriers of unusual pathogens and I\u2019m not insane my mother had me tested."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sheldon did it ever occur to you that I might have other plans?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh a Hobbit is a mortal Halfling inhabitant of Middle Earth whereas an Elf is an immortal tall warrior."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Uh Sheldon you want to take a break? Your food\u2019s ready."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No of course not there\u2019s no cousin Leo there\u2019s no intervention focus Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m going to go inside put on my coziest pajamas curl up with a good book and wait for this nightmare to be over.  Penny. Sorry."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Can we not play this game?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"When did we get a floor safe?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Actually I thought the first two renditions were far more compelling. Previously I felt sympathy for the Leonard character now I just find him to be whiny and annoying."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Aw. What is she doing here?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Dad."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Excuse me. I happen to be very comfortable with my masculinity."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Terrific."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Not for me. Thursday is now Cruciferous Vegetable Night. Tonight\u2019s selection brussels sprouts."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You know I will miss this."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well no I just didn\u2019t think you\u2019d want a physical reminder of a game you never managed to win. As a kindness I should probably take all the games."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"We hit a couple of bumps. She lives over on Manhattan Beach so it takes over an hour to get there. And she\u2019s a lesbian."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh I miss you too."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yeah but it\u2019s not always that bad."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Uh I don\u2019t know. It was just a thought."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Ah. Nothing makes beer taste better than cool clear Rocky Mountain spring water. Where are the Rocky Mountains anyway?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"So I can\u2019t go."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes. All is forgiven so come back home. I\u2019ll make you some soy hot chocolate and then I\u2019ll you tell you about our exciting new devil-may-care bathroom policy."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"So that\u2019s what you wear to an interview?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh. Thanks."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay we\u2019re leaving love you bye."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I\u2019m very comfortable here. Penny dear why don\u2019t you shoot another silver bullet my way?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"This is a door knob."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s not about shoes is it? I don\u2019t think I could go through that again."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Wow."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"The zoot suit riots."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s still a bird in here. We are gonna get in a ton of trouble."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey pretty lady."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I meant a Hindu temple."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"We sure did."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Penny\u2019s hooking up with her jerk of an ex-boyfriend and I have indelible ink on my forehead!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"How does your brain feel about calculating the surface tension of the domain walls?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"No you weren\u2019t because it was a week ago and nobody came. So if you want to solve the mystery of who stabbed Koothrappali in the back with the weapon of indifference it was all of you."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Then put on a sweater."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh mimicry. I enjoy mimicry. I\u2019ve been working on Admiral Ackbar from Return of the Jedi. \u201cIt\u2019s a trap.\u201d You have to imagine me with a giant squid head. \u201cIt\u2019s a trap. It\u2019s a trap. It\u2019s a trap.\u201d"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh yeah I don\u2019t usually dress like this. I\u2019m going jogging."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What do you mean who cares? Look at what I pulled off here. The DJ\u2019s on fire there\u2019s a Tardis photo booth in the back room and oh my God the food. Stuart wanted Kraft Draculoni and cheese."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What is that?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard social protocol states when a friend is upset you offer them a hot beverage such as tea."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well you know I do understand what you\u2019re going through."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I love you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Thank you for coming by.  Hello."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"When you were telling Kevin about your acting career did you mention your long-running role as Waitress in a local production of The Cheesecake Factory?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh I can help you with that. Imagine you\u2019re holding an ordinary pen. While your favourite pen is safe and secure in your pocket."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Five four three two one. That\u2019s too bad."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What\u2019d you say of the idea of you and I becoming friends?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh Indians making Tex-Mex. Might as well have had the Chinese pizza."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Really?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Where are you going?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Whatever."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No that\u2019s okay."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well at least you finally got a window that opens. That\u2019s nice."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"But a cannon? Am I really out of the game?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Challenge accepted. Sounds like it\u2019s time for the Sheldon Cooper Apology Tour."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"But Papa please\u2026."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I should\u2019ve brought an umbrella."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh gee you\u2019re too late. Scarlett Johansson and Wonder Woman were just in here trolling around for neurotic little weasels."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No no no stay there. I\u2019m fine on the floor."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No you\u2019re wrong. See as you know a few years ago I achieved one of my lesser dreams and became a notary public. Well from time to time I notarize banking documents for Raj. The Koothrappalis aren\u2019t just rich they\u2019re Richie Rich rich."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It\u2019s a human emotion Sheldon. Everyone gets jealous. I\u2019m jealous of Leonard and Penny and Howard and Bernadette for being in such happy relationships."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Don\u2019t listen to him. He says crazy things all the time. Uh watch. Marco."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me. Excuse me. Hi Stuart."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Uh tell me more about this calzone idea."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What are you saying that you\u2019re giving up on me? What kind of father gives up on his son?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Your first date? Did you even measure her walls?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Will you be my valentine?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I cannot thank you enough."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh I was hoping for a juicy tidbit about Ron Perlman\u2019s testicles."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No no no I just meant for\u2026 yeah."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I almost feel sorry for the poor fool sitting in his split-level suburban ranch unaware that a vengeful horde is barrelling down the San Diego Freeway at 71 miles an hour. Ease up there lead foot. You trying to get us killed?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Great."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And a second non-tantalizing piece to use as a control."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t like trains. You like trains."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hurry. We\u2019re going to be late."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well I mean I\u2019m sitting right here. You\u2019re talking about my feelings and somehow leaving me out of the conversation."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Seriously that guy\u2019s dating two women?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What we\u2019re ready when I say we\u2019re ready. Uh-du-du-du ooh okay now we\u2019re ready."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No no no it\u2019s\u2026 oh for God\u2019s sakes gimme. "},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah.

She got Sheldon to go to a psychic with her."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No I mean it. I mean it. It\u2019s like you have the soul of a label maker."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Let me offer you a compromise. Sometimes when I feel stifled and want a change of scenery I use my imagination."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"How about dolphins?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Really?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Interrupting physicist."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh sure. Very\u2026 prominent."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"At the bottom. I must say I\u2019m relieved you\u2019re not making more of a scene out of this."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"A side of corn succotash. Hmm. Interesting."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"There\u2019s no need for compliments this court is only interested in the facts."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That\u2019s a trick question right?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019ll start again."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And I\u2019m gonna need you to sign a non-disclosure agreement."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Am I interrupting."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh better than North Dakota!  I guess that joke\u2019s only funny in Nebraska."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You brought a girl to the Mars Rover control room?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I don\u2019t get it I already told her a lie why replace it with a different lie?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay if you\u2019re going to drink on this date just promise me you won\u2019t overdo it."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What? Oh God yeah. Yeah. Leonard\u2019s a noisy little dude in the sack."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Why would they lie to us?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It may be low-tech but I still maintain the whoopee cushion has comic validity."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Eh well very well. Oh and on the topic of sharing things that are yours there is a gentleman caller bringing flowers to your fianc\u00e9e as we speak."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh really? Well I grew up with an older brother and a very contentious twin sister and I believe I could easily best you in any physical confrontation be it noogies swirlies or the classic why are you hitting yourself?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh of course it\u2019s no big deal to you. You idolize me and nothing could ever knock me off that pedestal you put me on."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Listen Leonard\u2019s mom is a renowned psychiatrist and woman of science. Can you please keep the Bible babble to yourself while she\u2019s here?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well uh okay um I don\u2019t want to get back together with Penny. We tried it it was crazy it didn\u2019t work but I can\u2019t deal with the fact that she slept with my friend Raj. And then I find out that Raj\u2019s sister Priya who I\u2019ve been going out with for eight months is moving back to India. So I\u2019m just completely confused and alone."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You\u2019re embarrassing me right now a grown man worrying about such nonsense when in the middle of flying kites."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Did you see that? He just cut the line."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Would you like to go with me?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"A whole box."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"So what are we going to do tonight?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah. We waited a few months. We can wait a few more days."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Actually he\u2019s a genius."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well then maybe you shouldn\u2019t have named her Wheelchair Kathy."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I feel like I\u2019ve been called down to the principal\u2019s office. Although I wouldn\u2019t mind if Brown Sugar suspended me. From a sex swing. This may have been a mistake."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Leonard I bought you this because I wanted you to have fun with it. I don\u2019t want it to just sit in this box."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No I\u2019m not."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I\u2026 I do enjoy the La Brea Tar Pits."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Holy crap!"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Really? I thought they were out West someplace."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Mmm. Oh cheesecake you\u2019re just as good as a woman even though I can\u2019t have sex with you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon we haven\u2019t won a game all night. Now you either stick your face in that pie or I\u2019m gonna stick that pie in your face."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"And it\u2019s done."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Don\u2019t want people to see what huh? A little bit of this?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Um okay. First off know that we all love you and cherish you."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I had pee his pants."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Thank you. "},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Champagne champagne."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sweetie you are grown up."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Help! Somebody help!"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah look. Breasts and everything."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well I shouldn\u2019t be surprised. There\u2019s a rich history of brilliant minds descending into madness."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Sixty seconds. This is not looking good."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Aha! So I am working with you."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Leonard please let me go."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Never mind. I clearly woke you up in the middle of a REM cycle you\u2019re in no state to talk."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"We could but we always run the risk of someone else beating us to the punch."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"My God how fast were you going?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"With my life."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"End things? I\u2019m trying to tell you that I love you."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"About twenty."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Oh God just finish the sentence. Okay well I\u2019m sorry you feel that way. Bye. No one wants to hear my apologies."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Unless he takes Bernadette\u2019s last name. And considering her advanced status that could open some doors for him."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"My turn."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I was but Penny didn\u2019t want to. You didn\u2019t want to. Bernadette Amy Koothrappali and Wolowitz didn\u2019t want to. And even I knew it was weird to hire somebody."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I hope the bathroom is clearly marked."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Like what?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Ooh yes. Fun."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Just sit."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Alright and Raj."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No I wouldn\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay you know what? It\u2019s lame when I say it it\u2019s just ridiculous when you pile on."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Have you had intercourse?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh please?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"A death ray?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I could use the bathroom at 820."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Why not."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"That\u2019s probably it. What\u2019d you say to her?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I\u2019m just not really in the mood anymore."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay come with me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh excited concerned a little scared. All the same emotions I feel in line at Space Mountain."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"For me it was a bonding moment."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What? Wh where\u2019s the judgment? Wh where\u2019s the fire and brimstone? Where\u2019s the part where you tell us we\u2019re going to Hell and I say have you seen the size of the bugs outside? We\u2019re already there."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh please. I admit that spherical chicken joke that was hilarious. But it was straight downhill from there."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Why the rush? She isn\u2019t going anywhere."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Wow. You are cute when you get all gangsta. "},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"It\u2019s getting kind of cheesy Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Let\u2019s do this."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Then what do you need?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"No no this is brand new. We haven\u2019t even been on a proper date yet."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right if no one\u2019s going to guess I was spying the aluminium rims on the police car we passed a few miles back."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You told me not to call and I didn\u2019t know how else to give you the good news. Fun with Flags is back and you can be in the next episode."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes that good news."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"The kid got a girl."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You initialed it. See? L.H. L.H. L.H."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No don\u2019t make it so. Barry we can\u2019t fight you tomorrow our engineer is incapacitated."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Nope. Now the Lisatronic 3000 just sits in a box waiting for the phone to ring."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh my God. What happened?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Of course I can. It\u2019s coming back under the residual effects of the anaesthesia that\u2019s the problem. Two years ago after a deep gum cleaning I thought I got on a bus but somehow wound up on a booze cruise to Mexico."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sheldon may I ask you a question?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Don\u2019t worry this is exactly how you look when you\u2019re dancing in clubs."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Kripke."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"All right."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"How? Unlike me you have a job. I\u2019m just gonna have to go back to being a waitress like I will be for the rest of my life."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh obviously it\u2019s gonna happen. Yeah a psychic at a bachelorette party told me so. Anyway what I meant was I shouldn\u2019t wait you know? I\u2019ve got you I\u2019ve got Sheldon all these wonderful friends. My life is exciting right now."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"They let me blow the whistle Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"There was one time I put body glitter on."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Get out."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Remind me to compliment Wolowitz on the software it\u2019s amazingly detailed."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"But I never will."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Just not against their will."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You are not Isaac Newton."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m sorry?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Lettuce shredded not chopped?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No no. It\u2019s about my acting career."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Thank you. May I share something with you that\u2019s troubling me?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah so are you."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It\u2019s funny because bread sounds like dead."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah that was five weeks ago. How much longer is he gonna milk that cow?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Eh no he\u2019s not going to eat it is he?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I quoted your favourite Nsync song."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"This is Asian fusion. For all you know there\u2019s a tiny Chihuahua in here."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"So with all those antioxidants what if I run out of oxidants?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"They\u2019re not even trying. Remember the Satanimals pack with the Hellephant? Why absurd. What was he a bad elephant who died and went to hell? What could an elephant possibly do that would cause him eternal damnation?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Excuse me Amy. Penny do you have plans for dinner tonight?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Exactly except you don\u2019t have a lunatic running around yelling I fed you sugar water why are you biting me? Come on this is boring you really want to talk about this?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"When is it?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay let\u2019s go."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s silly. Almost as silly as Dr. Baker having a telephone since telephones only existed in large cities at that time. This is more like Little House on the Preposterous."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Intriguing."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Uh turn left here and see if he turns with us."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Go online and look it up."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"He\u2019s right. But in my defence if we could survive that we could survive anything."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That\u2019s true."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh. I know what about that bed-and-breakfast?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"No it\u2019s just that everybody\u2019s got someone. Sheldon\u2019s with Amy Howard\u2019s getting married you\u2019re dating my sister."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh how many times do I have to say it?

Can\u2019t you at least try to understand how much this means to me?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No. That\u2019s it. I am calling campus security. You prepare for the scolding of your life."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I don\u2019t have to believe in it for her to be lucky."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Which I find totally unacceptable. I must be the bigger man. Therefore you may use my spot until such time as I learn to drive or get a Batmobile."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Of course. Pets are banned under the roommate agreement with the exception of service animals such as seeing eye dogs and one day cybernetically-enhanced helper monkeys."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"They put you under for a cleaning?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey if I roll down the windows in the car everything\u2019s peachy. If you do it you\u2019re still not a doctor."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m sorry that\u2019s the end of your inquiry?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I\u2019m going to write you a cheque for that. As long as you promise to put it in your drawer and never cash it like the others."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well you know It\u2019s easy to take each other for granted and I never want to do that to you because your love it\u2019s like a river. It\u2019s peaceful and deep. Your soul is it\u2019s like a secret that I could never keep."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah but you were neither."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You think he bites?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What why not?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"By the way how are you with zippers?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It\u2019s completely inappropriate for a single woman to entertain a man in private. If you insist on talking you must do it on the couch! All right you may talk in the bedroom but I want this door to remain open! All right just this once you may close the door. But keep in mind I\u2019ll be right out here monitoring the situation!  Priya this is your brother. When you get this tell Leonard to check his voicemail."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You don\u2019t like written suggestions. You don\u2019t like when I give them to you while we\u2019re urinating in the men\u2019s room. If I didn\u2019t know any better I\u2019d say that you\u2019re one of those stubborn people who are not open to suggestions."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You think they came up with that? They were going to drink beer and play darts."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well that\u2019s wonderful. Congratulations."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"So anyway last night on video chat I spent like twenty minutes just staring into Lucy\u2019s eyes."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Huh. All this time I never knew there were steam tunnels down here."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh that was a dead end. Scrambled eggs are as good as they\u2019re ever going to be."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah my point is it\u2019s a waste of time."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh dear."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"He\u2019s been crying?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sheldon I\u2019m so sorry I dragged you through this."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well she was upset at first but probably because her sister shot somebody. Then there was something about you and\u2026 then she hugged me."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh my God we\u2019re gonna kill them."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Excuse me in a world that already includes the Big Boy why would I settle for something like a Big Boy?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Was I hit on the head by a coconut."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No I\u2019m Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Wait we\u2019re gonna get married again?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Maybe. But this isn\u2019t about them it\u2019s about us."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Hey guys."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Mm. I found this quiz online called Which Star Trek Character Are You? and it only took me four tries to get Captain Kirk."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Clever but also wrong. No the best organism for human beings to merge with is the lichen itself. That way you\u2019d be human fungus and algae. Triple threat. Like three-bean salad."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Okay."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Sheldon I can\u2019t believe you got us a wedding gift."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Any news on your co-worker who\u2019s in the hospital?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Ooh maybe I could turn it into a gaming den."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Uh something like this. I don\u2019t know. It came free with a full tank of gas."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh my God the George Smoot?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I will. Why are you making this such a big deal?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Aw what horrible thing are you trying to make up for?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What\u2019s up?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yes please shut up. So um Dave don\u2019t you think you and I should get back to the lab? You know that dark matter isn\u2019t going to detect itself."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What do you think you\u2019re doing?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well he\u2019s in my bed. Why can\u2019t I be in his?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Ah Alex excellent. I have a research problem that I believe you can help with."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"A group of cats is a clowder. Or a glaring."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"And we\u2019ve built it up in our heads so much."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You know I\u2019m growing to like American football."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah okay. Listen I need to talk to Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Perfect. Now we really are in a Mexican standoff. Is this one of those times where I\u2019ve won the battle but lost the war?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Hey Stuart."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay good. She seemed like she really wanted to go out tonight."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019ll take your word for it. I was too busy trying not to defecate."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey you didn\u2019t want a Slurpee at 7-Eleven you don\u2019t get glasses."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Good for you. Sign here."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well he\u2019s in my bed. Why can\u2019t I be in his?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely. What time is your date?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"So listen to what he wrote. Uh I saw you play at the comic book store. You guys rock. And then there\u2019s an animated smiley face raising the roof like this."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Think about this. The only way your mother was born was your Meemaw had sex."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It\u2019s a quark-gluon plasma."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well thank you. And Leonard never lets me have French toast sticks in the car. I can\u2019t have syrupy fingers but he can do the backstroke in a toilet bowl."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Come on you were gonna go up in a rocket designed in the 1960s by the Russians."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"So it spells Sheldon?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No I just want to know that when you\u2019re at work there\u2019s nothing going on."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s a drawing of a really cool train. Don\u2019t look at that either. What do you want?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Um let\u2019s see. Hiking. Karaoke in Koreatown. Any Jennifer Aniston movie."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Mm.

So it went beyond the mere fact of coitus to a blow by blow as it were."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well by that logic I should be with someone short dull and needy eh? Not to cast aspersions but I can\u2019t shake a stick around here without hitting that."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah well it\u2019s easy for you to say. You used to be famous."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Howard is employing a schoolyard paradigm in which you are for all intents and purposes deceased. He intends to act on this by not speaking to you feigning an inability to hear you when you speak and otherwise refusing to acknowledge your existence."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah. I\u2019m just returning my uniform."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Howard."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well we\u2019ll just see how your noxious gas fares against my cinnamon-apple-scented aroma therapy candles."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"It doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m not keeping this. I\u2019m trying to pay my own way and be responsible. Taking handouts won\u2019t help that."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Don\u2019t say that. I mean you\u2019re not Dame Judi Dench but you\u2019re pretty great."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I think we should be good neighbours invite her over make her feel welcome."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh really?

Where are you going? Penny come back! I\u2019ll get you ice cream!"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"That doesn\u2019t seem to be where I shine.

Um I suppose I\u2019ve always been into science you know. My mother and father are scientists so I was kind of led in that direction. Uh pushed might be a better way to describe it. To be honest with you guys when I was your age I wanted to be a rap star. Like Snoop Dogg but with a healthy respect for the police. Yeah no sure you laugh. Just like my mother did. After I confided I was derided and chided my moms and I collided. She said my dreams were misguided. That\u2019s just a little freestyle."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"You\u2019re right I can\u2019t. You know what? Anyone could rent that apartment now an opera singer the cast of stomp yeah a tap-dancing pirate with a wooden leg."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Sucker. Didn\u2019t even ask for the friends and family discount."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"You two should be ashamed of yourselves. Using women to advance your cause with sexuality and whatever Amy plans on doing."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Thank you. You\u2019re not done with her are you?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"It\u2019s a little insulting don\u2019t you think?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Seriously? You haven\u2019t used this desk in years. The second I want to get rid of it you\u2019re up here working?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Of course you\u2019d focus on that rather than the inspiration. Uh new salon topic. What\u2019s more important an idea or its execution?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Doesn\u2019t anyone want to know where he\u2019s going?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What else have you been thinking about doing?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh Leonard. Lots of people love you and want to help you but they can\u2019t until you admit the problem."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Why do people cry at weddings?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Ooh me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"And yet now you\u2019re in my office.

Good night."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Still sounds like a lot of unnecessary touching."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Yeah me too."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"How much beer have you had?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well if that\u2019s the case then your grandparents mumble and have bad posture."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That is true. I have a higher than normal body density. If I run too deep a bath I drown."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well now see? You knew what was gonna happen. Why didn\u2019t they? Anyway now we\u2019re committed to completing this project in a ridiculously short time frame and everyone\u2019s upset with me."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I hope his character doesn\u2019t make it into the movie he\u2019s kind of a bummer."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Oh they think we\u2019re flanking they\u2019re playing right into our hands.

You got a fifty-fifty shot."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No I told her she was being not smart. Which was dumb."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hang on. Are you now or have you ever been a salsa Irish folk or break-dancer?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Not like I guess I\u2019m in. Like I guess I\u2019m in!"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Okay now that everyone\u2019s here we can begin."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Isn\u2019t that their burden? I\u2019m the one with something interesting to say."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Little Lalita. That\u2019s kind of fun to say. Little Lalita Little Lalita Little Lalita you should try it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yes you did didn\u2019t you?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Can you keep him quiet?

I\u2019m the king of foreplay."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah well tell it to someone who cares."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I\u2019m just saying you pretend you don\u2019t but you have feelings just like everybody else."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Chuck Norris wishes. In binary 73 is a palindrome one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one which backwards is one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one exactly the same. All Chuck Norris backwards gets you is Sirron Kcuhc."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No I did not."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh no the new ones they\u2019re here."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Really? You can\u2019t think of anyone weirder?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I\u2019m not gonna fall in love with Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Is it safe to assume you\u2019re not speaking to me again? If you\u2019re not answering because you\u2019re not speaking to me perhaps we could come up with a signal. That works."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Fascinating."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Darts is a bar game. You\u2019ve been frequenting drinking establishments since you were of legal age."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Well you could be very frugal. I\u2019m getting a little tired of everybody\u2019s sarcasm."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Team Baby go."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Actually they were only digging in the wrong place because Indy had the medallion. Without him they would have had the medallion and dug in the right place."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"No I can\u2019t.

If you were to prevent yourself from buying it in the past you would not have it available in the present to travel back and stop yourself from buying it ergo you would still have it.

Really give ourselves a challenge."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right but you\u2019re not fooling me. Whenever you say we have to talk it means you want me to listen."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay listen to me. Your relationship can handle being long distance for a while. It\u2019s not like you two are very physical."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"I don\u2019t have one."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Why do I bother talking to you people?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Seriously?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No no I understand. Anything happened to my mee-maw I\u2019d be one inconsolable moon pie. I should clarify that statement by explaining that she calls me moon pie."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You don\u2019t even know what it is do you? The anthropic principle states that if we wish to explain why our universe exists the way it does the answer is that it must have qualities that allow intelligent creatures to arise who are capable of asking the question. As I am doing so eloquently right now."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay if that\u2019s true why aren\u2019t there more genius squirrels?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Probably serving food that was ordered today."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Um does this have anything to do with Leonard\u2019s work?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Then it\u2019s settled."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"It is a big whoop.

No more murder mystery parties."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well I need a wingman. I don\u2019t want to come off like a lonely loser."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Oh. Well I have some work to do so\u2026"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It\u2019s a lease."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Why did you tell Howard I was hiding Leonard\u2019s things?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Would you like to hear another reason why men are better than women?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes well I\u2019m polymerised tree sap and you\u2019re non-organic adhesive so whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction is reflected off of me returns on its original trajectory and adheres to you."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"If I were you I\u2019d be more concerned by what they\u2019re passing off as chicken."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I want you to admit that what you did was wrong."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I made tea."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Again not enough evidence. For all we know he\u2019s being murdered. Now back to our game."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019m not defacing it I\u2019m fixing it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Just making polite dinner conversation. Your turn."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"You mean like fatties and uggos?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Wise decision. You see Amy success at a bar is based on classic male attributes such as height strength attractiveness the ability to hold one\u2019s liquor and throw darts separately or together. Leonard has none of these attributes right Leonard?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I\u2019m taking you home."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Aw hell I miss him."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"The learning opportunities would be abundant. Additionally I like having my belly scratched."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"You still didn\u2019t pick a date."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey you know what Leonard I know I said I could handle your roommate but I was wrong. We\u2019re going to have to break up."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"If only Penny had said that once in a while."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"It\u2019s fantastic apparently the camera loves me and I it. They shot me in front of a starry background where I posed like this.  They\u2019re going to digitally add a supernova they say it\u2019s the perfect metaphor for my incandescent talent."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Oh well then you you do it."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Calm down. Howard has something he wants to say to you."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Just tell me which one you think is more manly. This hockey jersey or this football jersey."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"You still told her I lied."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Well what are we waiting for? Let\u2019s bounce bitches."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh no of course. I understand. You\u2019re afraid the world isn\u2019t ready for your taboo love. Your secret\u2019s safe with me."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay but something smells fishy. And not just because you work around sea animals. That actually sounds interesting and I\u2019d like to learn more about it. Hey you okay?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No I can still hear it. Oh wait that\u2019s me. Never mind it\u2019s fine."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh yes."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Well for one thing we\u2019re late for Leonard\u2019s birthday party. And for another I told him to call security."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"We could be betas. They\u2019re second in charge."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Ooh. Maybe I like it."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hey I was just\u2026 what is happening?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yeah and some thanks I got. The assistant manager chased me out with an artisanal salami."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh what did he say?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well then tell your face."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Okay as soon as she gets here so she knows I\u2019m cool with it I\u2019m going to make a joke about her being deaf. I was thinking hey did you hear the one about\u2026? Oh no I bet you didn\u2019t."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"What is shaking?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Uh-huh."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Are you implementing phase two?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"And about three hundred dollars worth of makeup so this thief could look like anyone right now."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"All right well to sum up focus on science keep your nose out of other people\u2019s business and uh whoa for a good time call Bert."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Get anything good?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Thank you all for this high honour."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"No. Or to use the clinical term nuh-uh."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I want to leave."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Yes."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"For three months?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Leonard why do you always do this? Listen to me you\u2019re the one I\u2019m with. You know I love you so will you please relax because you\u2019re driving me crazy."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m sorry is he waiting for someone to disagree?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Does it really need to say that?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"I\u2019m going to a party. I\u2019m not turning R2-D2 and C-3PO over to the empire!"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"All right let\u2019s buckle down and work."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"He won\u2019t be mad at me.

We should watch it."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I\u2019m sorry how is this better than uncomfortable silence?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Women. Who knows what\u2019ll set \u2019em off?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Lesley this is Penny she lives across the hall from Sheldon and me."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Okay look I know what a good person you are but sometimes people think you might come off a little harsh."},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Hey Sheldon."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019ll pull the van up."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What if I get caught?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Great. Now Mandarin."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay uh what if we make Rocket Man your ringtone and the next time you talk to those guys I\u2019ll call you and they\u2019ll hear it. Plant the seed."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Whoa whoa. Walking up to a strange woman in a bar usually doesn\u2019t work."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019m sorry are you under the impression that we\u2019re still friends?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"And that is how a short asthmatic scientist landed a stone cold fox."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Is he okay?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Okay I\u2019m going to play it cool. Tell her maybe. Whatever babe."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hey. Is everything smoothed out with Amy?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Hi Stephanie. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m late but your companion left the most indecipherable invitation."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Oh. What if Leonard made an appointment and tried to lay some groundwork for you?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"That\u2019s right Sheldon Cooper. He was bitten by his neighbour\u2019s dog leading to his first scientific breakthrough the doggie death-ray. Which sadly he couldn\u2019t build because Santa wouldn\u2019t bring him enriched uranium."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"And he\u2019s picking the tomatoes out of his salad just like I do. I always did feel a connection with him. Oh I have got an idea."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Well that explains those puzzling camel race photos on your Facebook page."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"What time do you and Bernadette head out?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"Step one worms."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"When I have enough to destroy all the human toast on the battlestar known as Galactica. Is that what you\u2019re wearing to watch football at Penny\u2019s?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Still doesn\u2019t explain how you ended up on the freeway divider."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"This is preposterous. I think you\u2019re giving me these tasks because you\u2019re afraid if you give me anything meaningful to do I\u2019ll show you up."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"I\u2019m sorry this does not look like Texas. Where\u2019s the tumbleweeds? Where\u2019s the saloons?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Well glad you\u2019re feeling better."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Whatever you do just don\u2019t make any rash decisions."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Anyway any ideas on a gift?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Sure."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Since when do you take after-dinner walks?"},{"Speaker":"Penny","Text":"What did you tell them?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Although for the record on one occasion she licked her thumb to remove raspberry jelly from the corner of my mouth. It\u2019s an action we both regret to this day."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"We can still be swashers."},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"What? Another one. You know it it\u2019s weird. When they\u2019re reading your profile does it does it make you feel exposed? Like they see you naked?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Yes?  Peace?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Your cousin Leopold?"},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"No but you\u2019re right. I should march over there and ask her out."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Not bad I myself started graduate school at fourteen."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Ummm I\u2019m gonna go with \u201cno.\u201d"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"I can\u2019t stop thinking about it."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"And we made it in only three hours.

And you thought Spock ears were only good for Comic-Con."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"Hang on. Can you do any better?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"The housekeeper does the shopping."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Oh how I wish I could."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"I did not get a clear answer. I\u2019m gonna set this down now."},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"They would wouldn\u2019t they? We could give them cool Martian names. And we could teach them about Martian history. Like who planted those flags? And uh where did that copy of Mars Attacks! come from?"},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"No no I don\u2019t know if I should. If she wanted me to know about her blog she would\u2019ve told me. It\u2019s almost like I\u2019m reading her diary."},{"Speaker":"Raj","Text":"Is this just so we won\u2019t touch your stuff while you\u2019re away?"},{"Speaker":"Sheldon","Text":"Unlikely. That\u2019s a television show Leonard."},{"Speaker":"Leonard","Text":"What are you gonna do?"},{"Speaker":"Howard","Text":"Yeah well I do. And when my wingman is carrying a Green Lantern lantern I drink a lot. I\u2019ll have a screwdriver please.

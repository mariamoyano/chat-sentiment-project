0,Leonard,Again I’m right here.
1,Sheldon,Fine. The record shall so reflect. Now getting back to the problem at hand what to do with a washed-up experimental physicist.
2,Sheldon,One two three four five six seven eight… Drat. I’m never going to get to forty-three again. One two three four… Rats.
3,Sheldon,I’m not sure. Earlier tonight things began organically and now it’s feeling forced like all the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels.
4,Leonard,He’s finding the acoustic sweet spot.
6,Howard,Uh yeah last night. He kept making me drop pencils for him. I got uncomfortable.  che-ee-ee-ese.
7,Penny,What?
8,Leonard,There was a flier on the bulletin board at the university. Roommate wanted. Whistlers need not apply.
9,Sheldon,Oh. A small human wreaks havoc on his wife’s genitals and he gets time off.
10,Leonard,Can we please change the subject.
11,Leonard,Here it is. There’s a black light.
12,Penny,He would get his own place.
13,Leonard,You okay?
14,Penny,Kurt!
15,Leonard,Yeah but Sheldon and Amy were having date night and they don’t need me there to make it awkward. They have each other for that. So how was school?
16,Leonard,Okay well goodnight. 
17,Leonard,Positive.
18,Sheldon,A sigma particle.
19,Sheldon,He’s not wrong. It was your crackpot idea that he deserves love.
20,Raj,Well if you want privacy let go of the ring. I’m so glad we came to this gentile strip club! Howard here’s more bacon to tuck into the shiksa’s G-string!
21,Sheldon,That does it. I’m getting uranium.
22,Raj,What are you doing?
23,Penny,Oh now I’m a child? Well at least I’m not an idiot anymore!
24,Sheldon,Normally I’d feel the same way. But based on everything I’ve observed about us I can’t help but speculate we’d be very good together.
25,Penny,Definitely.
26,Leonard,I’m just gonna go home and let my work speak for itself.
27,Sheldon,Oh Leonard there you are I’m ready to go home.
29,Leonard,You have no idea how much you inconvenience the lives of everyone around you. It’s exhausting.
30,Penny,Yeah I guess.
31,Leonard,As it turns out she was a North Korean spy. Luckily Sheldon drove her out before I revealed anything important. Which I’m not saying I would have.
32,Sheldon,I have paperwork that says differently.
33,Leonard,We’re really more….
34,Leonard,I wonder why she didn’t say good-bye.
35,Sheldon,Because he’s not like us Penny. We’re dreamers.
36,Howard,No I was in India it was humid and smelled funny.
37,Leonard,You just wave your arms a little and they fly away it’s not…
38,Penny,Sweetie I’m so sorry. I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better.
39,Penny,Oh. Well good boy.
40,Leonard,Mitzy’s dead?
41,Penny,Okay good ’cause that’s what I want too.
42,Raj,Let’s set up the equipment. It’ll help take your mind off of it.
43,Penny,Sharp. Thanks to the machine we saw earlier.
44,Sheldon, Amy. Hmm. Tables work too. Good to know.
45,Howard,The Fantastic Four reunited.
46,Penny,All right. Terrific. Well let me just go find a pair of shoes that aren’t so tall. We wouldn’t want you to feel like you were out for a walk with your mommy.
47,Sheldon,  Penny.
48,Howard,Way to make lemonade. You know from around the corner where fudge is made.
49,Leonard,Where exactly did your mother have you tested?
50,Sheldon,Come in.
51,Penny,But he’s sad.
52,Leonard,Hi.
53,Raj,Do you have a preference?
54,Howard,Hello.
55,Sheldon,Well…
56,Penny,Yeah it was.
57,Penny,And you thought my acting lessons were a waste of money.
59,Sheldon,I don’t think it worked.
60,Penny,When a suitcase just won’t do.
61,Leonard,Will you at least think about it? Just as a favour to me?
62,Howard,I can’t see him.
63,Leonard,You know what? Why don’t we just forget about them and enjoy our Valentine’s Day?
64,Leonard,Oh Sheldon stop it.
65,Leonard,Wil can we just turn off the podcast for a little bit?
66,Sheldon,See? That’s what I thought. But then they go and throw in an ESRAM buffer.
67,Leonard,You can’t say that anymore.
68,Sheldon,Great. I’ll start packing. In a minute.  Oh look it’s the cholermus.
69,Leonard,Squeeze yourself.
70,Penny,Oh thank you so much. It feels so good to hear you say that. And I want you to know that I get this job kind of changes the balance in our relationship and I’m trying to be sensitive to that.
71,Howard,Emily your face is like a precious dew-kissed flower.
73,Sheldon,Interesting. I can’t think of a single thing I wouldn’t say to someone’s face.
74,Sheldon,I know.
75,Sheldon,Leonard I’m hungry!
76,Leonard,No what’s disgusting is he’s still keeping track.
77,Raj,I thought she was the whore of Omaha?
78,Sheldon,Oh great. Now I’m worse than a fraud. I’m practically a biologist.
79,Raj,I was so smooth on that date.
80,Penny,Good. Your mom seems nice.
81,Sheldon,Well can you believe she said I embarrassed her?
82,Howard,It’s okay.
83,Penny,You know my aunt changed her diet and in a few months she…
84,Penny,Sure. Oh we had one of these growing up. I used to play all the time.
85,Sheldon,I looked over the board and it turns out you were right.
86,Howard,Okay you’re right I got myself into this but I’ve never missed a Comic-Con with you guys.
87,Howard,Hello.
88,Raj,Excuse me but how are we going to make any modifications without Wolowitz? Have you heard from Penny yet?
89,Leonard,Yeah we won’t be eating Arthur tonight.
90,Leonard,Yeah she does.
91,Raj,Well I can’t take all the credit. She let me do it to her but uh but I can always call her and cancel.
92,Penny,I don’t know. This is all starting to feel like a sad attempt to recapture our youth.
93,Penny,Oh hey no you don’t have to apologize. There’s no reason you have to tell me. I was just you know surprised.
94,Penny,Not in a rush busy with work…
95,Sheldon,Good choice it’s disgusting.
96,Leonard,Hey.
97,Sheldon,Oh no it will. See by keeping my mind engaged I’ll become more focused.
98,Sheldon,We don’t have that option we’ve accepted the challenge. We can’t run away from a fight.
99,Penny,Uh no. Actually I didn’t invite her.
100,Sheldon,It is remarkable.
101,Sheldon,Wait. Wait. And says?
102,Penny,Okay show’s over.
105,Sheldon,Fourteen and a half.
106,Raj,Well there’s no toilets we’ll have to do our business in a bucket.
107,Leonard,Listen we did a stupid thing.
108,Howard,Hey hey do you hear yourselves? Let’s just you know all calm down and take a step back.
109,Penny,Oh come on you know Leonard’s had girls over before right?
110,Sheldon,Complete with bulletproof bracelets and lasso of truth. Invisible plane sold separately.
111,Raj,Oh my God I think you broke my toe!
112,Sheldon,Okay I’m gonna let that slide because I know you’re hopped up on tea bags.
113,Penny,You make a cute Green Arrow.
114,Sheldon,What are you doing? You have to start with the edges.
115,Sheldon,Is it kung pao chicken?
116,Leonard,That’s great. Get out.
117,Penny,Well I’m watching it now. Why would I want to see it again on Friday?
118,Sheldon,Although unlike your date she actually showed up. Oh he looks sad again.
119,Sheldon,I didn’t want to upset you. Howard made it very clear that my allegiance should be to male comrades before women who sell their bodies for money.
120,Sheldon,Oh I have a solution first go into the future and obtain a cloaking device.
121,Raj,I know. Blue shag what were you thinking?
122,Leonard,She doesn’t flirt with doctors.
123,Leonard,What are you doing?
124,Raj,I’ve uh created some other user accounts so I can post positive comments about their paper.
125,Sheldon,This isn’t fair. You’ve discussed aspects of our physical relationship with Penny.
126,Raj,I’m sorry. I did what I could.
127,Penny,Yeah. I’m just a little surprised you didn’t tell me.
128,Raj,She was blowing a spit bubble. It was adorable.
129,Leonard,Your company?
130,Howard,Oh we’re scientists.
131,Raj,It’s not creepy. I built a Footprints on the Moon fan page Trent joined it.
132,Penny,How?
133,Penny,How come we can’t think of something we both want to do?
134,Howard,Okay gotta go.
135,Penny,It doesn’t matter why he told me. It’s true isn’t it?
136,Penny,Oh this is ridiculous. What?
137,Leonard,Drink whatever you want.
138,Leonard,No.
139,Penny,Besides I don’t need six hours of your hair is different why did you change your hair? I’m holding my breath until your hair grows back.
140,Leonard,I know it’s crazy. Welcome to the Thunderdome people. 
141,Sheldon,Actually I was wondering if I could add a third new chess piece. How do you think people would feel about Prince Joey the king’s feeble-minded but well-meaning cousin?
142,Sheldon,Oh yes.
143,Leonard,Wow y-yeah sure. Yeah no problem. Uh Here’s my home number here’s my cell here’s my office here’s my parents’ number up in New Jersey they always know how to reach me. So…
144,Penny,Sheldon doesn’t Amy look hot? That’s got to put some starch in the upper flermin.
145,Sheldon,Cookie.
146,Penny,Please show us?
147,Penny,I know. I just need you stop talking.
148,Leonard,So it’s settled. You’ll stay with us.
149,Penny,Oh God I don’t know Sheldon are you Star Wars?
150,Howard,Yeah. Mrs. Wolowitz was pretty special. When I first moved to America Howard was my only friend and she made me feel so welcome in her home. Which says a lot because those first few years she thought I was the gardener.
151,Leonard,Superceded!
152,Sheldon,Don’t know.
153,Sheldon,Excellent! What are you planning to wear?
154,Howard,It is.
155,Howard,That what that’s for? In India the lid just touches the cheese. Of course we also have rampant poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera so a little cardboard in our cheese is no biggie.
156,Leonard,That is very mature of you so I’m gonna go ahead and say suckah.
157,Penny,Oh hi. What’s going on?
158,Sheldon,Why’s that?
159,Raj,Plus no one stole their pants.
160,Penny,Are you kidding me?
161,Raj,Legoland seems like a hollow dream now.
162,Leonard,You’re the other baby.
163,Leonard,You think?
164,Leonard,Really? The old Asian man is not your Meemaw?
165,Penny,Well he has a job. How bad can it be?
166,Sheldon,That’s not an apology simply an acknowledgement that I was right.
167,Raj,Unbelievable.
168,Howard,You’re such a child.
169,Penny,You were but somehow I held myself back.
170,Leonard,I’m sorry. I’m never mind.
171,Sheldon,Very well.
172,Raj,May I have a grasshopper with a little umbrella please?
173,Howard,Uurgh.
174,Sheldon,Thank you. You just robbed me of the opportunity to stumble upon the figurine and make the oh-so-satisfying journey from discovery to desire to possession.
175,Sheldon,Thanks Grandma.
176,Sheldon,Details Leonard the success or failure of our deceitful enterprise turns on details.
177,Howard,Oh no that’s mine.
178,Leonard,You left with his date. Friends don’t do that to each other.
179,Leonard,You worked out all the math.
180,Leonard,Okay.
181,Sheldon,Oh other than waiting out the exponential growth period of the virulent organisms trooping through my microvilli into my circulatory system hunky-dory.  Did I say something amusing?
182,Howard,The polite response is thank you for noticing.
183,Leonard,Then why did you?
184,Sheldon,Okay. Um what is the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics?
185,Sheldon,Penny please we’re facing a far more serious problem than stray arachnids.
186,Penny,Then swim to Cuba.
187,Howard,You can do both like Michael Jackson’s Billie Jean. While you’re dancing you’re thinking like darn it whose baby is it?
188,Sheldon,You’re right. My apologies.
189,Leonard,No.
190,Leonard,I’m really sorry Sheldon.
191,Leonard,Sheldon I’m not taking you to Switzerland.
192,Howard,I’m signing off now.
193,Leonard,What are you thinking?
194,Sheldon,She’s right. You know I just learned Amy went to a theme park without me but I’m not going to ruin her birthday. I’ll wait and ruin 24 individual hours sprinkled throughout the year. Boop.
195,Sheldon,Things are good right now.
196,Sheldon,Sleepy kitty.
197,Penny,He loves that movie.
198,Sheldon,So goofing off. As I was saying I’m done with work and Leonard’s not. So good news you get to take me home. Play your cards right I’ll let you drive me past the lot where the buses park at night.
199,Leonard,Hey why don’t we all move over there so Leslie can join us.
200,Sheldon,Heated to 180 degrees?
203,Raj,What else have you been thinking about doing?
204,Raj,Yeah if your mom could see her little Bar Mitzvah boy right now she’d have a heart attack.
205,Penny,Does he even like lemon bars?
206,Sheldon,No. You too are safe.
207,Penny,My point is I do not judge a book by its cover. I am interested in the person underneath.
208,Raj,I uh I suppose I could stay for some dessert.
209,Leonard,We’d still get in but first I’d hit you over the head with his stick chair.
211,Leonard,Fine. But can’t we go home and start this?
212,Penny,I’ve been responsible for my own buzz since 2003. Another round for me and my homegirl.
214,Leonard,What does that mean?
215,Leonard,Come on you know how it is with break-ups.
216,Leonard,I don’t think Penny’s ever coming here again.
217,Howard,You know Amy I don’t even think you and I have had a real conversation. Let’s use tonight to get to know each other a little better. You start.
218,Leonard,What are you worried about?
219,Sheldon,This is a restaurant. It’s lunchtime. I would think as a waitress you’d be familiar with the paradigm.
220,Leonard,Nicely done Howard.
221,Sheldon,Yeah but you’ve got a can-do attitude and that’s what’s important.
222,Leonard,Is that it?
223,Leonard,Okay yeah fine.
224,Leonard,Because we didn’t want to be disturbed.
225,Sheldon,Wrong. The best number is 73. You’re probably wondering why.
226,Howard,You know when Cinnamon won’t take her medicine I hide it in a piece of cheese.
227,Leonard,You want some Oreos?
228,Raj,I don’t know. Maybe Jughead’s a Terminator.
229,Raj,Hello Sheldon.
230,Raj,Hey guys. Sorry I am so late. I was on the phone with my mother.
231,Sheldon,You know what that’s not a flag question. Next caller.
232,Penny,Good night Leonard.
233,Sheldon,I understand. Either way I want you to know that I’m aware of how difficult I can be. So I just want to say thank you for putting up with me.
234,Leonard,Penny I can still drive you.
235,Leonard,No.
236,Sheldon,Any word on my stolen items?
237,Leonard,Is Thai food okay with you Penny?
238,Penny,Okay.
239,Sheldon,You have to help it’s in the roommate agreement.
240,Leonard,Yeah.
241,Penny,It’s open.
242,Penny,Yeah I got it.
243,Leonard,Yeah. I had higher hopes for a movie called Serial Ape-ist 2 Monkey See Monkey Kill. You know it’s still possible for you to be good in a bad movie.
244,Raj,Here let me help you.
245,Penny,Exactly.
246,Sheldon,Stop. We can’t do this it’s not right.
247,Sheldon,We’re going to be late. I’m pacing nervously.
248,Howard,How do you know what the exact temperature of the room is?
249,Leonard,We’re gonna write an application…
250,Sheldon,Oh good! You’re just in time. I believe I’ve isolated the algorithm for making friends.
251,Raj,Uh.
252,Sheldon,Hmm. You sure your mothlike personality won’t be drawn to this blazing fire that is myself?
253,Sheldon,I am.
254,Leonard,Doesn’t sound that bad.
255,Sheldon,Mommy I love you. Don’t let Spock take me to the future!
256,Sheldon,I spilled grape juice.
257,Sheldon,I don’t drink coffee.
258,Penny,What is your point?
259,Howard,You really think so?
260,Penny,He’s bringing me. Who are you bringing?
261,Penny,Good for you sweetie. Okay next question. What is the quantum mechanical effect used to encode data on hard disk drives? Howard.
262,Howard,Okay.
263,Penny,Yep.
264,Penny,Shut up. You can do that? I mean wouldn’t that solve the world’s energy crisis?
265,Sheldon,Oh I know. I’m now an independent contractor.
266,Leonard,Maybe we could get Batman to actually show up.
267,Penny,Interesting.
268,Howard,Thank you sir. 
269,Sheldon,Yeah I do. Which is why I got Amy this.
270,Penny,I would have thought at a miniature horse show.
271,Leonard,It’ll be fine. You’ll see. Sheldon? Buddy? 
272,Sheldon,Someone will show.
274,Sheldon,Where?
275,Leonard,It’s not me it’s my new ringtone. The Joker from Batman.
276,Sheldon,Then I believe we’ve arrived at another quintessential rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock moment.
277,Leonard,What are you doing here?
278,Leonard,I don’t know I’ve never reneged on a proffer of sperm before.
279,Penny,The hell do you think you’re going?
280,Sheldon,That’s what you said.
281,Raj,Hello.
282,Penny,Yeah. You’re probably right. I used to think my high school P.E. teacher didn’t like me but it turned out she liked me a little too much.
283,Leonard,No.
284,Leonard,Great. Now that we’re all on the same page let’s get together tonight and work on it.
285,Leonard,Here’s your tea Mother.
286,Penny,He really needs to dial it down.
287,Sheldon,Neeeeeooooowwwwww!
288,Penny,Okay um oh hey I’m having a party on Saturday so if you guys are around you should come by.
289,Raj,Oh yeah?
290,Sheldon,You said it not me.
291,Leonard,Well have fun with whatever nightmare’s behind door number two.
292,Penny,I don’t care. I’m taking a stand. Metaphorically.
293,Leonard,If we’re going to fight over Missy let’s do it the right way. The honourable way.
295,Leonard,And that’s a lie right?
296,Sheldon,Oh I was having a little trouble sleeping and I just thought uh seeing as you’re up we could talk.
297,Howard,Penny is wearing the worst Catwoman costume I have ever seen and that includes Halle Berry’s.
298,Sheldon,I possess the DNA of Leonard Nimoy?!
299,Sheldon,I don’t think there’s anything in this jewellery store that Amy would appreciate more than the humidifier we were just looking at at Sears.
300,Sheldon,Yeah like a bunch of savages.
301,Leonard,Oh glad you’re here uh sit down I’ll get you a plate. Mom you remember Penny.
302,Penny,Well it’s a chance you have to take. I mean look if it’s meant to be it’ll be.
303,Raj,But he’s afraid of dogs.
304,Raj,It means I like women as well as their skincare products.
305,Penny,Yeah bye sweetie.
306,Raj,I don’t get it. You had a great time.
307,Raj,Fine. Paint green flames on your little scooter with her. 
308,Sheldon,What are you suggesting?
309,Raj,Oh Lucy you don’t have to answer that. Don’t put her on the spot. She hates that. Am I right? Tell her how much you hate being put on the spot. Go ahead tell her.
310,Penny,I don’t know.
311,Penny,Interesting. I usually just have coffee. You’ve been up all night?
312,Leonard,Guys in 30 seconds we went from let’s change the world to let’s watch TV.
313,Raj,Oh yeah like you have a shot with Zac Ephron.
314,Penny,You’re right. Just forget it.
315,Penny,Okay. What if I got him to apologize and promise to behave?
316,Leonard,Hi Kurt.
317,Sheldon,Pattern is the same as fermions travels on the pathways hexagonal it’s always hexagonal…
318,Leonard,Very good thanks for asking. Come on in.
319,Leonard,What?
320,Sheldon,Yeah I’m familiar with your work. C-minus was your gift.
321,Penny,No thank you.
322,Sheldon,You see what happens when you let girls play D&D?
323,Sheldon,Huh. Seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through for intercourse. Don’t you have access to women who will do it for money? By the way another accepted usage for the term ho.
324,Sheldon,I do.
326,Sheldon,Well you didn’t suggest a beach house.
327,Howard,Miss.
328,Penny,Good move telling Sheldon.
329,Howard,Okay I know what I’m going to do.
330,Penny,Do I have a choice?
331,Howard,Well obviously you don’t remember your circumcision.
332,Leonard,And his tight little pants that somehow did not make him sterile.
333,Penny,No he was some kind of scientist let me start again. Oh hey Leonard.
334,Leonard,Then I guess congratulations are in order.
335,Leonard,Thank you.
336,Sheldon,Dr Gablehauser.
337,Leonard,Thank you. What did she mean she’s happy for me? Is she happy because I’m seeing someone or is she happy because she thinks that I’m happy because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy. You know because the second person though happy is now romantically unavailable to the first person.
338,Leonard,Yeah just back there.
339,Leonard,What did I do now?
340,Sheldon,So Bernadette if I express interest in your baby will you promise not to make me touch it?
341,Sheldon,We were really hitting it off.
342,Sheldon,Don’t beat around the bush Leonard. If you don’t want me here just say the word and I’ll leave.
343,Leonard,Maybe along the z-axis but x and y are looking pretty sad.
344,Leonard,How?
345,Sheldon,No you didn’t. But keep in mind I felt extremely important.
346,Leonard,Some psychologists perform operant conditioning with punishment. Maybe we can come up with a punishment for straying off topic.
347,Leonard,You’re not a lawyer Sheldon you’re just a know-it-all.
348,Leonard,I really like you but I want to see how things go with Mark?
349,Sheldon,So have these two and they’re having dinner with us.
350,Raj,What happened?
351,Sheldon,She is. But when do they get to the part about streetcars?
352,Leonard,Is it about the failing state of my relationship with Penny?
353,Leonard,Yeah?
354,Sheldon,Was that sarcasm?
355,Sheldon,What are you crazy? I’m on a unicycle.
356,Leonard,Okay I’ll be right in.
357,Penny,Oh.
358,Penny,Um I don’t know I don’t think a lot.
359,Howard,Really?
360,Sheldon,When there was no more room in the floor safe.
361,Raj,Alright this goes without saying but I’m just going to say it anyway. Hands off my sister.
362,Raj,Knock yourself out.
363,Howard,Of course but it’s all Indian food. You can’t find a bagel in Mumbai to save your life. Schmear me.
364,Howard,No you didn’t. I did.
365,Penny,Yeah. You tell him babe.
366,Sheldon,All right that’s it. Strike three.
367,Sheldon,Is that why you didn’t cover our escape and let us get cut down like animals?
368,Howard,Oh please. Look in the mirror. You both look ten years older than I do.
369,Leonard,This is ridiculous I’m jumping in.
370,Sheldon,Why would I do that?
371,Howard,It is. If you like wandering around a big empty house with no one to love you.
372,Penny,That wasn’t a long hug.
373,Howard,Can I ask you guys a question? So I’m seeing Lucy tomorrow night and I’ve never hung out with someone who broke up with me. How do you do it?
374,Raj,No Stuart picked out those throw pillows all on his own.
375,Sheldon,When the serpent slithers to an opposing player’s piece that piece is considered poisoned and will die after two more moves. Ugh.
376,Leonard,Oh right sure. I wish you could stay in LA a while longer.
377,Howard,Shut your ass!
378,Penny,All right let’s just say we’ve warmed up.
379,Howard,Hey uh Sheldon you want anything?
380,Howard,Sorry. I I just…
381,Penny,I told her to be true to herself and do what makes her happy.
382,Leonard,Uh-huh.
383,Howard,That’s ’cause we’re the good guys.
384,Raj,Hey guys guess who I found at LAX. My baby sister Priya.
385,Raj,Oh yeah? Can you do this? 
386,Leonard,Let me guess you have a problem with this.
387,Raj,Screw you. That was a beautifully written penis metaphor.
388,Leonard,Hang on.  You might be from Texas but I’m from New Jersey.
389,Sheldon,Bye.
390,Sheldon,I’m back down to nine friends. Make it eight I’m sick of Wolowitz too.
391,Leonard,What is Pink Cheeks?
392,Raj,Alright this goes without saying but I’m just going to say it anyway. Hands off my sister.
393,Leonard,It’s Darth Vader shampoo.  Luke Skywalker’s the conditioner.
394,Howard,Okay just to be clear roller skating was my idea and I’m very unhappy that you turned it into a double date and I hope you both fall on your asses and break your coccyxes.
395,Sheldon,Yes?  Did you forget your key?
396,Sheldon,Fine.
397,Leonard,Well…
398,Leonard,That was really intense.
399,Sheldon,What’s up? I’ll tell you what’s up. I’m in a crisis situation and I need you to marshal your powers of concentration limited as they may be…
400,Raj,Hey so what was Adam West like on the phone?
401,Sheldon,Way ahead of you that’s an “I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter” stick.
402,Leonard,Sheldon it’s not that bad.
404,Howard,You mean so it doesn’t hit the fan?
405,Sheldon,Yep I’m on it. Hey look at that an Indian guy outsourcing a computer job to a white fella.
406,Leonard,I’ve never played that before.
407,Leonard,Our pleasure.
408,Leonard,It’s a snowflake. From the North Pole.
409,Leonard,Well this is nice. We don’t have a lot of company over.
410,Leonard,Before I come in you should know I have gas. 
411,Sheldon,If you ask me this whole thing is a waste of our time.
412,Penny,Do you know what that means?
413,Sheldon,That’s your problem. You can’t be alone.
414,Leonard,Is that a retinal scanner?
415,Penny,No just mail no benefits.
416,Howard,Me too.
417,Leonard,Hey.
418,Raj,I don’t know. Maybe ’cause dark doesn’t show the stains?
419,Howard,I mean come on look at you. You’re classically handsome you’ve got a swimmer’s body. Next to you I look like me.
420,Sheldon,Oh no me as well. Uh please e-mail it to Sheldon at bazinga dot biz. Why dot biz? Because I just gave you the business. And also bazinga dot com was taken.
421,Leonard,Snipe.
422,Howard,I just got chills.
423,Leonard,You know what I’m so tired I can’t even think straight. I’m going home. Will one of you guys give this nutbag a ride back later?
424,Penny,What? You were all going as the Hulk?
425,Sheldon,She’s gonna hate the panels.
426,Penny,So what that’s it? You’ve stayed with Sheldon all this time because he kept you from going to federal prison?
427,Sheldon,I beg to disagree. “A girlfriend shall be deemed quote living with un-quote Leonard when she has stayed over for A ten consecutive nights or B more than nine nights in three week period or C all the weekends of a given month plus three weeknights.
428,Sheldon,Mm-hmm.
429,Howard,Tell her it doesn’t matter. Tell her her eyes shimmer like opalescent lilies in the lake of the palace of the celestial maidens.
430,Sheldon,We should get to work.
431,Sheldon,When I’ve seen two consecutive negative throat cultures spaced 12 hours apart. You know the drill. All right if you’ll excuse me I am off to start a prophylactic course of antibiotics.
432,Sheldon,Now that will not be in this week’s e-mail blast.
433,Leonard,Do whatever you want.
434,Penny,What? I don’t know. It doesn’t matter.
435,Raj,Okay. I’ll leave. But just know every time I come in here I’ll be thinking of you.
436,Sheldon,Morning Professor Stevens. Don’t look at that whiteboard. That’s my math not your math. Keep walking nosey.
437,Howard,Oh they only have Thursday and Sunday passes left.
438,Howard,Ugh let’s get this over with.
439,Sheldon,Oh there it is tacos.
440,Penny,Oh I’m gonna miss you.  See you later.
441,Sheldon,All right now before you enter my bedroom unescorted I need you to understand that this onetime grant of access does not create a permanent easement. Easement. It’s a legal right
442,Leonard,Let it fly.
443,Leonard,Night. Attaboy Hofstadter. Nothing gets the ladies hotter than software development analogies. Hey I’m back.
444,Leonard,Yeah buddy?
445,Sheldon,I sense that you’re trying to slow-walk me to an epiphany. Would you mind very much jumping to it?
446,Sheldon,I believe that you’re capable of great change. Like when I finally got you to stop saying Valentimes Day.
447,Howard,I’ve got some feelers out. In the meantime listen to this.
448,Sheldon,I trusted you with my email address and you betrayed that trust by sending me Internet banality strike one. Touching my food strike two.
449,Penny,Well it creeps me out.
450,Penny,I was kind of hoping you would.
451,Raj,It’s nice to think that you grew up in this room and now your daughter’s going to as well.
452,Sheldon, Yes.
453,Sheldon,I am Sheldor of Azeroth. I want my things back.
454,Sheldon,I’d love to help you out but unfortunately  I’m using it.
455,Sheldon,I said the truth. You don’t want to live with Leonard and you know it.
456,Leonard,You mean are you talking gaming marathon?
457,Leonard,So one of my favourite video games of all time is called Shadow of the Colossus and it was only for PlayStation 2 but then they came out with a new version for PS3 with better graphics. I finally got the chance to play it and for some reason it just wasn’t as good as the first one. Or something about yoga.
458,Sheldon,That I have coitus with her.
459,Penny,So Sheldon have you talked to Amy?
460,Sheldon,That’s a big step.
461,Sheldon,Hello.
462,Leonard,Oh uh from the context we think it means kill me now.
463,Sheldon,The key is hidden in my room.
464,Raj,No I was just thinking about Jurassic World. Boy that was terrible.
465,Sheldon,Leonard a moment.
466,Raj,That’s how much we’re gonna melt people’s faces off.
467,Penny,Whoa whoa whoa. Why don’t you just admit you don’t want to be on a team with me.
468,Raj,I forbid it.
469,Sheldon,Oh good you’re home. I need you to do me a favour.
470,Sheldon,Good. There there was really all I had.
471,Penny,Good. I’m glad.
472,Raj,Uh yeah last night. He kept making me drop pencils for him. I got uncomfortable.  che-ee-ee-ese.
473,Raj,Here you go. I’ve got everything we’ll need for the big game. Low fat turkey jerky low-carb beer 100-calorie snack packs.
474,Penny,Sheldon did you draft the contract?
475,Raj,Okay. Oh how about this? Stuart’s dressed like a brother of the Night’s Watch and they don’t have sex.
476,Sheldon,It’s what we think caused your narcissistic personality disorder. We discussed it at length during our last video chat. Although how we got onto the subject of you is baffling.
477,Leonard,Oh hey.
478,Sheldon,What did I do?
479,Sheldon,But I came to file a complaint. Somebody has made me feel uncomfortable in the workplace by using language of an inappropriate and sexual nature.
480,Sheldon,Oh you caught that did you?
481,Sheldon,Arthur?
482,Penny,Really? This one?
483,Sheldon,Oh nice job man-hands.
484,Penny,I think the message is check out the rack on that scientist.
485,Raj,Answering the question once and for all why Wolowitz bailed out of medical school.
486,Leonard,I did.
487,Leonard,You’re not helping.
488,Raj,Don’t be silly. Just tell him.
490,Howard,I can’t wait to ask Stan Lee why he insists on giving all his characters first and last names that start with the same letter.
491,Sheldon,Hold on I have something for you.
492,Leonard,Good night.
493,Leonard,I think what he’s trying to say is that maybe in high school you picked on me a little bit.
494,Leonard,Yeah? What are you keeping?
495,Howard,Maybe you could run some computer simulations.
496,Sheldon,Rajesh.
497,Sheldon,No throwing no catching no running.
498,Penny,You mean like a date?
499,Sheldon,Well my mother’s been there for every honour I’ve won since I beat out my twin sister for the did it on the potty trophy. How does this look?
500,Sheldon,All right then. You should take a third train where you audition for the movie but hold off on making a career decision until you have more information.
501,Penny,Yeah lying isn’t my favourite part of the job. Actually I’m not crazy about a lot of it.
502,Penny,Oh my…
503,Sheldon,Hang on Penny. How about fans here and here?
504,Howard,Great idea. I haven’t had a carbohydrate in two weeks. These cheekbones need to be in front of a camera before I eat a pretzel and they’re gone.
505,Raj,I love you Penny.
506,Leonard,If you’re trying to make me feel better it’s not working.
507,Sheldon,No that’s my potty training journal.
508,Raj,Well that’s just Batman.
509,Raj,Okay.
510,Sheldon,No sir. He did try to give me one for my high school graduation but I was 11 and my mom said no.
511,Sheldon,Oh my. I’ve admired these for years.
512,Sheldon,AFK. I’m playing Age of Conan an online multiplayer game set in the universe of Robert E. Howard’s Conan the Barbarian.
513,Penny,Okay it’s not gonna say that.
514,Sheldon,When I was a little boy and got sick which was most of the time my mother would read it to me. It’s about an Indian princess who befriends a monkey who was mocked by all the other monkeys because he was different. For some reason I related to it quite strongly.
515,Leonard,Yeah sorry.
516,Sheldon,Then suffer in silence. Play. Play. Play.  Stephen Hawking.
517,Sheldon,What? Excuse me you have Dr. Sheldon Cooper in your lab. You’re gonna make him do the dishes? That’s like asking the Incredible Hulk to open a pickle jar.
518,Howard,It’s not so bad really. At least these trains have modern plumbing. In India you squat over a hole in the train and expose your naked buttocks to the chilly air of Rajasthan.
519,Penny,No. No no no. I think the cookie thing.
520,Raj,You’re right I should finish the game. I take my plus-one long sword stab myself in the face with it. I’m dead I’ve got a date with a girl. Bye.
521,Howard,It’s okay. I can’t get mad at your feelings.
522,Raj,God you never listen.
523,Raj,Guys I’m not living in a garage.
524,Sheldon,You know I just put that in because of uterus stuff.
525,Penny,Can we talk?
526,Raj,Oh oh don’t get me wrong nothing happened with me and Howard. There was about 200 pounds of Sailor Moon between us.
527,Leonard,Yes.
528,Sheldon,She can’t shoot me. She’s dead.
529,Penny,You can’t be this proud.
530,Raj,Amy told me you were concerned that I might be too passive and shy. Let me ask you something. Would a passive guy barge in here to look you in the eye and say hey dew-kissed flower what’s up?
531,Sheldon,Yes which is why no one else will ask him to sign one and I will be the possessor of a unique albeit confusing artifact which will set me apart from the hoi polloi of comic book fandom.
532,Leonard,Sheldon he obviously had feelings for her.
533,Sheldon,I don’t drive.
534,Leonard,Thank you Barry.
535,Leonard,Uh yeah.
536,Penny,Oh yeah.
537,Sheldon,This is such a relief. Honestly if it didn’t get you all worked up I’d kiss you right now.
538,Sheldon,That wasn’t sarcasm?
539,Leonard,What?
540,Sheldon,I don’t think that will be necessary for Mr. James Earl Jones. You heard me. The voice of Darth Vader the Lion King’s dad and FYI the guy who says This is CNN. Which also sounds like Darth Vader.
541,Sheldon,Well of course you have a choice. Although we live in a deterministic universe each individual has free will. Now sit down. I call your attention to the events of November 16. Do you remember that date?
542,Raj,But you’re not Princess Punchali.
543,Sheldon,Oh. You said I’m not using my space so I’m using it.
544,Penny,Okay that that’s a good start but I was thinking maybe something a little more personal.
545,Leonard,Honestly?
546,Penny,This plasma grenade.  Ha! Look it’s raining you!
547,Sheldon,Waitresses don’t yell at you at Big Boy.
548,Raj,Hello?
549,Leonard,Here’s Spock’s head with no body. Here’s Mr. T’s body with no head. Oh yeah here’s Spock’s body with Mr. T’s head. I pity the fool who’s illogical.
550,Sheldon,Oh there’s no need to interact with me. I’m just here to observe.
551,Leonard,Gee Penny thanks for buying us dinner.
552,Penny,You know when Leonard’s feeling anxious I make him take a long walk.
553,Penny,Leonard are you okay.
554,Leonard,Okay. Speaking of what the heart wants um a long time ago I made a pact with Wolowitz that kind of involves you.
555,Penny,What?
556,Raj,So you’re wandering all around by yourself? That’s not the kind of hero’s welcome an astronaut should come home to.
557,Sheldon,I’m surprised you struck out with Penny. Apparently she’s a big old five.
558,Penny,It’s called an evening look. I’ve never been to New Jersey before.
559,Howard,Hey I let you peel the plastic don’t get greedy.  Hello?
560,Leonard,The blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial?
561,Howard,Oh is Cinnamon gonna be okay?
562,Sheldon,Wait. Whoa whoa. Is placed right?
563,Leonard,Penny I’ve always known I loved you but this last year has shown me that I also love being married to you. Thank you for saying yes.
564,Howard,How can I meet someone new when everywhere I look I see Lucy’s face? Tell me you don’t see her smile in the crust of this chicken pot pie.
565,Leonard,Hey baby. I love you! Mwuh mwuh mwuh mwuh mwuh.
566,Penny,Yeah but it doesn’t really answer my question.
567,Sheldon,That was a lovely toast. Kudos.
568,Raj,Oh Ooh maybe we could get one of those party buses to take us there.
569,Leonard,Interesting you should lead with that.
570,Howard,What? What are you talking about?
571,Penny,I did not have sex with 31 guys.
572,Sheldon,If you do that I’ll scream.
573,Penny,Yes.
574,Howard,What do I have to be happy about? My life’s a wreck.
575,Leonard,Sheldon.
576,Raj,He’s got to be doing this on purpose.
577,Howard,Then again he did think you were my husband.
578,Leonard,Why did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?
579,Raj,You know you don’t worry about money. I’ll take care of everything.
580,Sheldon,Yes. She’s like the dryer sheets of my heart. I have to go.
581,Penny,It’s good to stretch your muscles before you run.
582,Sheldon,It’s in her book Needy Baby Greedy Baby.
583,Leonard,Did not.
584,Leonard,That would be more helpful if E.T. were real.
585,Sheldon,Uh just out of curiosity why didn’t you ask Leonard for advice about this?
586,Sheldon,Oh dearnot not the dirt people!
587,Penny,Well the girl they picked to play Mimi she dropped out and they asked me to replace her.
588,Leonard,H-h-h-hang on Howard. Barry how good of a shot are you?
589,Leonard,I won’t be too late. I’m just gonna make a final pitch for the funding and then say good night.
590,Sheldon,I believe I do.
591,Howard,No. It’s my fault. You know I finally found someone who was right for me and I I drove her away.
592,Raj,Hey look at this. 20 people from the university have already signed up for our private beta.
593,Sheldon,Yes. I need to prepare her now to save her from pain down the road.
594,Sheldon,All right then. Thank you Howard. Please let Professor Hawking know that I’m available at his earliest convenience.
595,Howard,Well if you like dry factual statements interspersed with painful moments of silence it was bananas.
596,Leonard,Hey Leslie.
597,Leonard,I’ll see what I can do.
598,Sheldon,Good news gentlemen I have tentatively accepted…
599,Leonard,What?
600,Howard,That’s how we missed it.
601,Leonard,That was part of it. The other part is what happened with the elevator.
602,Leonard,Sheldon come on. It’s getting late. Time to go.
603,Leonard,I would like to keep the official flag of our apartment.
604,Sheldon,Underworld guardian. We skirmish to the death.
605,Leonard,I prefer to think of myself as five-ten but I still need to get all my pants hemmed.
606,Sheldon,Excellent. Go on.
607,Penny,Okay. Just for the record I have never entered a wet T-shirt contest. I’ve won a few but that’s just because I spill when I’m drunk so…
608,Sheldon,Hmm?
609,Leonard,And you found somebody you could push around?
610,Penny,What does that mean?
611,Howard,Check it! Howard pulls one out from under the bridge. Nice!
612,Leonard,Who do you think told Koothrappali to go to human resources?
613,Sheldon,Yes.
614,Howard,Sheldon?
615,Howard,Did you start waxing?
616,Leonard,Wait I only initialed it because I never thought it would happen! I initialed another clause naming you my sidekick in case I get superpowers.
617,Raj,Nope I think mocking you is more fun.
618,Penny,No.
619,Sheldon,That’s your opinion.
620,Leonard,Now?
621,Penny,Well so how does it work?
622,Howard,Well I know how you feel. I tried one of those electronic Japanese toilets practically shot myself across the room.
623,Howard,Well it’s not the balls-to-the-wall action of badminton or cricket but hey what is?
624,Howard,Oh boy. Breakfast.
625,Leonard,I’m sorry I’ll start again.
626,Raj,No it’s not. I haven’t had a drink since last night.
627,Sheldon,Luckily for you she could have you beheaded.
628,Howard,Me either.
629,Leonard,Thank you officer.
630,Howard,I was humiliated by yet another woman.
631,Leonard,I had a great idea. You know how we’re always having to stop and solve differential equations like when you’re doing Fourier analysis or using the Schrodinger equation?
632,Howard,You’ve never snooped around my apartment?
633,Sheldon,Did you meet anyone interesting there perhaps a promiscuous redheaded barmaid?
634,Raj,Why is the key always confidence? How come it’s never love handles and flop sweat?
635,Raj,If my fingers ever work again I’ve got a job for the middle one.
636,Leonard,Yeah no. But Sheldon without your insight and leadership this entire enterprise will surely fail.
637,Leonard,You miss the blanket now don’t you?
638,Leonard,Okay Mom let’s get you back to your hotel before anyone says anything else.
639,Sheldon,In order to take a vacation one first has to work.
640,Leonard,Uh we’re on our way to the comic book store.
641,Sheldon,Fine. If you insist on making me a part of this yes I knowledge how painful they can be. However pain has an evolutionary purpose. It provides information from the environment that uh behaviour isn’t good for us.
642,Howard,Fo’ shizzle.
643,Sheldon,I wish I never tried that device. And I know I said the same thing after the massage chair but this time I mean it.
644,Sheldon,Really? Of those two explanations which one seems the most likely?
645,Penny,Oh great. Everything’s good.
646,Raj,You know if I wanted to spend my Saturday nights doing this I could have stayed in India.
647,Penny,Oh hey Leonard. Ooh are you okay?
648,Sheldon,We scored. I’m the wingman.
649,Leonard,Thermal? ‘Cause it’s gonna be cold.
650,Leonard,Whatcha doing?
651,Raj,Well and I ate all the crumb cake. We both made mistakes.
652,Leonard,What are you gonna do? She wanted to see churches.
653,Raj,Well thanks Bernadette. And just for the record labradoodles are hypo-allergenic which is a very sexy quality to those troubled by animal dander.
654,Howard,Hey guys guess who I found at LAX. My baby sister Priya.
655,Leonard,Yeah I like this one.
656,Howard,Interesting. Are you a Droid?
657,Sheldon,Well she could have said goodbye.
658,Penny,I know right? Watch this. Molecules.
660,Sheldon,No I was wrong. The looming threat of being crushed under a pile of lumber does add a certain spice. I’ve never felt so alive.  Oh hello Alex. Uh let me go get you last night’s recordings.
662,Howard,Oh please. My sister’s much hotter than your girlfriend and you know it.
663,Leonard,Did you just quote Star Wars?
664,Sheldon,Let’s see today’s Thursday. Thursday nights I eat pizza from Giacomo’s. Sausage mushrooms light olives.
665,Raj,You know downward-facing dog comes from the Sanskrit phrase adho mukha shvanasana.
666,Sheldon,Wait wait now hang on. You think he manipulates me?
667,Sheldon,No. Crazy was leaving the projection booth unattended.
668,Sheldon,You can always watch the panels online. Oh boy we do say that a lot.
670,Sheldon,I said what are you doing here?
671,Leonard,Yep. You know what? That was pretty crappy of you. I mean all I wanted to do was give you a great night and it’s like you-you went out of your way to destroy it.
672,Sheldon,Yes.
673,Leonard,Still digging the Shamy?
675,Penny,No no. No need to apologise.
676,Raj,You really think so?
677,Raj,Don’t feel bad Leonard negative results are still results.
678,Leonard,Well most of Saturday’s gonna be figuring out where to put this game when we’re done. How about you?
679,Penny,Oh damn it we should have brought binoculars.
680,Penny,I don’t care. Ask her things like are you going to take Howard’s name? Not who’s going to sit on who?
681,Sheldon,Oh while you do that I am going to pump cerebral spinal fluid through my brain cells to remove the metabolic by-products of the day’s thoughts.
682,Penny,Yeah but why are you doing it on the stairs?
683,Leonard,And now you’re also an astronaut.
684,Leonard,No it’s about Penny.
685,Penny,Okay forget the chicken.
686,Howard,No! Not enchanted bunny!
688,Leonard,Just so I know would you be open to taking his class? You can do it online!
689,Raj,Dude that’s incredible!
690,Leonard,I understand that we’re under contract and I don’t know what the consequences of violating that are but uh we’re not gonna be able to deliver in the time we promised.
693,Sheldon,This is a simulation. We have to survive on the supplies we brought.
694,Howard,No kidding. You didn’t make it easy to find. I spent hours digging around online. For the record you have excellent credit scores. And your diabetic aunt seems to be adjusting to her new leg just fine.
695,Leonard,Is that nice?
696,Penny,Oh come on Amy.
697,Leonard,You don’t know that. I’ve been going to the Cheesecake Factory for years. I could have picked her up. 
698,Penny,Oh man.
699,Penny,No the heat of the moment is ooh yeah just like that not will you marry me?
700,Leonard,And she likes you.
701,Leonard,Okay well good luck with it.
702,Leonard,I am.
703,Sheldon,I know. This isn’t the printout. This is my real face.
704,Howard,Well what are we waiting for? Let’s bounce bitches.
705,Sheldon,Okay what do we start with? Maybe splicing some genes clone a sheep perhaps grow a human ear on a mouse’s back? Ha-ha I’m a freak!
706,Sheldon,What hope do I have for establishing new relationships given that my current friends apparently cannot take a few hours out of their lives to help me?
707,Sheldon,Doesn’t matter. This is no way to make new humans. People coming out of people. It’s some kind of dirty magic show.
708,Leonard,Oh uh we’re making nano vacuum tubes.
709,Sheldon, Penny…
710,Raj,Oh I’m sorry is that politically incorrect? In India we just call them untouchables.
711,Penny,Don’t be surprised if you find five chocolates missing and three gross coconut ones with a bite taken out. It came that way when I bought it.
712,Penny,Yup. Be right there. I assume you don’t want wine.
713,Leonard,Yeah no I’m fine. It’s good it’s a good party thanks for having us it’s just getting a little late so….
714,Penny,We can but the part of Penny might get cut.
715,Leonard,That’s great.
716,Howard,Really? I’m sorry. I swear I know other words.
717,Penny,Remember the old days when I would’ve said something dumb like why? Uh that doesn’t sound good.
718,Leonard,Are we overthinking this?
719,Penny,Good morning. You want to go to the pool? Come on you said it yourself only nerds and losers stay in the room. Wow it’s bright out. Isn’t it bright? I should probably close these curtains. Nah. Bye.
720,Penny,The word is popular.
721,Penny,Ooh are these real diamonds?
722,Sheldon,Yeah well of course I do. Listen to it. It’s like an earful of melted caramel.
723,Sheldon,Yeah but exactly who are these people? What are their credentials how are they qualified what makes accidentally noticing a hunk of rock that’s been traipsing around the solar system for billions of years more noteworthy than any other scientific accomplishment made by someone under thirty?
724,Leonard,You know I was thinking there are some great research facilities in India.
725,Leonard,See if you can get a table by the window.
726,Leonard,What do you guys want to do tonight?
727,Penny,Oh. Hello. I I didn’t know he was gonna point it at me so don’t do drugs and stay in school.
728,Sheldon,I’m fine.
729,Sheldon,He’s trying to kill me Leonard. Video games and rock music have desensitized him to violence.
730,Leonard,No no no. This is not a fight. I was just excited that someone offered you a part and a little surprised that you’d rather sit at home and do nothing than take it. Now it’s a fight.
731,Penny,I did still a mess.
732,Sheldon,Also you’re tasked with bringing home all takeout dinners. Tonight is Thai food. You’ll find the standard order in appendix B or downloadable from my FTP server. If you have any questions here’s the FAQ sheet or if you prefer the human touch I do a live web chat called Apartment Talk on Tuesday nights.
734,Sheldon,Are you saying that I’m forbidden from applying a harmless scientifically valid protocol that will make our lives better?
735,Penny,Leonard?
736,Howard,I had a great time last night.
737,Leonard,It never is is it?
738,Howard,I saw what you did there.
739,Penny,Come on someone insulted your girlfriend and you just let him do it. I thought you Texas guys stood up for your womenfolk.
740,Sheldon,In what words then exactly
741,Leonard,Oh! I didn’t even think of that. Thanks.
742,Sheldon,Wow. I don’t know which hurts worse my nose or my heart. Well I’m done speaking to you.
743,Sheldon,That is true. Did you know I figured out in which order I would eat all my friends in the event of an apocalypse?
744,Leonard,Okay listen to me this is just a minor setback.
745,Leonard,Maybe we should give them some privacy.
746,Leonard,No need to. As soon as she flies into California airspace I’ll feel a disturbance in the Force.
747,Sheldon,That depends. Does square-dancing with my sister at a Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown count as a date?
748,Penny,Hello.
749,Sheldon,To paraphrase T.S. Eliot this is the way the world ends not with a bang but with a nephew.
750,Penny,Yeah me too. Um good night.  Leonard?
751,Leonard,It certainly is.
752,Howard,Oh God.
753,Sheldon,Fine. I’m nothing if not adaptable.
754,Leonard,Hang on why do we have to hate it?
755,Penny,You had sex didn’t you?
756,Raj,Come on in.
757,Sheldon,So I’ve decided I’m going to collaborate with you.
758,Sheldon,I want more than a picture. I want to go in.
759,Howard,Uh my plans with Priya.
760,Raj,Well I choose love.
761,Sheldon,Yes we did my friend.
762,Penny,Sheldon sweetie shut up.
764,Howard,Oh. It’s wonderful and I swear I’m not saying that because Justin Timberlake is in it.
765,Howard,I was when I came in but it’s amazing what liquor does to guilt. Besides what you might not know is Bernadette is planning on breaking up with Howard.
766,Sheldon,I think I left my pen in there.
767,Leonard,No that can’t be right.
768,Howard,Let’s see what else can I tell you about me that would make you like me? Ooh I love music. Do you love music?
769,Leonard,Oh God.
770,Sheldon,It’s worth noting that he died of syphilis.
771,Raj,Not Brian Boitano that’s for sure. How’s your burrito?
772,Leonard,What about  Cookies!
773,Leonard,Wait a minute. He offered to send you to the North Pole?
774,Howard,I don’t care! And why don’t you think I can find a woman for myself?
775,Howard,He’s in Texas he’ll never know.
776,Raj,I was humiliated by yet another woman.
777,Penny,Doesn’t matter. Prom is silly anyways.
778,Raj,You have a desk.
779,Leonard,I know. You think people are gonna be mad?
780,Sheldon,Get out!
781,Sheldon,Go ahead. I have no illusions about my mother. She is a kind loving religiously fanatical right-wing Texan with a slightly out-of-scale head and a mild Dr. Pepper addiction. Anything you’d like to add?
782,Leonard,Should I um leave you two alone?
783,Leonard,Thank you.
784,Leonard,No we’re kind of taking it slow.
785,Sheldon,Well then you might want to avoid East Texas.
786,Leonard,Look I’m sorry Raj but the truth is I was with Priya last night.
787,Raj,Thank you.
788,Penny,Well that’s Wilshire’s problem. Come on you know there there’s got to be something fun we could do that the guys will hate.
789,Howard,Maybe moving in was a bad idea. I haven’t been here one day I’m already causing problems.
790,Penny,Sheldon take a break.
791,Howard,Whether you call it God or the universe or the self we’re all interconnected and that’s just a beautiful… Son of a bitch that guy just dinged my car. S seriously? You were just gonna drive away? Like my life isn’t hard enough right now. A space probe might be destroyed my parents are going through an awful divorce the guy who cuts my dog’s hair just gave her bangs.
792,Howard,Got it. Take care. I guess I have no choice but to make sweet guilt-free love to you over and over again for the rest of my life.
793,Raj,Their meatballs are pretty good.
794,Howard,Well I trusted you and you let me down. The poor thing’s been shaking for hours.
795,Leonard,Well you’re you’re right. Let’s just go.
796,Sheldon,I said Good Day! 
797,Raj,Are you listening to this guy?
798,Leonard,Okay not to be pedantic but the last I checked went out was in fact the past tense of going out which I think we all know is a popular euphemism for saw each other naked.
799,Penny,Toy Story 3?
800,Penny,It would take the pressure off.
801,Sheldon,Yes. I’m attending a party this weekend for a 93-year-old woman. Can you recommend a gift?
802,Howard,Well uh how about you keep the store open late and we throw a party for all the people who don’t have dates?
803,Sheldon,What colour would you like to be?
804,Howard,All the wealthy and beautiful people in movies ride Jet Skis. That can’t just be a coincidence.
805,Raj,Of course. Please come in.
806,Sheldon,Oh I hate when that happens.
807,Raj,Before I forget I’d like your opinion on the menus I’ve prepared for the Halloween party. The theme is food that goes bump in the night.
808,Leonard,It’s okay we’ll figure something out.
809,Sheldon,Trust me Kripke will fall easy prey to my psychological warfare. Observe. Kripke! I would ask if your robot is prepared to meet its maker but as you are its maker clearly the two of you have met.
810,Leonard,So?
811,Leonard,What?
812,Howard,No.
813,Howard,It’s all of ours. 
814,Sheldon,How’s this? Pleased to meet you Dr Gablehouser. How fortunate for you that the University has chosen to hire you despite the fact that you’ve done no original research in 25 years and instead have written a series of popular books that reduce the great concepts of science to a series of anecdotes each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration of an average bowel movement. Mahalo.
815,Sheldon,I suppose we could try to make it a celebration but he died so young.
816,Sheldon,What is it?
817,Raj,But you charged me hundreds for this stuff.
818,Penny,And you moved in anyway?
819,Howard,Where?
820,Sheldon,Oh I am. And you realize what the next step is?
821,Raj,You called it.
822,Howard,Howard’s capsule should be re-entering the atmosphere any minute.
823,Sheldon,I have empathy. Watch. Leonard made me soup and I was mean to him.
824,Sheldon,She told you?
825,Penny,Hiney?
826,Sheldon,The first one’s free? Flash how do you stay in business?
827,Sheldon,All of them.
828,Sheldon,Impaired cognitive function.
829,Leonard,You’re kidding. Never worked for me.
830,Sheldon,Thank you. That that was wonderful.
831,Penny,All right standard state fair pie-eating contest rules are no hands first one to clean the pan wins.
832,Penny,Hey.
833,Leonard,Whatever. Can we just get back to this?
834,Leonard,I’m kidding I want you to feel at home here. Decorate it any way that makes you happy.
835,Howard,As much as I appreciate this I can’t accept it okay? Halley’s my goddaughter I don’t take care of her for money.
836,Leonard,Well he came out of his room this morning wearing his Darth Vader helmet and tried to choke me to death with the Force so I’d say a little better.
837,Leonard,Come on this is silly. Hey um I brought you back a little present from my trip huh? It’s that sailor cap that you wanted. It’s neat huh?
838,Penny,Oh sorry. Yeah you’re right. Doy. So Howard trolls yay or nay?
839,Sheldon,As if one of the plants from Invasion of the Body Snatchers duplicated you in every way only with an absurd amount of hair gel.
840,Howard,It’s bigger than the house my grandfather grew up in.
841,Sheldon,What a wonderful idea how does this man not have a Nobel?
842,Sheldon,I didn’t realize I was obligated to share my connection with things you’re a fan of but very well. You enjoy Canadian bacon. I’ve been to Toronto.
843,Sheldon,Sssshhhh! Penny’s sleeping.
844,Sheldon,Thanks. Ooh listen I wouldn’t mind a piece of birthday cake provided the old gal’s candle blow is clean and dry.
845,Howard,Sure. Mmm. Bossa nova. You listen to that with your hips as well as your ears.
846,Leonard,Sheldon gave a lecture at the university tonight. We’re reading the reviews.
847,Howard,She’s clearly having a working lunch and preferred to eat alone.
848,Sheldon,Look I didn’t turn a profit last quarter by taking product off the shelves willy-nilly.
849,Raj,Oh congratulations. You’re the first team to arrive.
850,Sheldon,Come again?
851,Sheldon,Actually I don’t need that. I hacked into your e-mail account and read it.
852,Leonard,Fine go ahead.
853,Raj,Don’t put yourself down. You’re a very attractive man.
854,Raj,The only threesome I’ve ever had in my life and I’m proud to say it was with this man right here.
855,Leonard,Okay. I don’t know it’s probably a little late to ask you to make me taller. Oh um if you could help out with me and my girlfriend. She’s all the way in India. That would be great.
856,Penny,All I’m saying is you know Leonard the best.
857,Penny,Yeah th-th-th-that’s what it is so…
858,Leonard,So um I’ve been thinking a lot about you and me and the boat.
859,Howard,I don’t get it.
860,Leonard,It doesn’t?
861,Sheldon,You take it easy! I need to use your shower.
862,Sheldon,Waterfalls. Crashing waves. Babbling brooks.
863,Raj,Yeah okay just do me a favour and stop talking about how great Claire is.
864,Howard,Open wide here comes the happy train.
865,Sheldon,All right. Well given that missing you is predicated on you leaving logic dictates you must leave.
866,Sheldon,Okay fine. Let’s just agree that both creations are special in their own way and it is foolish to try and compare them. Although we didn’t need to have sex with Howard for ours so we win.
867,Howard,I know. I saw the Tweet.
868,Penny,Okay I don’t need your attitude just hold him there a little longer.
869,Howard,Well they weren’t speaking at the time so he had a servant say it to her. Oh maybe I could make a gift for them. I know how much you guys love the coasters I made for you.
870,Howard,I guess it didn’t go well.
871,Sheldon,They went to Catalina for the weekend.
872,Penny,Okay the clue must be in the bag.
873,Penny,You guys just got back together. You might not want to ditch her on her birthday.
874,Howard,It would be nice to have the increased income. Stop taking money from my parents.
875,Penny,Hey guys guys some of the other waitresses wanted me to ask you something.
876,Penny,Well people who are abducted by aliens lose time. I mean maybe it happens to the aliens too.
877,Sheldon,Hello.
878,Howard,Oh Double Stuffed Oreos I remember when I could afford you.
879,Penny,Well I’m sure she didn’t upset you on purpose. Besides aren’t you the one who says there’s nothing more important than the advancement of science?
880,Leonard,What happened?
881,Raj,I just got chills.
882,Raj,If you’re offended let go of the ring and go on home to your mother’s boobies.
883,Sheldon,Aha.
884,Sheldon,In case it comes up again this right here is an imposition.
885,Sheldon,She was late. And she found atomic spectroscopy boring. Well I wouldn’t coitus her with your genitals.
886,Leonard,No way.
887,Howard,You laughed.
888,Leonard,Sounds great.
889,Penny,Leonard?
890,Raj,You know who’s a super-ager? Jennifer Lopez. Like what is her secret?
891,Sheldon,No. I dislike the sound of the harp. Its overuse in classic television sitcoms always makes me think I’m going to experience an episode from my past.  I’m sorry Mommy. Don’t be mad at me. Don’t do that!
892,Penny,It doesn’t matter. I’m not doing it.
893,Howard,I disagree. Penny is a strong independent woman. The more you try to control her the more she’ll push back.
894,Leonard,Where did you hear that?
895,Sheldon,Why would you do that?
896,Howard,For which she awarded him the nickname “speed of light Leonard.”
897,Sheldon,The same thing that happened to Homo Erectus. He was replaced by a superior species.
898,Penny,Oh come on Leonard it’s you. What’s going to happen? I mean even if there was a stripper all you’d do is avoid eye-contact and maybe offer to help her kid with his homework.
899,Sheldon,We seem to be moving on to the annual coitus portion of your birthday festivities.
900,Howard,No it’s just that everybody’s got someone. Sheldon’s with Amy Howard’s getting married you’re dating my sister.
901,Sheldon,Dungeons & Dragons.
902,Raj,Hey.
903,Howard,Or possibly Durham North Carolina.
904,Penny,Hey hey I just found a farm where they let you chop down your own tree.
905,Sheldon,I’ll have the chicken noodle. Goodnight.
906,Howard,Can we please stop talking about my testicles? Sheldon tell them what you did.
907,Penny,Hey Raj!  Still not talking to me huh?
908,Penny,Okay will you relax? You’re not missing anything special.
909,Penny,Okay we were going out. You were going to get sex anyway.
910,Sheldon,I had to leave. They were having fun wrong.
911,Leonard,Relax it wasn’t your fault.
912,Howard,Oh so you are unencumbered?
913,Sheldon,We could. We could also stop using the letter M but I think that idea is isguided and oronic.
914,Leonard,Yeah he didn’t tell it right.
915,Raj,Here.
916,Penny,I said I’ll get to it.
917,Penny,Hi.
918,Sheldon,Thank you.
919,Sheldon, Penny.
920,Leonard,Damn his Vulcan hearing. Not a good time Sheldon.
921,Howard,Oh my God I think you broke my toe!
922,Sheldon,Oh it’s all right. She’ll forgive you. She has to or she goes to hell.
923,Howard,So listen I know we talked about getting a bite to eat in Silver Lake and then seeing the Christmas lights in Griffith Park but Leonard’s talking about a big D and D game at his place.
924,Sheldon,What are you doing?
925,Sheldon,Yeah? Did the guy make sure that this has a one terabyte solid-state drive?
926,Penny,Sure.
927,Leonard,Leave me alone.
928,Raj,You know we’re not that far from Vazquez Rocks.
929,Leonard,Excuse me but you are not the only distinguished scientist in this apartment. I’ve been published in peer-reviewed journals I received a Dissertation of the Year award for experimental particle physics.
930,Leonard,Do anything interesting today?
931,Penny,So how did the talk with Stephanie go?
932,Howard,You’re only making it seem more real for me.
933,Howard,Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!
934,Howard,Okay uh you check for squeaks and I will mark them down.
935,Leonard,I’s the smallest size they had except the one for dogs. I can’t believe they had one for dogs.
936,Sheldon,That’s true. Oh it’s a good thing I had a nap.
937,Howard,Now I’m making sure the telescope’s camera is white-field balanced and wishing you had a colouring book.
938,Penny,Well you’ve lied to Sheldon.
939,Leonard,Seems a shame to throw it away.
940,Leonard,…who’s a friend.
941,Leonard,I’m surprised you wanted to go to a sports bar Sheldon.
942,Sheldon,Have faith gentlemen. We don’t need Wolowitz engineering is merely the slow younger brother of physics. Watch and learn. Do either of you know how to open the toolbox?
943,Sheldon,That’s okay I never understood them anyway.
944,Sheldon,I didn’t. Let’s go.
945,Penny,Milk.
946,Leonard,Ugh. Too much wine.
947,Leonard,Oh no come on. It was a while. It was a while.
948,Leonard,She’s kidding.
949,Sheldon,Yeah. It’s great you’re here. I’d love to get an engineer’s opinion.
951,Leonard,No.
952,Howard,Okay that I said. But that’s a real problem. You give a girl another woman’s bra and you will not be having sex with her that night. Maybe the other girl but not her.
953,Raj,Okay great everybody loves their grandmas! Now come on Sheldon finish him off!
954,Raj,Thank you. I hope she’s half as lovely and amazing as you are.
955,Penny,Oh don’t worry sweetie. No one has.
956,Leonard,All right here goes nothing.
957,Sheldon,He does it all the time. He’s a cornucopia of social awkwardness.
958,Howard,Oh no she’s gonna leave you for someone might as well get it over with.
959,Leonard,Was there a plan B?
960,Raj,You unfriended me? Seriously?
962,Raj,No. It’s too Brobdingnagian.
963,Penny,Yeah you too. Leonard I didn’t know you played the cello?
964,Raj,I bought a parrot.
965,Sheldon,I didn’t know she did.
966,Howard,Hmm. Uh let me see something. 
967,Raj,All right let’s get this over with. Ew it’s got someone’s hair on it.
968,Leonard,Thanks for the heads up.
969,Sheldon,I’ll tell you. I’m from Texas. Need I say more?
970,Leonard,All right now one benefit of quantum coupling…
971,Leonard,How’s your mom holding up?
972,Penny,Yes.
973,Penny,Sheldon!
974,Penny,Well I’m not getting in bed with him.
975,Penny,It’s the same thing.
976,Sheldon,Just wait.
977,Sheldon,You want me to give up string theory for something that’s less advanced? You know why don’t you break up with Penny and start dating a brown bear?
978,Sheldon,Look it’s the same smile she has in the painting.
979,Leonard,So where exactly are we in this relationship?
980,Sheldon,Buda and Pest united to form Budapest. And that’s why Budapest is the Budabest. Now.
982,Leonard,Um anyway apparently it’s okay to go back to people you’re no longer seeing and have recreational sex with them.
983,Sheldon,What exactly do you mean by that?
984,Sheldon,Okay this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity I now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste.
985,Leonard,Well then bed mister.
986,Raj,I’m going to be 30 years old and I have no one in my life to love me. I’m such a basket case I can’t even talk to a woman without having alcohol in my body.
987,Sheldon,We said no tanks.
988,Sheldon,No can’t do it. Sorry Quinto you’re going back.
989,Sheldon,Please Penny as you know I’m not comfortable with prolonged good-byes and maudlin displays of emotion so I prepared a short video.
990,Raj,Yeah before the movie you did 20 minutes on why guacamole turns brown. It turned brown while you were talking.
991,Sheldon,You’re good-naturedly ribbing me aren’t you?
992,Howard,Hey Leonard Sheldon kicked me out of the room gave me your key.
993,Sheldon,My enchanted troll bludgeons your screaming harpy with a cursed mace. Game.
994,Sheldon,In any event that began a decade-long progression of insults pranks and unwanted magazine subscriptions. To this day I still get a monthly copy of Granny on Granny. Which other than its surprisingly fun puzzle page is complete filth.
995,Howard,May the fourth be with you?
996,Sheldon,Hello.
997,Penny,Okay. Let’s go.
998,Sheldon,Fine. Leonard there’s no need for you to pretend to like me anymore.
999,Sheldon,Are you sure? These items represent our shared times together.
1000,Leonard,You were so worried that you smashed your face trying to check on me. You love me.
1001,Howard,He’s hanging in there.
1002,Leonard,See this is the good thing about having a girlfriend 9000 miles away. I can spend my nights doing whatever I want.
1003,Sheldon,For what it’s worth my mother says that when we deceive for personal gain we make Jesus cry.
1004,Sheldon,Now you do too. Oh! I have a brilliant idea. Amy’s a biologist. I’ll go work in her lab.
1005,Sheldon,So they’re both trying to make each other happy and the end result is they make each other sad? That’s hilarious. I can’t wait to tell them.
1006,Leonard,What the hell are you talking about?
1007,Sheldon,You’re just repeating what I said. It’s like living with a lactose-intolerant parrot.
1008,Leonard,Thank you.
1009,Sheldon,I can’t.
1010,Sheldon,When I fail to open this jar and you succeed it will establish you as the alpha male. You see when a female witnesses an exhibition of physical domination she produces the hormone oxytocin. If the two of you then engage in intercourse this will create the biochemical reaction in the brain which lay people naively interpret as falling in love.
1011,Leonard,So boys how was the pyjama party? You guys jump on the bed and sing into hair brushes?
1012,Sheldon,We don’t have Thai food on Thursday. We have pizza on Thursday.
1013,Penny,Yeah.
1014,Sheldon,You tampered with my experiment?
1016,Leonard,What for?
1017,Sheldon,You how can you say that? You show me one thing in here we can live without.
1018,Sheldon,Yes. And I’d thank you to do the same.
1019,Penny,Well what is it?
1020,Raj,Thanks for inviting us over.
1021,Howard,Oh that’s a big deal.
1022,Howard,All right uh forget pulling. How about we get an electric saw and cut it off?
1023,Sheldon,Oh no. It’s not just me. No. The railway is four hours from the nearest airport and guess who gets to drive me.
1024,Leonard,All right. But let me know if you’re going to stuff him with junk food. I don’t want to bring home a nice dinner for him and see it go to waste.
1025,Sheldon,Thank you.
1026,Sheldon,You’re an  actress correct?
1027,Leonard,Terrific. Something weird happened and I don’t know what to do about it.
1028,Sheldon,Did you see The Lake House?
1029,Sheldon,At the bottom.
1030,Sheldon,While I disagree with the premise of tenure if they gave it to me it wouldn’t diminish my output. You know I’m like the sun. Can’t turn this off.
1031,Sheldon,Mango caterpillar. What are you doing? You said you liked it!
1032,Sheldon,Leonard.
1033,Sheldon,Tell him Dr. Cooper feels that the best use of his time is to employ his rare and precious mental faculties to tear the mask off nature and stare at the face of God.
1034,Leonard,Can it wait I need to talk to you.
1035,Howard,Why can’t I find someone? I’m smart I’ve got a cool job and my naturally bronzed complexion means I can pull off mustard yellow in a way most guys can’t.
1036,Sheldon,So what? I don’t issue invitations to your mother.
1037,Leonard,What?
1038,Raj,Fine you want something to do? There’s about six months of data on this hard drive. Why don’t you go through it and see if you can spot any patterns or anomalies.
1039,Raj,And j and just so you know my favourite movie is Princess Bride.
1040,Penny,You’ll never believe what happened to me at work today.
1041,Sheldon,What is that awful smell?
1042,Raj,Yes I’ll take you back.
1043,Sheldon,Isn’t she brilliant Leonard? How I envy you.
1044,Leonard,Look at it. Non-alcoholic beer.
1045,Howard,Look I’m not the kind of guy who drops his friends just because he’s in a relationship.
1046,Leonard,Uh yeah it’s Raj’s sister. It’s kind of tough. She’s in India. Also her parents aren’t happy she’s dating someone white.
1047,Sheldon,As a child I loved Wesley Crusher Wil Wheaton’s character on Star Trek. So I drove for hours by bus to a Star Trek convention at which Wil Wheaton was scheduled to appear so that I could get my Wesley Crusher action figure signed. But he never showed because apparently it was cooler for him to be the lower-left corner on Hollywood Squares. Oh damn! The floppy failed. Well whoever was in charge of quality control at the Verbatim Corporation in 1989 congratulations you just made the list.
1048,Sheldon,Your cell phone was off.
1049,Sheldon,Golly she sounds too good to be true.
1050,Sheldon,And a complete sucker.
1051,Sheldon,Real cocoa?
1052,Penny,Guys guys you’re never gonna believe this.
1053,Penny,Amy wants me to have it.
1054,Leonard,That’s the spirit.
1055,Sheldon,Thank you Amy. Here’s your cat. And here’s your $20.
1056,Penny,Sounds great.
1057,Sheldon,Score one for liquor and poor judgement.
1058,Penny,Fifty cents off Vagisil.
1059,Howard,Really? I’ll do anything.
1060,Leonard,Uh what about that girl last year at Comic-con?
1061,Sheldon,Said Pharoah to Moses.
1062,Leonard,My point is Priya’s gone. And it would be much better if no-one else found out about this.
1063,Howard,A time share time machine? I’m in. Sheldon?
1064,Penny,I don’t know. I only started seeing Zack again so I wouldn’t be alone on New Year’s Eve. How pathetic is that?
1065,Penny,Great.
1066,Sheldon,You’re just saying that to make me feel better.
1067,Sheldon,It went well. Yeah I’ve learned that if you never say you’re sorry the times you do really puts them on their heels. Uh Stuart I relieve you of your line duties.
1068,Leonard,No.
1069,Penny,Really?
1070,Sheldon,Oh hello.
1071,Penny,So did I win or not?
1072,Sheldon,You heard him Leonard. No it’s not racist.
1073,Leonard,Should’ve let Sheldon come.
1074,Leonard,Can we please just go in my chain mail is stuck in my underwear.
1075,Raj,Actually I was just checking my e-mail. But uh no the Rover is not responding.
1076,Raj,Well I am an astrophysicist and a lot of that takes place at night. When there are vampires and miscellaneous undead out and about.
1077,Leonard,All right.
1078,Leonard,I see a problem.
1079,Sheldon,It’s called sleep and it’s my bedtime. Nighty-night y’all.
1080,Sheldon,I can’t tell you.
1081,Leonard,That’s it. Bye-bye. 
1082,Leonard,Yep.
1084,Sheldon,All right without objection the minutes of the previous date are considered read and agreed to. Any new business?
1085,Sheldon,I’m not saying people can’t use tools. Even an otter picks up a rock when he wants a clam.
1087,Raj,No thank you.
1088,Penny,He’ll be okay. You taught him well Padawan.
1089,Sheldon,Why not?
1090,Penny,Okay. Leonard Cool.
1091,Sheldon,But the truth is I can no longer balance a full-time career a popular Internet show and a girlfriend.
1092,Leonard,I have a list. FYI overuse of the phrase oh my god is number 12.
1093,Howard,Yeah no but it is basic human nature. If we present him as a prize maybe they would.
1094,Leonard,What? Hey hey! Come back here!
1095,Leonard,A party?
1096,Leonard,Got it. All right I’m thinking one way to counter bias in the peer-review process is for papers to be submitted under gender-neutral names. Like S. Smith instead of Samantha Smith.
1097,Raj,Of course of course. Now when you say look after you mean…
1098,Howard,She won’t notice they’re missing?
1099,Sheldon,Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo?
1100,Howard,Low self-esteem.
1101,Howard,No. You have to read it how Dr. Angus McDougal of the University of Edinburgh would. This wee li’l bairn of a theory nearly blew me kilt off.
1103,Sheldon,Good. Um the conductor said if I come back to the engine room he’d show me how to bring the train through a crossing.
1104,Leonard,I wasn’t screwing around with anyone.
1105,Leonard,Name one.
1106,Howard,It’ll be okay.
1107,Penny,All right hang on. is this still about your mom’s book?
1108,Penny,Aw that’s nice. Put that on her cake.
1109,Penny,Star Wars?
1110,Howard,I’m curious what part of America is that accent from?
1111,Sheldon,Well I understand there are several types of artificial women. Maybe you should look into that.
1112,Leonard,No problem. Bye. Oh and bye bro! .
1113,Penny,Oh no no I just I said Whee.
1114,Raj,Really because I saw Peter Pan and you’re dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby. She was a little bigger than you but it’s basically the same look man.
1115,Raj,So never.
1116,Sheldon,Unless it gets to the old woman in time in which case she sucks out the poison turning her into the Grand Empress a piece combining the power of the knight queen and serpent.
1117,Sheldon,It’s also my gift to you. That was clear right? ‘Cause you’re not getting anything else.
1118,Penny,Okay I gave this a lot of thought and I finally found something to show you how much I love you.
1119,Raj,There are just some things that I feel more comfortable sharing with the girls because they won’t make fun of me or and call me names or ask me if my Koothrapanties are in a bunch.
1120,Sheldon,Oh so many crazy rules.
1121,Leonard,You’re kidding me. Uh can I see you for a sec over here?
1122,Penny,Well you and I would get our own room right?
1123,Leonard,Maybe you want to give it a rest and try again tomorrow.
1124,Howard,Yeah I was wrong. But I do think you and I would have had a great time.
1125,Sheldon,So you’re never getting married? It’s his whining isn’t it?
1126,Leonard,Bye.
1127,Sheldon,I’m sorry I believe you’ve misunderstood. I’m not giving you the job. I’m simply affording you the opportunity to apply for it. Have a seat we’ll get started with the interview.
1128,Raj,Do you hear how homophobic you sound?
1129,Howard,I did. You said no Bridget Jones.
1130,Sheldon,No Leonard. For years merciless thugs like Kripke have made my life a series of painful noogies and humiliating wedgies and the insensitively named Indian burns. That stops now.
1131,Sheldon,Aren’t you afraid I’ll embarrass you?
1132,Penny,Oh someone’s been shopping at Gucci.
1133,Sheldon,It’s a hypothetical containment field for a Frisbee-sized wormhole that could serve as a portal to a parallel universe.
1134,Leonard,This is ridiculous. I’m going across the hall.
1135,Raj,It’s nice of you to let him keep staying at your mom’s house.
1136,Penny,The what?
1137,Leonard,Does anyone else see the flaw in this plan?
1138,Penny,Thank you Penny Blossoms. These will be perfect to cover my bald spot. Aww that is so sweet.
1139,Leonard,What landing party?
1140,Penny,Fine I’ll go. Hmm. People turn to you for guidance and wisdom. Yeah that’s a good one.
1141,Raj,You should’ve seen your face.
1142,Leonard,Well hang on. Why do you believe that he knows what it is and I don’t?
1143,Raj,You’re a sucky friend you know that? A sucky sucky friend.
1144,Leonard,You’re not gonna need wingman you’re gonna need a paramedic.
1145,Leonard,Well she’s so excited I can’t do that to her.
1146,Sheldon,Oh oh the guy. Oh pardon me. I didn’t realize you’d spoken to the guy. Yeah tell me did the guy choose one with a 4K display and a Thunderbolt port?
1147,Howard,You would do that for me?
1148,Sheldon,Oh stop. And I believe this is yours. FYI if you wear that into a bank they will tackle you to the ground.
1149,Sheldon,That’s the work of noted Hollywood costume designer Deborah Nadoolman. She also designed the iconic red and black jacket in Michael Jackson’s Thriller video which I’ve never viewed in its entirety as I find zombies dancing in choreographed synchronicity implausible. And also it’s really scary.
1150,Leonard,I’m having a panic attack.
1151,Leonard,Oh my cute little tushy strikes again.
1152,Sheldon,All right back to learning.
1153,Sheldon,Dr. Fowler?
1154,Penny,Okay I understand everyone’s a little tense today so I am just gonna get to the important stuff. Leonard standing here with you in front of our family and friends is bringing up a lot of feelings. Like what a good idea it was to elope the first time. But also how incredibly happy you make me. Thank you for marrying me. Hopefully for the last time.
1155,Leonard,Oh great. Dr. Gallo is terrific. You know I I’ve always been insecure that no one cares about what I have to say but she made me see…
1156,Sheldon,Interesting. A few people in the comments section have said that my delivery is robotic. Perhaps that isn’t the compliment it sounds like.
1158,Leonard,Call someone.
1159,Sheldon,No offence but this is pure 100% Nimoy. Because of your mother you’re only 50%. Which isn’t bad but anything that you wipe your mouth on gets thrown away.
1160,Sheldon,You people are sick.
1161,Leonard,Don’t do that.
1162,Raj,You’ve been a sucky friend a sucky sucky friend.
1163,Leonard,Of course. Well hey how about this? Whether we’re friends not friends scattered around the world no matter what let’s all promise to meet in front of this building exactly 20 years from tonight at 800 p.m. and have dinner like we always do.
1164,Leonard,Give me a minute. Sheldon
1165,Penny,Oh you know I also lied about the girl in the bathroom. Yeah we actually dumped her retainer in the toilet and put it back in her mouth.
1166,Howard,Okay. Oh how about this? Stuart’s dressed like a brother of the Night’s Watch and they don’t have sex.
1167,Raj,What?
1168,Sheldon,May I point out to you all that the screening is first come first served?
1169,Sheldon,Maybe they’ll be best friends. One of them is brilliant one is sweet and simple. Sound familiar?
1170,Raj,Oh Howard it’s still our thing. Come with us we’ll we’ll get you a scalped ticket.
1171,Penny,I’ll see if it’s available.
1172,Leonard,Let’s get this over with. Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory or are we having sex? I’m just I’m trying to lighten the mood.
1173,Howard,Well come on we won’t tell anyone.
1174,Howard,I’m looking to make extra money and was wondering if you had any chores I could do.
1175,Sheldon,No but you are so I got you this as a present.
1176,Leonard,Nirsh.
1177,Leonard,Oh I had a good dream that when I carried you to bed I let your head hit the wall and I laughed.
1178,Raj,We are testing a new medication for social anxiety panic attacks agoraphobia and obsessive compulsive disorder. Why would they be looking for test subjects here?
1179,Leonard,Yes. I felt guilty as soon as it happened. I feel guilty every time I see her.
1180,Leonard,Hand me the bat.
1181,Penny,Yeah yeah by some guys in Budapest I’m just not sure it’s the right move for my character.
1182,Howard,What about the guy on the Channel Four News? You know Four on Your Side? Maybe he can be on your side.
1183,Leonard,It’s not a date and that’s racist.
1184,Sheldon,Hello.
1185,Leonard,Okay fine I betrayed Howard.
1186,Raj,Anyway uh as I was saying I was at a pretty low place in my life and uh if it wasn’t for friends
1187,Penny,I got nothing.
1188,Sheldon,You know I liked it better when there was still a little mystery left in our relationship.
1189,Penny,I Hope Alex Gets Crabs The Movie.
1190,Penny,Sheldon honey did you ever consider making friends by being I don’t know pleasant?
1191,Penny,But I realize they’re gluing fur everywhere except my cleavage. So I asked the director why and he says it’s important to the story that my boobs be the last things to turn ape.
1192,Sheldon,Oh got it. We order a pizza.
1193,Leonard,Yeah I forgot about all this.
1194,Howard,Well you’ve probably never had to do this stuff ’cause you’re young and beautiful and men have always thrown themselves at you.
1195,Leonard,She fixed your equation.
1196,Leonard,Yeah. Although…
1197,Sheldon,Okay well I am sorry. I’m just worried that my sensitivity to temperature could make this a rough night. And no offence but your bottom radiates enough heat I’m surprised there aren’t iguanas lying on it.
1198,Howard,What if we reposition the collection tank?
1199,Howard,You’re paying? Have you been selling your sperm again?
1200,Howard,They’re here. Our action figures have arrived. This is the best five hundred dollars I’ve ever spent.
1201,Sheldon,I didn’t hog anything. Unlike you and that weird lasagna with raisins in it.
1202,Leonard,Terrific does anyone want to buy my share of the time machine?
1203,Raj,Oh so you are unencumbered?
1204,Penny,Hopefully he won’t be too upset.
1205,Leonard,Small world.
1206,Howard,I need an aspirin.
1207,Sheldon,Well I was in my room I couldn’t hear what they were saying.
1208,Leonard,No we play Rock Band on our X-Box.
1209,Sheldon,Two for two. I’m on fire.
1210,Sheldon,This table it’s in square centimetres. I read it as square metres. You know what that means?
1211,Sheldon,Oh uh Stuart Bert from the geology lab and Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs.
1212,Penny,Yeah well that’s not really my big problem.
1213,Sheldon,Yes there are.
1214,Sheldon,Two hundred pound transvestite with a skin condition yes she is.
1215,Sheldon,Of course not. Even in my sleep-deprived state I’ve managed to pull off another one of my classic pranks. Bazinga!
1216,Penny,No no. I want to know what you told her.
1217,Leonard,Hey Sheldon there’s something I want to talk to you about before we go to the party.
1218,Howard,Bring him to his bony knees.
1219,Sheldon,All right. What would you like me to do first?
1220,Sheldon,Hey that next of kin thing sounds pretty good.
1221,Leonard,Must we?
1222,Leonard,Wasn’t even that hard to find.
1223,Howard,Well I earned it dude I ate all my broccoli.
1224,Sheldon,The Hell Prawn lunges out of the hot spring. You block it with your shield. Do you attack?
1225,Sheldon,For goodness’ sake he’s wearing a hat glasses and a red striped shirt.
1226,Sheldon,That’s kind of a stretch. Look when it comes to social skills I’ve mastered the big three. There’s the coy smile. There’s the friendly chuckle. There’s the vocalization of sympathy. Aw. That last one’s tricky I’m still working on it.
1227,Sheldon,What do we have to lose?
1228,Sheldon,I knew it! What do I do?
1229,Sheldon,Use new eggs. .
1230,Raj,Bring him to his bony knees.
1231,Howard,Cool buddy! That’s awesome!
1232,Howard,How did that even happen? Did they know that’s what they were doing when they were doing it?
1233,Raj,Please have a seat.  I’m thinking double wedding!
1234,Sheldon,Come on Daddy needs a livable planet he can rule with an iron fist.
1235,Leonard,I know and I’m proud of you but that doesn’t mean I can’t do something nice. Like this.
1236,Leonard,Oh nothing’s going on. Excuse me.
1237,Raj,I was but it’s their anniversary and I didn’t want to be a third wheel so I figured I’d come over here and hang out with you and Penny on your date.
1238,Leonard,Yeah sure. You owe me.
1239,Leonard,Come on give him a hard one.
1240,Sheldon,Okay.
1241,Raj,You know Tor the God of Tunder. As I was saying is this a sign that our society is approaching gender equality?
1242,Raj,I took the liberty of burning us a mix of heroic questing music.
1243,Sheldon,It was its own point. Go on.
1244,Howard,Yes I do come on. See you later Leonard. 
1246,Leonard,No never mind alright go.
1247,Raj,The Fantastic Four reunited.
1248,Sheldon,Here comes the Embarrassment Express. With stops at Fraudville Wonder Blunderberg and Kansas City. Because it’s a hub.
1249,Sheldon,Well what a sad state of affairs. That you’ve all been so ground down by life you don’t even notice when someone disrespects you.
1250,Leonard,Sheldon sit!
1251,Leonard,Yeah.
1252,Raj,Oh my God. You’re loving this.
1253,Leonard,So Howard tell us how’s it feel knowing that when you two get married you’ll be referred to as Mr. and Dr. Wolowitz?
1254,Sheldon,Oh I ordered it before your surgery. It’s the urn I was going to put you in.
1255,Sheldon,He’s a snowy tree cricket and his name is Jiminy. 
1256,Raj,Oh yeah.
1257,Penny,Okay I didn’t know.
1258,Leonard,I said I’m her friend. Not her gay friend.
1259,Penny,Oh great. I don’t suppose you also brought napkins clean bowls utensils and a roll of toilet paper.
1260,Sheldon,Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced not shredded?
1261,Sheldon,It truly does capture the beauty of your friendship with Penny.
1262,Leonard,Okay him I believe because he’s an 80-year-old man in a 15-year-old’s tee shirt. But you’re just upset about Stuart and your mom and all their HBOs.
1263,Howard,I have a better idea.
1264,Penny,What? Is it another video of him and his dog Lady-and-the-Tramping some spaghetti?
1265,Sheldon,No. I think I’ll just go in this saloon and drink my troubles away.
1266,Raj,Hey look the lug nut’s off.
1267,Sheldon,Tell her you’re a circle Flatland gals are all hot for circles.
1268,Raj,I laughed because the guy was Leonard.
1269,Sheldon,Of course. I just explained it to you. Now where do you stand on it?
1270,Leonard,Look I admit it I may have crossed a line here but come on Raj your sister is a grown woman. To her I’m a forbidden piece of white chocolate.
1271,Penny,Well how do you feel?
1272,Penny,So uh Randall can’t believe after all these years you finally get to visit me in California.
1273,Leonard,Okay so to sum up one giant marble horse one asinine comment one lonely man and his chicken. And let’s see who’s left? Oh that’s right. My plans. Isn’t anyone going to ask?
1274,Leonard,Sheldon’s onion ring. Just put it back!
1275,Leonard,Actually Professor Norton can’t make it. He threw his back out rock climbing.
1276,Leonard,I hate all of you and myself. Three.
1277,Leonard,Come on Howard Bernadette you’re both scientists. Help me out here.
1278,Howard,Yeah.
1279,Sheldon,Why are you here?
1280,Leonard,Ah did you see that? She just touched his hand and he didn’t swat it away. What is happening?
1281,Raj,You could go to my guy. He’s at Juan-Juan in Beverly Hills. They bring you a cup of tea they’ll massage your scalp. It’s about two hundred dollars but sometimes you look in the next chair and you see a superstar like Tony Danza.
1282,Leonard,What if I dump you?
1283,Sheldon,Really Amy? Gossip? I’m disappointed in you.
1284,Howard,Yeah. Good or devastating.
1285,Leonard,Actually you can. There’s a whole sport built around it. Falconry.
1286,Leonard,What’s going on?
1287,Sheldon,But I feel like I could reach out and touch you.
1288,Sheldon,I can’t tell you that. I am bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.
1289,Sheldon,Don’t say it like that Leonard say it like we’re taking the train!
1290,Sheldon,Look around you there’s hypothetical broken glass everywhere. Really? You’re going to face Armageddon without your orthotics? All right your choice.  Uh-oh hypothetical aftershock!
1291,Penny,What’s going on?
1292,Sheldon,I am trying to prepare my lesson plan for Howard. Why are you telling me this?
1293,Penny,Aw did she hate you?
1294,Leonard,So now we’re just waiting for the data from the ship to be crunched but the numbers look pretty promising.
1295,Leonard,You’re awful quiet everything okay?
1296,Leonard,At the hands of your roommate?
1297,Sheldon,Leonard?
1298,Howard,It was tapenade and you guys suck.
1299,Leonard,Putting it in my phone right now.
1300,Raj,Yeah yeah yeah very perky.
1301,Leonard,Hey.
1302,Leonard,All right let’s let’s do couples. I want to.
1303,Sheldon,Big fat whopper. I hope it breaks.
1304,Sheldon,You didn’t have to do that.
1306,Raj,I don’t know if I’d say you… oh.
1308,Sheldon,Oh good lord.
1309,Howard,Any questions?
1310,Leonard,Penny you are on fire.
1311,Howard,It didn’t work for Randy it didn’t work for Tina it sure as hell isn’t gonna work for Jennifer.
1312,Leonard,When were you going to tell me about this?
1313,Sheldon,and the upper level is a bar that offers wine tastings if you’re going as far as Portland.
1314,Sheldon,Well let’s see uh she attempted to open her apartment with her car key because her face is overly Midwestern um she hasn’t had sex in six months and she ate a fly.
1315,Sheldon,Afraid not. Do you recognize this?
1316,Sheldon,Well I should hope so. Tomorrow’s picture day.
1317,Sheldon,I fail to see how a relationship can have the qualities of a geographic location.
1318,Howard,Nonsense. You need a little fattening up. You’ve been looking too skinny lately.
1319,Sheldon,Oh no I don’t think that’s true at all.
1320,Sheldon,Yes. She’s in the living room. Go I’ll wait here.
1321,Penny,Yeah that. Uh why don’t you bring her to my restaurant when I’m tending the bar so I can keep an eye on you?
1322,Leonard,No. I mean I’ll apply but I’m not gonna stoop to playing politics.
1323,Penny,Happy kitty sleepy…
1324,Howard,Well she was upset at first but probably because her sister shot somebody. Then there was something about you and… then she hugged me.
1325,Leonard,So basically this is what’s called mag-lev technology. It uses very powerful electromagnets to create a force strong enough to overcome gravity. Here you hold this.
1326,Penny,No Leonard’s taking me to a physics lecture and coffee’ll just keep me awake.  Oh I’ll get it.
1327,Raj,Yeah she seems friendly and easy to… never mind she’s gone. You know maybe talking to people is too hard.
1328,Leonard,No no what are you doing? He’s both happy and quiet. It’s like seeing a unicorn and Bigfoot at the same time.
1329,Leonard,Okay bye. My mother’s coming to visit.
1330,Leonard,Okay let’s try it this way. Remember the day that we first met and you asked me to go to your boyfriend’s apartment to get your TV back and he was nine feet tall and he took my pants off and you said… what was that? What did you say? Oh yes you said you owed me one.
1331,Raj,I know. Being an astrophysicist right now is like being a rock star.
1332,Leonard,If the past is any indication no.
1333,Leonard,Keep the clock Sheldon.
1334,Leonard,I regret not saying yes when you asked me to marry you.
1335,Sheldon,Yes.
1336,Penny,I never gave you a friendship bracelet.
1337,Sheldon,Well this is me. It’s been a very interesting evening.
1338,Leonard,Uh-huh.
1339,Leonard,Yeah this is nothing more than a physics problem.
1340,Penny,Yeah.
1341,Howard,I know.
1342,Penny,Oh that’s so sweet of you but I was gonna steal food from here. You know my treat.
1344,Sheldon,Whispering do not make a sound is a sound.
1345,Penny,Yeah. Why what happened?
1346,Penny,I can’t believe Leonard is spending hundreds of dollars on scalped tickets.
1347,Leonard,So anyway that’s great news about you and Bernadette.
1348,Sheldon,Unlikely. But make your case. Keeping in mind that your critical attitude is ruining our Saturday night together and I’m not above minimizing your window.
1349,Penny,Oh hey Leonard.
1350,Raj,Can you believe it? Little Priya’s one of the lead attorneys for the biggest car company in India.
1351,Raj,Maybe he’s playing bingo with his mommy.
1352,Penny,You’re welcome.
1353,Sheldon,Aren’t you afraid of being blinded?
1354,Sheldon,Just please bear with me if I display symptoms of caffeine withdrawal.
1355,Raj,I’m not gay.
1356,Leonard,It was good good. Just out of curiosity what time do you usually go to bed?
1357,Raj,Oh Howard stop.
1358,Leonard,That was fun Lesley thanks for including me.
1359,Penny,Yeah that’s terrific but what they wanted me to ask you was to cut it the hell out.  Happy birthday to you happy birthday to you…
1360,Penny,Oh yeah a lot of people think I’m a water sign. Okay let’s see what else oh I’m a vegetarian oh except for fish and the occasional steak I love steak.
1361,Sheldon,No that was the result of my work with lasers.
1362,Howard,No. Just the drawer.
1363,Penny,Hey Leonard?
1364,Penny,Not a chance.
1365,Penny,Yeah is it a comedy? Is it a drama? Nobody knows. Now come on. We are gonna do this.
1366,Penny,I just I can’t believe I trusted him.
1367,Howard,Oh you don’t want that.
1368,Sheldon,I’m hungry now.
1369,Sheldon,I don’t know. Perhaps.
1370,Howard,What’s the big deal? You guys are bringing your girlfriends. I didn’t want to sit by myself.
1371,Leonard,You can’t let this kid get to you. You always knew that someday someone would come along who was younger and smarter.
1372,Leonard,Hello.
1373,Leonard,Good good so who’s Stan Lee?
1376,Leonard,Would you just look inside?
1377,Raj,Are you asking because you want me there or out of pity? Actually never mind don’t answer. I’d love to.
1378,Sheldon,He said be honest so I was honest. Didn’t your mother tell you? It’s the best policy. So what do you say?
1379,Howard,Hey hey. Feelings.
1380,Penny,Ugh this is such a disaster. My parents had all my relatives over. They got one of those six-foot sandwiches and got my brother a day pass out of rehab and now he’s missing and the sandwich is missing and they’re probably in Mexico by now. So humiliating.
1381,Penny,Oh Amy really? She is not going to come on to Sheldon.
1382,Penny,Oh Leonard it’s three o’clock in the morning. I don’t care if Richard Feynman was a purple leprechaun who lived in my butt.
1383,Leonard,What?
1384,Howard,My Incredible Hulk hands signed by Stan Lee.
1385,Howard,Yeah well maybe the village was too busy checking out the local Montessori school for the new arrival.
1386,Leonard,No. Sulfites. Migraines.
1387,Penny,This is a whole lot of weird before coffee.
1388,Leonard,You got your job back. That is great news. I didn’t want to say anything but you are making the right choice. To plunge yourself into debt right now would be literally insane.
1389,Howard,What’s like what is wrong with me? Why why can’t I ever have love?
1390,Sheldon,Yes?
1391,Leonard,Yeah it’s all good. We-We’ll always have feelings for each other.
1392,Leonard,He’s just joining his friends; it’s fine.
1393,Leonard,Everyone stop. This was a stupid idea. Negative reinforcement isn’t working.
1394,Penny,Yeah.
1395,Sheldon,I’m okay. I’m okay. I’m not okay.
1396,Howard,What a douche.
1397,Leonard,All right let’s do it.
1398,Sheldon,Is Dr Gablehouser going to be my new daddy?
1399,Raj,Are you sure?
1400,Leonard,Sheldon there are a million great vacations you could take. What about Hawaii?
1401,Sheldon,Yes yes I’d be a physicist with a Nobel in chemistry. Everyone laugh at the circus freak. You know I don’t need to sit here and take this Flatow. It is because of bullies like you every day more and more Americans are making the switch to television.
1402,Leonard,Well if I had a gun there would you have shot yourself?
1403,Penny,What? Why?
1404,Sheldon,Her name is Dr. Stephanie Barnett and she is a highly distinguished surgical resident at Freemont Memorial.
1405,Sheldon,You’re going to leave me?
1406,Leonard,I don’t know but the girls do a lot for us. It’s the least we can do.
1407,Sheldon,Hey. Good news everybody. Now that I’m no longer with Amy I have an extra ticket to the annual Thanksgiving lunch buffet at the aquarium cafeteria. Who wants it? Well you realize you won’t be going alone I’ll be there the whole time. Providing fish and pilgrim facts. Can you people hear me?
1408,Leonard,Great.
1409,Raj,Uh a smile means something different in my country. You know tears of joy smile of sadness. India’s a goofy place.
1410,Leonard,What happened?
1411,Leonard,Sheldon? Sheldon are you okay?
1412,Howard,No doubt sign here.
1413,Howard,Okay now you’re talking like a winner!
1414,Raj,There are no Jewish hobbits.
1415,Leonard,Good-Bye Sheldon.
1416,Penny,Because I like peppermint and it’s fun to say schnapps. Hey Leonard?
1417,Sheldon,I wish I could believe you.
1418,Penny,Well you’re spending your birthday with Sheldon. Why not celebrate early?
1419,Penny,I’m gonna miss you too.
1420,Leonard,You must be very happy.
1421,Sheldon,How does it different from the money I have?
1422,Sheldon,Before you go consider this. Not only do I have a deep-cycle marine battery power source which is more than capable of running our entertainment system I also have all 61 episodes of the BBC series Red Dwarf and Fiddle-Faddle. All yours if you’re willing to reinstate the roommate agreement.
1423,Penny,Oh Mrs. Cooper it smells so good.
1424,Sheldon,Well I’m responding to it.
1425,Leonard,No I love them. I save them for the end but they’re gone because you ate them. And why did I let you eat them?
1426,Leonard,Oh no it’s like a horror movie. We’re trapped in a cabin with a maniac.
1427,Leonard,Yes
1428,Sheldon,Now that you’re in my debt please manipulate Amy into releasing me from my commitment to attend her aunt’s tedious birthday party.
1429,Leonard,Relax it’ll be fine sit down you guys.
1430,Howard,Great. Lost boys children of the night. Got it. Can you pass the Chex mix please. Thank you. We are lost boys.
1431,Raj,You know you and I have so much fun hanging out. If you were a girl all our problems would be solved.
1432,Howard,Check.
1433,Sheldon,Uh mee krob and chicken satay?
1434,Penny,That is so sad.
1435,Raj,Oh my God you’re back. Oh look at you. You you look like you grew.
1436,Leonard,Hey. So the guys and I are talking about having kind of a science retreat this weekend. I just wanted to know if that’s okay. You and I had talked about going to brunch on Sunday.
1437,Leonard,How’s that been working for you?
1438,Sheldon,All right let’s get this stupid play over with.
1439,Leonard,Yippee.
1440,Sheldon,All right now I’m starting to sense a little tension.
1441,Howard,Sorry go ahead and make your joke.
1442,Leonard,But I kind of have a girlfriend.
1443,Sheldon,No. Wait I want to guess. Don’t tell me.
1444,Sheldon,How about this? I promise I won’t pester you about the DVD. You can defecate in peace. That’s a win for both of us. But until this matter is resolved I would like you to wear this sweater. With nothing underneath it.
1445,Raj,Team Baby go.
1446,Sheldon,Fine. Leonard?
1447,Penny,No!
1448,Leonard,You’re right you’re lost good luck.
1449,Penny,Sure.
1450,Howard,Please Sheldon I’m a lost Indian boy far from home and I want a girlfriend and I want her to be Abby and she’ll only come over if she can bring Martha.
1451,Howard,Really?
1452,Penny,I don’t think I’ve eaten that much in my entire life.
1454,Leonard,I was a perfectly happy geeky little lonely guy and you ruined me!
1455,Sheldon,We might not get seats?
1456,Leonard,And you’re going to stay calm?
1457,Sheldon,So there are fresh linens on the bed and oh well now I see you’ve met Theodore. Theodore these are your new room mates Leonard and Penny. They’re very honest but I would not leave cash lying around.
1458,Penny,Oh. Okay. Well here’s um thirty something cents and a promise I won’t call your boss and tell him you reek of marijuana.
1459,Leonard,No uh that that’s it. I don’t know much about women. Raj you got anything?
1460,Sheldon,It’s time travel Leonard I will have already done that.
1461,Sheldon,Hey. Leonard is it awkward for you knowing that one of your dear friends had sexual intercourse with a woman you used to love in the very place you lay your head?
1462,Leonard,We’re not gonna be brothers. We’re not gonna be stepbrothers. Go to sleep.
1463,Sheldon,Well clearly it’s not whatever I want because what I want is for you to make this decision and you refuse to do that.
1464,Sheldon,Leonard listen to me…
1466,Leonard,Hang on. Maybe there should be a no insult clause about me too.
1467,Leonard,Okay so we now have a socially awkward genius in a room full of attractive age-appropriate women.
1468,Sheldon,Mandy Chao?
1469,Howard,Boy I’m so hungry today. I wonder why?
1470,Sheldon,That’s a good one. Okay now Leonard you tell a joke.
1471,Howard,Yeah s-so it’s like Kooper with a K?
1472,Raj,You guys know the new Discovery class missions that NASA’s been working on?
1473,Sheldon,Absolutely.
1474,Penny,Sheldon that’s so… 
1475,Sheldon,Me too. But he wasn’t was he?
1476,Penny,Wait.
1477,Howard,Papa please don’t start.
1478,Raj,Oh so my uh parents’ 40th anniversary’s coming up and I can’t think of a thing to get them.
1479,Leonard,Mr. Jeffries I am so sorry. We should’ve told you about the broken elevator.
1480,Sheldon,But I just got this pen. It’s got my initials on it and everything. Look.
1481,Sheldon,I can’t believe this. You’re happy I’m happy. Well maybe a holiday that’s all about giving isn’t so… Get your hand out of that box.
1482,Sheldon,You claim it’s going to be a week but I have no faith in your dry cleaner.
1483,Leonard,To show people when they don’t believe me.
1484,Howard,Yes. I picked her up and then we both went for massages to try and calm down. And then we got Pinkberry.
1485,Raj,Really? I’m sorry. I swear I know other words.
1486,Sheldon,Armin who?
1488,Leonard,Uh at least they’re talking about the theory. I mean that’s what’s important.
1489,Sheldon,Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Ooh 101! Air’s getting a bit thin up here.
1490,Leonard,I hate those movies.
1491,Raj,What the heck is this?
1492,Penny,Oh right bowling.
1493,Penny,Come on be serious.
1494,Sheldon,I assume we’re talking about you now?
1495,Raj,She feeds him out of her own mouth?
1496,Sheldon,You bet I did.
1497,Penny,Is that all?
1498,Sheldon,See now this is a man for Penny.
1499,Penny,Alright you know they have DVDs over there.
1500,Howard,Excuse me but I’m Indian.
1501,Howard,That’s the dynamic I’m the fun one you’re the buzzkill.
1502,Sheldon,Aw. Somebody’s ignoring their tiny needle teeth but all right.
1503,Leonard,No don’t aw him. He brought this all on himself.
1504,Sheldon,We’re not stopping.
1505,Sheldon,For a man whose last observation was our universe may be the surface of a multidimensional supercooled liquid you’re still awake seems like quite the sophomore slump.
1506,Raj,She’s very real.
1507,Leonard,Thank you.
1508,Leonard,What about Saturday?
1509,Leonard,What invitation?
1510,Howard,Okay. What shall be first to taste the wrath of Monte?
1511,Leonard,Exactly. Learn from my mistakes. No matter where I am at 718am there better be a toilet nearby.
1512,Leonard,Did not know that.
1513,Raj,Anyway if it’s okay with you we should talk about Howard’s bachelor party.
1514,Penny,In your apartment.
1515,Howard,Dude can you even open your mouth without spewing a cultural stereotype?
1516,Sheldon,No I am not. And this ESRAM buffer should totally bridge the 100-gigabit-per-second bandwidth gap between the two RAM types.
1517,Leonard,When you say non-related female you still mean human right?
1518,Sheldon,Fine then I was like Pinocchio before that jerk Geppetto went and made him a real boy.
1519,Sheldon,Possibly. I Tweeted him.
1520,Leonard,You mean like in bed or in the shower?
1521,Howard,Ten nine eight…
1522,Penny,All right let’s just get this stupid game over with.
1523,Penny,We’re going skiing in Switzerland?!
1524,Penny,Well it’s not forever. It’s just for a while. If you want we can think of him like he’s our dog.
1525,Penny,That’s not what I’m saying.
1526,Leonard,It’s okay. Did the right thing. You idiot!
1527,Leonard,He’s funny too. He does this hysterical impersonation of Stephen Hawking having phone sex. What are you wearing? That’s not he does it better. Anyway he said he was gonna take me to the gym tomorrow so I’m gonna go practice my situps.
1529,Leonard,So you think it’s fine if she works for Zack?
1530,Howard,Sure.
1531,Sheldon,Surely. Scissors cuts paper paper covers rock rock…
1532,Leonard,Okay I found the uh court papers that you and Zack need to fill out. I’ll print them when we get home.
1533,Leonard,Sheldon it’s a date I have a date coming over.
1534,Sheldon,You pushed it are you out of your mind?
1535,Leonard,Please Sheldon I am so not in the mood.
1537,Penny,You mean you and Dr. Slutbunny?
1538,Leonard,What was your first clue?
1539,Raj,Come on think back. It would really help if you had.
1540,Sheldon,Yes. Maybe she’ll feel so guilty she’ll never make me celebrate the holidays again.
1541,Raj,Ask why not again I’ve got an answer.
1542,Raj,Why Larry? Did Larry call dibs?
1543,Howard,Your mom creeps the hell out of me.
1545,Sheldon,The ring was unguarded it was just sitting on the table anyone could have taken it. Proof? I did.
1546,Raj,If they ever make a movie version of that book you know who should play Leonard’s mother? Sandra Bullock.
1547,Penny,Hey. So where are they?
1548,Sheldon,Well it’s very simple. In our ragtag band of scientists with nothing to lose I’m the smart one Wolowitz is the funny one and Koothrappali is the lovable foreigner who struggles to understand our ways and fails. That leaves you by default as the muscle.
1549,Leonard,Yeah. What if we do get caught who cares? So we get banned from Comic-Con.
1550,Sheldon,No thanks. I’m busy trying to fix this fuel pump.
1551,Sheldon,It has avocado on it. She’s allergic to avocado. Are you so jealous of our relationship you want Amy to die?
1552,Leonard,Really?
1553,Penny,What’s a multiverse?
1554,Raj,How many sips of that beer did he have?
1555,Howard,It’s pretty cool they’ve got me in with a guy who’s doing something about hunger in Indonesia and a psychotherapist who’s using dolphins to rehabilitate prisoners and Ellen Page star of the charming independent film Juno.
1556,Leonard,Oh um is Penny here?
1557,Raj,Anyway I was hoping I could uh pick your brains a little. I’m supposed to take Lucy out Friday and I need a killer first date.
1558,Penny,That’s on the registration?
1559,Penny,Can’t.
1560,Penny,I’ve got wine at my place and some bubble wrap we could pop.
1561,Sheldon,And you’re wrong about Hinduism and cows.
1562,Sheldon,Oh Penny where do I begin? The simple-mindedness of your idea is exceeded only by its crass consumerism and banality.
1563,Leonard,I’m sure we’ll find a decent chapel.
1564,Raj,I don’t want to celebrate.
1565,Penny,No.
1566,Penny,It’s exactly the same…
1567,Raj,Oh they did. Like jasmine and honeysuckle.
1568,Sheldon,Yeah.
1569,Sheldon,Yeah that too. And scoot over. Part of your shadow’s on my spot.
1570,Sheldon,No. I don’t believe you. I could tell.
1571,Penny,Get out! Who needs a thousand sparkly flower barrettes with rhinestones?
1572,Leonard,There there’s chapters about potty training and bed-wetting and masturbation. Basically if something came out of me she wrote about it. You know what? Do whatever you want just don’t talk to me about it.
1573,Sheldon,Leonard I believe it is. This is trash talk and trash talk is a traditional component in all sporting events. Kripke your robot is inferior and it will be defeated by ours because ours exceeds yours in both design and execution. Also I’m given to understand that your mother is overweight.
1574,Sheldon,Oh the walls are dripping blood which looks nothing like a phenolphthalein indicator exposed to a sodium carbonate solution.  Ah. Okay all right. That one was clever. Skeleton with phosphorous on a zip line. Come on out merry pranksters. Take a bow.
1575,Penny,Of course.
1576,Sheldon,Mm. Your aunt in Modesto?
1577,Penny,No.
1578,Sheldon,What do you do you just go out there and gambol about like a bunny?
1579,Leonard,Mm-hmm.
1580,Howard,Well in The Sound of Music Julie Andrews says let’s start at the very beginning a very good place to start.
1581,Penny,I wonder if it’s from like ancient Rome where they’d actually chop somebody’s ass off and then go here. You know to appease Loseroneous the god of losers.
1583,Penny,Hey guys this is my friend Zack.
1584,Leonard,Every once in a while before we’d go to bed I’d put on a little show for her.
1585,Leonard,Yeah.
1586,Leonard,Is that what he’s drinking? It’s not even real beer.
1587,Howard,Hey what’s your problem?
1588,Raj,Oh right. Good one.
1589,Howard,I was afraid of that.  Go ahead.
1590,Leonard,Wait a minute you have a guy?
1591,Penny,Yeah we labeled them stop and go.
1592,Raj,Uh yeah can you uh reach that uh gravy boat up there?
1593,Leonard,Swell. If you’re lucky maybe she’ll show you the PowerPoint presentation.
1594,Leonard,Come on! There’s over 200 questions. And look at some of these things. Sheldon is to camaraderie as the space shuttle is to blank?
1595,Penny,Yeah. Hey how come you’ve never done anything romantic to celebrate our first date?
1596,Sheldon,Oh very much so.
1597,Raj,Hey don’t bag on Sandra Bullock! You think it makes you look cultured but you just come off as bitter.
1598,Leonard,Um I don’t know maybe.
1599,Leonard,Well okay. Again thank you.
1600,Leonard,Hear hear.
1601,Howard,Eleven.
1602,Raj,You ever gonna tell him?
1603,Leonard,I um I don’t follow.
1604,Howard,Why don’t you just have Robert E. Lee charge the line with Shiva and Ganesh.
1605,Sheldon,She got lucky.
1606,Raj,Oh that’s a nice one. Was it yours when you were little?
1607,Penny,Ooh strike three.
1608,Penny,Yeah okay. The thing is I kind of told my father we got back together again.
1609,Sheldon,Well my game is better ’cause instead of marrying someone you get to eat them.
1610,Howard,I don’t know. Why do I own one?
1611,Sheldon,I don’t think so. I believe that a joke is a brief oral narrative with a climactic humorous twist. For example uh Wolowitz’s mother is so fat that she decided to go on a diet or exercise or both. See? The twist is that people don’t usually change. Well they don’t.
1612,Sheldon,Well perhaps I am a little under the weather. It’s nothing a little cold medicine and tea can’t fix.
1613,Leonard,Oh my God I’m going blind.
1614,Sheldon,Lock and load.
1615,Penny,Guys if I wanted to hear people be bitchy I’d go to my real salon.
1616,Sheldon,Why do you hate me?
1617,Sheldon,Fusion and Asians? I’m trying not to think about science.
1618,Leonard,If there was an asteroid strike wouldn’t you die too?
1619,Penny,Are you done?
1620,Sheldon,No visiting professor. Anyway the local cuisine was a little more sausage-based than I’m used to and the result was an internal blitzkrieg with my lower intestine playing the part of Czechoslovakia.
1621,Howard,Wait how can how can anyone ruin Raiders? It’s perfect.
1622,Penny,Just open it.
1623,Leonard,I mean without lying.
1624,Sheldon,Time machine.
1625,Penny,No but now that you’re being weird about it maybe I should.
1626,Leonard,How is that my fault?
1627,Howard,Hey make sure you tell him that you weren’t home when he came by and that your Indian friend gave you the message the moment you stepped through the door.
1628,Penny,Oh. Good for you. So all you have to do here is say you’re sorry to Leonard but say it sarcastically.
1629,Sheldon,I suppose that’s true. You’re such a glass half-full kind of guy. I’m going to miss that.
1630,Leonard,No kidding.
1631,Sheldon,So I hear you saying you’re angry with your mother.
1632,Leonard,Thank you.
1633,Howard,Oh I totally am. If it wasn’t for this beer I couldn’t even talk to you right now. I’m a wreck. There are many things seriously wrong with me. And not quirks either. Like diagnosable psychological problems. Maybe brain damage.
1634,Leonard,So are you gonna see her again?
1635,Penny,Mm-hmm.
1636,Sheldon,You do?
1637,Sheldon,I can’t take the bus any more. They don’t have seatbelts. And they won’t let you lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords.
1638,Sheldon,Okay. But I think it could have ended with the karaoke.
1639,Leonard,Come on it’s just a video game. And we suck at it.
1640,Penny,Okay okay okay. Thumbs down. Next.
1641,Howard,I know. Powerful stuff huh?
1642,Sheldon,Yes. I play the word quiver with a triple letter and a double word score for 72 points. That ought to let the air out of your tyres Hawking.
1643,Sheldon,No I’ll go to your haggis party. But I’m telling you this is adness. This is utter and coplete adness.
1644,Sheldon,I’m sorry but at what point do you put this see what you can do plan into action?
1645,Penny,Just go.
1646,Leonard,Come on buddy.
1647,Sheldon,Oh no they found the element.  No no stop it. I don’t need to take this admiration from the likes of you people. How do I make them stop loving me?
1648,Penny,You still see her?
1649,Leonard,You’re kidding.
1650,Penny,Well it’s not just the pants it’s just it’s like since we got married he doesn’t really try any more.
1651,Sheldon,That doesn’t help.
1652,Howard,Screw you. That was a beautifully written penis metaphor.
1653,Leonard,And what would that be?
1654,Penny,Uh well no no not in… not in those words.
1655,Sheldon,Yes.
1656,Raj,Oh this is like a nightmare. Get lost!
1657,Raj,Penny how’s it going over there?
1659,Penny,Hey can I start you off with something to drink?
1660,Sheldon,And taking her first step towards a lifetime of laughter love and best of all rules.
1661,Howard,Without me.
1662,Leonard,Making pretty good time huh?
1663,Sheldon,Put it on. Let’s share the experience.
1664,Leonard,Yes.
1665,Penny,Hey I bought M&Ms at the vending machine and two bags came out.
1666,Sheldon,Oh now Perlmutter’s shaking the King’s hand. Yeah check for your watch Gustaf. He might have lifted it.
1667,Howard,No he’s doesn’t! He’s lying to you!
1668,Sheldon,Impressive but we must be cautious.
1669,Leonard,Great. So you just let me know when you know. So…  Oh God I am the bad fish! What did I do wrong?
1670,Raj,Oh okay. Uh brothers and sisters I have none but this man’s father is my father’s son. Who am I looking at? Yeah yeah we get it you want brains. Calm down.
1671,Raj,Okay and tree pose.
1672,Sheldon,What you’re familiar with the reference?
1673,Raj,Yeah that’s good. Keep telling yourself that. 
1674,Leonard,Oh you admit that it’s our work.
1675,Howard,I’m Raj by the way. This is Howard.
1676,Sheldon,Oh no she doesn’t even know she has it. No I had my sister slip it in her bag so that I can track her like a sea turtle.
1677,Penny,Oh. Oh my God that is the most beautiful thing anyone’s ever said to me.
1678,Raj,I’m a little jealous of the people who get to do it.
1679,Penny,I go outside and I talk to people. Alright here what actor holds the record for being named people magazine’s sexiest man alive?
1680,Raj,Well I know how you feel. I tried one of those electronic Japanese toilets practically shot myself across the room.
1681,Leonard,I’m sorry. I was just trying to help.
1682,Penny,What?
1683,Sheldon,Well that seems like a snooze. Even for public radio.
1684,Leonard,What?
1685,Penny,Hi. Ready to go?
1686,Raj,I thought that too. But then I got my first waffle maker and never questioned her again.
1688,Leonard,No.
1689,Howard,I’m sure you were great.
1691,Howard,I’m sorry I seem to be taking an annoying amount of time deciding how I feel about this.
1692,Leonard,The dealer doesn’t care Kripke has no authority over us and you being related to a metal container would explain a lot. Help me hook this up.
1693,Leonard,Dear God no!
1694,Howard,No not at all.
1695,Raj,Hey Stuart come on in.
1696,Penny,Um… three little kittens? Three little pigs? God I don’t know. Star Wars?
1697,Sheldon,Well Alfred has secrets too.
1698,Leonard,Oh my God are you okay?
1699,Sheldon,She was going to see through your lie eventually so I told her that you were lying to protect me.
1700,Sheldon,It’s not a death ray. It’s just a little ultrasonic blast to scare him off. Trust me if I had a death ray I wouldn’t be living here. I’d be in my lair enjoying the money the people of Earth gave me for not using my death ray. All right and in three two one. 
1701,Raj,Getting kind of grim.
1702,Sheldon,Well in that case try removing the irritating patch of brown skin standing next to you.
1703,Penny,Okay what do you think?
1704,Penny,Oh and don’t cheap out on the tip. We all know you’re loaded now.
1705,Leonard,Well you know the way I took my clothes off.
1706,Sheldon,And every morning.
1707,Sheldon,Howard and Bernadette you tried to comfort me when I was ill and I treated you terribly. I’m sorry.
1708,Penny,Come here. 
1709,Howard,You know what? You’re my best friend and she’s in a bad marriage. I give you my blessing.
1710,Howard,Here you go. I’ve got everything we’ll need for the big game. Low fat turkey jerky low-carb beer 100-calorie snack packs.
1711,Leonard,Wow.
1712,Leonard,Right. Lesley I would like to propose an experiment.
1713,Howard,Wait hang on. If you’re really Nathan Fillion what’s the line from Firefly about your bonnet?
1714,Penny,Hey Leonard. Dave was just showing me around the university. You know this place is unbelievable!
1715,Leonard,Yeah.
1716,Penny,Get over yourself. I whistled you came running.
1717,Howard,Yes please. This is way better than the movie.
1718,Sheldon,Found one.
1719,Raj,What’s your name?
1720,Sheldon,I’m certainly glad no one said they were curious about Aztec human sacrifice.
1721,Howard,The Wolowitz Coefficient?
1722,Sheldon,Penny.
1723,Raj,Look at this mouthwash lotion body wash shampoo and conditioner together in one tiny bottle. I love Las Vegas.
1724,Howard,Okay I get it he’s a bad guy. Sign here.
1725,Howard,A lane frequented by liars. Like you you big liar.
1726,Leonard,I do.
1727,Howard,Well I’ve been thinking about you. How are you doing? Are you happy Mummy?
1728,Raj,We went to the comic book store last night.
1729,Howard,Forget the Jet Skis? That was our line in the sand! What happened to “tear them a new one?”
1730,Raj,Oh yeah? Well I’ve been taking Pilates class at the rec center and my abs look like sections of a Hershey bar.
1731,Sheldon,No Leonard said nothing but who knows what goes on over here when he pretends your mail was misdelivered.
1732,Sheldon,Penny my body and I have a relationship that works best when we maintain a cool wary distance from each other.
1733,Howard,Come on you know I can’t talk to women unless I’m lit up like the Hindu festival of Diwali.
1735,Leonard,Excuse me. Sheldon we both agreed to do this.
1736,Sheldon,I’m the boss. I make the jokes.
1737,Sheldon,No.
1738,Howard,Well so? So you think Bernadette’s just gonna let you jet down to San Diego for five days and leave her alone?
1739,Leonard,Well I’m sure at some point we won’t even notice it’s there.
1740,Penny,Uh actually I’m in Vegas. Leonard and I are about to get married.
1741,Sheldon,About what?
1742,Sheldon,re they making fun of us?
1743,Sheldon,All right. I think I cracked the code to lower the drawbridge.
1744,Sheldon,So?
1745,Howard,I knew it. Okay we did have a vibe. This is exciting. What’s my next move?
1746,Leonard,Can we just forget I said Defcon and go?
1747,Penny,Oh are you shy?
1748,Penny,No it’s fine I know you don’t like the way I drive.
1749,Raj,Oh sure I sit on the floor for years no one cares. The pretty white girl’s there ten seconds and suddenly we’re all running to IKEA.
1750,Sheldon,You’ve dedicated your life’s work to educating the general populace about complex scientific ideas.
1751,Raj,If you look carefully at Venus you should be able to see the International Space Station pass by.
1752,Howard,I’m all out.
1753,Sheldon,For the record I do have genitals. They’re functional and aesthetically pleasing.
1754,Sheldon,That my genius…
1755,Penny,Yeah but I told you I’m not good at my job. Bernadette listen to me. He is never gonna leave.
1756,Leonard,No no friends forgive the little things.
1757,Raj,Who else could it be? It has to be Eddie Crispo.
1758,Sheldon,Please that’s a seagull. If you’re not going to help don’t help.
1759,Sheldon,I do. Do you? Because frankly you’ve been in a foul mood since I sat down.
1760,Penny,Oh you poor thing. Is having a real-life girlfriend who has sex with you getting in the way of your board games?
1761,Howard,You two should be ashamed of yourselves. Using women to advance your cause with sexuality and whatever Amy plans on doing.
1762,Penny,All right Sheldon what part of this is supposed to make me feel better?
1763,Sheldon,I saw. And I just posted a retraction of my paper. Now the whole scientific community knows I was wrong.
1764,Leonard,Girls don’t count Klingon Howard. Right?
1765,Penny,Wow. Yeah b-beginner’s luck. So now I will drink this entire cup of beer and you will go again and we can… uh… all right. So yeah okay now I’m gonna drink this entire cup and then I’m going to drink another one… Okay seriously stop. What the hell?
1766,Leonard,We’re good.
1767,Penny,There you go. Just like recovering alcoholics drink in the Caribbean.
1768,Leonard,Okay terrific. Um uh listen is there a way that we can do this where he doesn’t know that you’re a… you know…
1769,Sheldon,I’m quite aware of the way humans usually reproduce which is messy unsanitary and based on living next to you for three years involves loud and unnecessary appeals to a deity.
1770,Sheldon,That’s it. I’m in breach of my security clearance. I’m going to prison. And you know what happens to people like me in prison. I’ll be forced to be some large man’s tutor.
1771,Sheldon,No on the contrary. I found the Grinch to be a relatable engaging character and I was really with him right up to the point that he succumbed to social convention and returned the presents and saved Christmas. What a buzz kill that was.
1772,Penny,Well which is it?
1773,Sheldon,Well given my history on the subject t seems a little reckless to bring it up now.
1774,Howard,I promise. Why what’s in there?
1775,Penny,Oh Leonard.
1776,Penny,Don’t you have a guy?
1777,Penny,Yeah okay. That’s uh that’s good.
1778,Sheldon,Yeah not to be confused with the French Fry Goodness Inventory. That’s pure Cooper.
1779,Raj,Oh don’t be such gloomy Gusses. Look at the size of these shrimp! At what point do we start calling them lobsters?
1780,Leonard,What does that mean?
1781,Leonard,Actually it’s not all that easy to find.
1782,Penny,Good afternoon and welcome to today’s physics bowl practice round. I’m Penny and I’ll be your host because apparently I didn’t have anything else to do on a Saturday afternoon and isn’t that just a little sad? Gentlemen are you ready?
1783,Penny,I just think it might look more natural if you talked to me instead of the camera you know like like a real conversation. It’s something we work on in my acting class.
1784,Leonard,Do you want the last dumpling Sheldon?
1785,Penny,Really?
1786,Sheldon,Oh but I won’t be there.
1787,Howard,All right. Would you mind if I went to your room and downloaded some Asian pornography?
1788,Leonard,Uh okay.
1789,Leonard,So what’s the gossip?
1790,Penny,Oh please you’re barely interested in a physical relationship with one person. Why would you want to confuse and disappoint others?
1791,Sheldon,We stayed for the California Adventure water show. It was pure Disney magic.
1792,Sheldon,Well of course you don’t get it I haven’t made it yet. You’d have to be psychic to get it and there’s no such thing as psychic.
1793,Howard,Boy all this standing’s making me tired. Good thing I brought my collapsible stick chair.
1794,Howard,Well unlike that my games are much more fun.
1795,Sheldon,Oh! How about we put awhoopee cushion on his office chair? He’ll sit down it’ll sound like he’s flatulent even though he’s not.
1796,Sheldon,You ready to begin?
1797,Leonard,Why should we leave? For all we know he crashed the party and Penny doesn’t even want him here. .
1798,Penny,Oh hey what’s going on?
1799,Penny,Sure. Raj hug Howard.
1800,Sheldon,I don’t know if I’d call it discussing. You kind of sat back and let me do all the work. Let’s see what’s next on the list. Oh uh do you whittle and if so what kind of knife do you use.
1801,Sheldon,Wrong Just because I enjoyed that one doesn’t mean I always do.
1802,Howard,Great what’s your pl… 
1803,Penny,Uh about two years ago.
1804,Sheldon,Oh give me that. Just out of curiosity if I were to let something go how would I do that?
1805,Raj,All right hotshot let’s hear your Indian.
1806,Raj,Okay so not her either. How about her?
1807,Sheldon,Roommate agreement section 27 paragraph 5 the roommate agreement like the American flag cannot touch the ground.
1808,Raj,I hadn’t spoken to Emily since I broke up with her and she left this on my doorstep with a note.
1809,Leonard,Who wouldn’t?
1810,Sheldon,No popcorn at the mo… listen to yourself.
1811,Sheldon,No I believe Leonard is waiting for you to come crawling back to him and apologize.
1812,Howard,What are you drinking?
1813,Penny,I think it’s so adorable you’re making Sheldon breakfast.
1814,Penny,Yeah Hi listen as long as I’m here I’m on a quest with a bunch of noobs they don’t know what they’re doing we’ve got one assassin three spellcasters and no tank.
1815,Sheldon,The majority of people have dark hair. Even you at one time.
1816,Penny,I know it’s so insulting. At one point they had me figure out how to get a banana out of a puzzle box.
1817,Sheldon,You did this didn’t you?
1818,Sheldon,That depends how much longer do you plan on fondling my shoulder?
1819,Sheldon,That sounds awful. Raj?
1820,Leonard,You know what? You’re a crazy person.
1821,Leonard,I was not gonna propose. It’s already two to one.
1822,Leonard,Yeah. Let me finish packing this stuff up. You know how Sheldon is if he sees Christmas stuff lying around after New Year’s.
1823,Penny,Yeah when we first met you said that if I went out with you I could drive a car on Mars.
1824,Leonard,Don’t beat yourself up. You’ve never lived with anyone before.
1825,Penny,Whatcha doing?
1826,Leonard,Yes! For God’s sake Sheldon do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time I open my mouth.
1827,Sheldon,There’s only one logical explanation. Somewhere in the desert we crossed into an alternate dimension where the women in our lives can finally appreciate great literature.
1828,Penny,Wow you’re like a dog with a bone aren’t you?
1829,Penny,See there it is there’s that twinkle.
1830,Raj,Wow. What a great night.
1831,Penny,Well doesn’t matter if she gets it as long as she’s pretty.
1832,Howard,That’s sweet of you. But what can you do to help?
1833,Penny,Okay well that was murder this was an accident.
1834,Leonard,You’re making fun of me. Forget it.
1835,Leonard,How you feeling?
1836,Howard,Oh did you hear from Wil?
1837,Penny,Where you going?
1838,Sheldon,Fine. Amy will you be my girlfriend?
1839,Penny,You can keep that too.
1840,Sheldon,Wrong. Hunt’s. Hey Amy what do you say? You ready to move on to the mustard round?
1841,Leonard,Well yes but things have changed you know you’re older I’m older. Look no more superhero bedsheets.
1842,Penny,Why?
1843,Sheldon,Of course. Would you like to join me for Chinese food?
1844,Penny,My point is I know more about dating than you and if you were as smart as you think you are you would listen to me.
1845,Leonard,I know you don’t like change but it’s not a terrible idea.
1846,Sheldon,Really? A blazer? All right.  Yes hello. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah I’m at 2311 North Robles Avenue. Yeah I’d like to report a dangerous wild animal. A blue jay. I’m sorry this is Animal Control. I don’t understand the laughter. No the bird is not in my home. If he was in my home I obviously would have called 911. Sir I have no doubt that there are things that you’re frightened of. Being stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or your wife stepping out on you because you’re stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or spiders? Don’t you think I tried making cat noises?
1847,Leonard,Yeah. I’m excited to help.
1848,Leonard,Don’t ask me. A little elf did it.
1849,Sheldon,Well for one thing she was French. For another it was literature.
1850,Penny,Geez what a fun couple.
1851,Penny,I’m so sorry I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn’t be such an ass.
1852,Leonard,Oh crap. What are we gonna do?
1853,Sheldon,She’s learning English from TV.
1854,Leonard,And you guys are going together great…
1855,Sheldon,Is it me or does she not look so good?
1856,Leonard,Why? Nothing is ever going to happen between me and Alex.
1857,Penny,I bought new clothes okay? Is Leonard around?
1858,Penny,Yeah thanks but I kind of feel like eating alone tonight so…
1859,Raj,What? Don’t send me home. I can’t be alone right now.
1860,Sheldon,And rubber gloves uh air freshener. Um noise-cancelling headphones. Oh danger whistle. Um pepper spray. Ooh a multi-language occupied sign. Uh let’s see we have seat protectors uh booties for my shoes a clothespin for my nose. Oh and a mirror on a stick so I can make sure the person in the stall next to me isn’t some kind of weirdo.
1861,Leonard,Air freshener.
1862,Penny,Mm-hmm.
1863,Raj,I feel cool. Like Puss in Boots.
1864,Raj,Yeah what if I buy my own desk?
1865,Leonard,Not unless she destroys Tokyo.
1866,Sheldon,Kenya rises to power on the export of rhinoceroses. A Central African power block is formed colonizing North Africa and Europe. When war breaks out no one can afford the luxury of a rhino. Kenya withers Uganda triumphs.
1867,Leonard,Uh okay okay. Uh we we get it.
1868,Leonard,Oh great. We’re still dating right?
1869,Penny,Oh it’s not so bad. You lost money you’re filled with shame and you got groped by a stranger. I mean that’s Vegas you nailed it.
1870,Penny,Okay. Goodnight Sheldon.
1871,Raj,I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again. Aquaman sucks.
1872,Raj,Really? Us gonna tell him?
1873,Penny,And there’s your next T-shirt.
1874,Sheldon,And…
1875,Sheldon,Of course not. I’m a theoretical physicist a career I chose in no small part because it’s indoors but if I’m able to detect slow-moving magnetic monopoles there I will be the scientist to confirm string theory. People will write books about me. Third-graders will create macaroni-art dioramas depicting scenes from my life.
1876,Leonard,Hey how’d it go?
1877,Leonard,Well give it a go.
1878,Leonard,Penny can I talk to you for a minute? Hi.
1879,Leonard,No you wouldn’t have.
1880,Howard,I think I swallowed some paint!
1881,Howard,Beefaroni and a show? How do you turn that down?
1882,Leonard,Hang on a second. I could have the fruit platter.
1883,Leonard,Really? You’re just gonna let me go by myself?
1884,Sheldon,That’s what you said about The Green Lantern movie. You were 114 minutes of wrong.
1885,Howard,She said she didn’t want to see me any more and I found that insulting.
1886,Raj,What the? Are you crazy? You can’t talk about social anxiety to someone who has social anxiety. It makes them socially anxious!
1887,Sheldon,Then this is my first date.
1888,Raj,Correct.
1889,Raj,For what making me sound like a Simpsons character?
1890,Leonard,Stop stop it quit it. 
1891,Sheldon,What is it?
1892,Leonard,Go ask Penny; she’ll know what to do.
1893,Sheldon,That seems fair we did just give you the painting.
1894,Howard,Did you guys see the new budget memo that went out this morning?
1895,Sheldon,How thoughtful. Thank you.
1896,Raj,Uh well I was dating a woman at the university but we broke up.
1897,Penny,Well I am.
1898,Sheldon,I didn’t want to come in. I was told it would make everyone feel uncomfortable. So I’ll just stay out here and pretend that I don’t have to go to the bathroom.
1899,Sheldon,I may never stop thinking about it. Amy what are the odds we run into this guy?
1900,Raj,Okay well if I move in you can’t use mine. Hold on a second. Hey Howard uh how’s the Wi-Fi in the garage?
1901,Penny,All right I don’t understand. Why didn’t you just tell Kripke the truth?
1903,Leonard,Maybe but I’m guessing it will cost you about $500 an hour to try.
1904,Leonard,Whatever. You have to do something about it.
1905,Sheldon,That’s an excellent idea. Yeah if we chat it will create the illusion of time going faster.
1906,Sheldon,Leonard do you really think you can satisfy your need for a relationship with a genetically altered cat?
1907,Leonard,Yeah it’s delicious the sarcasm’s a little stale though. Hey how about this? Until we figure out what to do with the ring Penny holds on to it.
1908,Penny,Bert you’re a good guy you deserve a woman who’s interested in more than just your money.
1909,Howard,Oh yeah? Well I’ve been taking Pilates class at the rec center and my abs look like sections of a Hershey bar.
1910,Howard,You mean a moo-stache?
1911,Sheldon,I’ll tell you why.
1912,Leonard,Two hundred.
1913,Sheldon,A quarter.
1914,Howard,None taken. You should hear how she talks about you.
1915,Leonard,Because it doesn’t matter. I don’t care if we’re a ten or a two.
1916,Sheldon,Hold on. If you don’t want to live with Leonard why don’t you just tell him?
1917,Howard,Hey look at that.  It’s Dennis Kim.
1918,Sheldon,Sing soft kitty.
1919,Leonard,She’s gotten really hooked on Age of Conan she’s playing non-stop.
1920,Penny,How about I go first?
1921,Sheldon,Do you think he’s right? Am I wasting my life on a theory that can never be proven?
1922,Sheldon,Under the sink yellow Tupperware bowl.
1923,Howard,Here we go. Lock up your daughters! We’re going to hit it and quit it.
1924,Howard,I feel bad for the guy.
1925,Raj,You weren’t?
1926,Penny,Oh don’t worry I won’t.
1927,Raj,Alright uh fine I’m coming and I’m bringing somebody. Uh Koothrappali plus one.
1928,Penny,All right fine. How are we supposed to set up machines and conveyor belts in my apartment?
1929,Leonard,Like I would swing with him.
1930,Sheldon,What?
1931,Leonard,Got it.
1932,Sheldon,It was listed under seafood.
1933,Sheldon,Well I must say Leonard when I first heard your idea for Giant Jenga I was sceptical.
1934,Sheldon,He must be very skilled at coitus.
1935,Sheldon,This is a Bunsen burner. I’m a scientist I know what I’m doing. Oh drat.  Aw. It took me a gallon of urine to make that water.
1936,Penny,Really? Are you drunk?
1937,Raj,It could be a trans-Neptunian object.
1938,Raj,How come you’re not shopping with Amy and Bernadette?
1939,Penny,Ooh.
1940,Sheldon,I don’t know what she’s talking about but I’m obligated to agree with her. She’s my girlfriend.
1941,Leonard,Honestly because I had enough crappy Christmases as a kid and I’m tired of you sucking the joy out of them now.
1942,Penny,This is just something you usually do together and if I’m screwing it up I don’t have to go.
1943,Sheldon,And you also have a note from your mother that says I love you bubbula. But neither of those is a cogent argument for titanium over nanotubes.
1944,Raj,What? What are you talking about?
1945,Sheldon,Thank you. Is someone smoking?
1946,Leonard,That only applies if you need me to help you destroy an artificial intelligence you created that’s taking over the Earth.
1947,Penny,No wait wait no wait. Wh.. what are you doing here?
1948,Penny,You know like what’s his deal? Is it girls? Guys? Sock puppets?
1949,Leonard,You can’t kill him he’ll just respawn at the last save point.
1951,Raj,Well astrophysicist.
1952,Sheldon,I thought this was supposed to be a guided meditation.
1953,Howard,Wow. An end of an era.
1954,Leonard,Hang on. Some guy is going to be sleeping on your couch?
1955,Penny,Hey I talked to her for five minutes yesterday and I’ve been half bombed ever since.
1956,Leonard,Why does he need a baby? He’s already hairless and smells like talcum powder.
1957,Howard,You guys are being jerks.
1958,Sheldon,We just had a major crime in the building and you open the door without asking who it is?
1959,Raj,Yeah it is. And you know we get to name it.
1960,Penny,Yeah. We could give it to Sheldon and tell him William Shatner painted it.
1961,Raj,Okay gotta go.
1962,Leonard,All right well let me see if I can explain your situation using physics. What would you be if you were attached to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis?
1963,Penny,Well I finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bar tending shift so I need to practice making drinks.
1964,Penny,Let’s say 4390.
1965,Leonard,In a word triumphant.
1966,Howard,Not as fun as the night we blew up grapes in the microwave. We really have led full lives.
1967,Leonard,Oh uh uh uh sausage. Uh uh uh uh bratwurst? Oh oh a hot dog.
1968,Penny,Yep. What’s the code?
1969,Raj,If you don’t want to look foolish doing something you should practice. Do you know how many Beef Wellingtons I made by myself before I invited you guys over? I’ll give you a hint. You can see them here here and here.
1970,Penny,I didn’t know him very well but I still really liked him. It’s weird that he’s just gone.
1971,Sheldon,Why?
1972,Howard,Leonard stole my woman and he knew full well I was only six to eight months away from making my move.
1973,Raj,I did do that. I can be insensitive to other people’s boundaries. Howard would you write that down?
1974,Penny,Howard didn’t you say you worked on the Mars Rover?
1975,Leonard,Please. Sheldon would have been before you and he might not even have genitals.
1976,Sheldon,You know I’m proud of me too. I’ve done all my research I conducted an informal poll and I’ve arrived at the rock-solid certainty I’ve made the right choice.
1977,Howard,Yeah.
1978,Leonard,Problem with the WiFi?
1979,Howard,No that’s okay. I’ll get it.
1980,Penny,Well I’m sorry Sheldon but this really isn’t about you.
1981,Penny,Excuse me I was in high school. Studying keeping my nose clean doing volunteer work for the community. 
1982,Sheldon,Hello.
1983,Leonard,Sometimes he brings a toy xylophone. I am really sorry about this.
1984,Sheldon,Well first we buttered my feet to get the swim fins off and then we went out.
1985,Leonard,So the entire scientific community is just supposed to take your word?
1986,Sheldon,You heard the man Leonard. And while you’re at it I’m upset that we have an unannounced houseguest so make me cocoa. Point of inquiry given that Leonard is your secondary friend and Koothrappali is your primary friend why didn’t you seek refuge under his roof?
1987,Sheldon,I really don’t understand your objections Professor Goldfarb why wouldn’t the Senoran Desert make a perfectly good promised land?
1988,Leonard,What recordings?
1989,Penny,What? Are you really upset about Randall coming?
1990,Leonard,Of course not. I mean he’s your brother.
1991,Howard,It’s easy. The spider’s crawling up your arm.
1992,Howard,Ha-ha very funny. Make fun of the foreign guy. For your information there are four times as many Indians as there are Americans so the way we say it is right.
1993,Howard,Uh actually if it’s not too much to ask could we have the Jewish girlfriend experience.
1994,Sheldon,Oh! I love trains!
1995,Sheldon,I don’t need your help Penny.
1996,Raj,I don’t know if I want to play anymore.
1997,Sheldon,Don’t be silly. Howard you do not have a PhD your cologne is an assault on the senses and you’re not available for video games during the Jewish high holidays.
1998,Penny,Uhbubububuh I can make do with just the candle.
1999,Raj,Thank you.
2000,Sheldon,I’m going to propose a hypothesis. Last night Raj accidentally made contact with an alien civilization and has been ordered by the United States government to keep it a secret.
2001,Howard,Hey Penny can you give me a hand with this?
2002,Sheldon,I do indeed Mr. Box-Thinking.
2003,Leonard,ghobe’ 
2004,Howard,Wow. What a great night.
2005,Sheldon,Youngest till the cyborgs rise up!
2006,Sheldon,How do you know this isn’t a sting operation set up by the Comic-Con police?
2007,Sheldon,They did.
2008,Raj,Ah yes Dr Patel good man.
2009,Sheldon,Very well. I will agree to a family-friendly G-rated boy-girl sleepover.
2010,Sheldon,You’re upset. The convention is to bring an upset person a hot beverage.
2011,Leonard,Well we did it.
2012,Penny,Hey can I ask you a question? You’ve been married for a while is it normal for the husband to kind of completely stop giving a crap?
2013,Sheldon,This has nothing to do with religion. This has to do with the fact that you’re a tiny tiny man who still lives with his mother.
2014,Sheldon,Oh good. Hi Mom. How are you? But Mom she keeps sitting in my spot. And and she touched my food. Okay yes I took her clothes but she started it. No that’s not fair. Why should I have to apologize? Yeah I really don’t think this is the kind of thing Jesus concerns himself with. No you’re right I don’t really know what Jesus thinks about. All right good-bye. Did you tell on me?
2015,Howard,‘Cause that’s what little matzo balls do.
2016,Raj,Great.
2017,Leonard,One of them’s upstairs. The other one sort of slipped back into my skull.
2018,Raj,Dude I am so sorry.
2019,Raj,Please wait until I get into the hall.
2020,Sheldon,Well…
2021,Raj,Sorry.
2022,Leonard,Sorry?
2023,Sheldon,There’s no reason to bring my looks into this. Good day Leonard.
2024,Raj,Look at that. I got a date with Penny. I can’t believe it took you a whole year.
2025,Sheldon,I’m in a great mood.
2027,Leonard,Amy how long would it take for that mad cow disease to kill me?
2028,Raj,But after the cantina scene.
2029,Sheldon,You know in the future when we’re disembodied brains in jars we’re going to look back on this as eight hours well wasted.
2030,Sheldon,Let’s see my armies are going to attack the Shire from Buckland. And I roll a five and a three.
2031,Raj,It’s been around for years. It’s like folk music but with a sci-fi/fantasy theme.
2032,Penny,It’s out of order.
2033,Howard,Whatever dude. She kissed me.
2034,Penny,Our tango?
2035,Leonard,Yep.
2036,Leonard,What is it?
2037,Leonard,I just took him for shoes.
2038,Sheldon,That game? Excuse me Penny but Doodle Jump is a game. Angry Birds is a game. World of Warcraft is a massively multi-player online role-playing… all right technically it’s a game.
2039,Raj,Oh Leonard you remind me of the funny old story about a man who walks into a women’s correctional institution with a stack of paperwork that will allow the female convicts to go free.
2040,Penny,Look at us. What are we doing?
2041,Leonard,A lackey?
2042,Howard,Not that I can think of.
2043,Penny,Yeah.
2044,Howard,He’s right. A minute on the lips a lifetime on the hips.
2045,Penny,That’s better.
2046,Howard,Of course. I’m always packing. Anyway um I had trouble putting it on and you tried to help and that was all she wrote.
2047,Sheldon,I know. You know I almost died in a fire in Des Moines but I stayed put. FYI that’s when the Imodium gave out.
2048,Sheldon,Here’s an interesting fact about flags.
2049,Penny,Born and raised. 
2050,Sheldon,Remember how Leonard told you we couldn’t come to your performance because we were attending a symposium on molecular positronium?
2051,Howard,I don’t put pepper on salads.
2052,Penny,Who cares?
2053,Sheldon,You know a number of significant innovations have been inspired by science fiction. The the geosynchronous satellite from Arthur C. Clarke. The Motorola flip phone that came from Star Trek. And I’ve long suspected that the idea of an African-American president was stolen from the movie Deep Impact.
2054,Penny,Hmm.
2055,Sheldon,Wrong. Leonard?
2056,Raj,It’s nice to see you taking an interest in Amy’s work.
2057,Howard,Of course of course. Now when you say look after you mean…
2058,Howard,Ooh. Okay let’s hope one of the clues is written on a pair of clean underwear.
2059,Sheldon,If you want to lure me in with sexy talk that’s how you do it.
2060,Howard,Ooh how far into the future?
2061,Leonard,No no no I can do it.
2062,Howard,He’s coming. Screen saver.
2063,Raj,Great. That makes one of you. Okay we have a lot to do and not much time to do it. Bernadette you’re on corn gravy and yam detail. Amy you’re on rolls cranberries and making sure Bernadette stays away from the marshmallows. That’s right I see you. Okay if you have any questions I’ll be over here basting my ass off. Focus is key.
2064,Leonard,Yeah. You ought to come out with us sometime.
2065,Penny,Yeah I mean he tried to explain it to me I didn’t really understand it but…
2066,Penny,Like you talked to me about your gaming room?
2067,Raj,Got it.
2068,Leonard,Oh like yesterday when you made me drive you to the dry cleaners the pharmacy and the post office?
2069,Sheldon,I do. You clear on the shampoo issue?
2070,Leonard,Uh uh does it at least pay well?
2071,Leonard,You know that’s the first time you ever said that you love me.
2072,Howard,That’s okay. A complaint has been filed. So that’s it. That was my last hope. I’m going to be deported sent home in disgrace exposed to the sardonic barbs of my cousin Sanjay. Or as you may know him Dave from AT&T customer service.
2073,Leonard,Oh I’ve got it. How about if we replace panels A B and F and crossbar H with aircraft grade aluminium.
2074,Sheldon,Pop-Pop was the only one in my family who encouraged me to pursue science. But you didn’t bring him back did you? No instead I got Lincoln Logs. Well you can build a lot of neat things out of Lincoln Logs but Pop-Pop ain’t one of ’em. And now you’re here asking me for something to save you. Well sorry Mr. Kringle but today’s not your day. I’m leaving you here to rot and I hope the ogres feast on your bones. I take the skeleton key and I toss it into the chasm and on the way out I give Santa a swift kick in his bowl full of jelly!
2075,Leonard,That’s my best friend.
2076,Leonard,So yeah good to see you.
2077,Leonard,What alibi?
2078,Penny,Oh I get it like C3PO. What happened to me?
2079,Howard,Okay. You ladies have fun tonight.
2080,Raj,Any chance you could send me a PDF of that playbook?
2081,Sheldon,Good. See how it’s done Leonard?
2083,Penny,No I do. I didn’t write superfluid helium on this napkin for nothing.
2084,Leonard,You know what? I am tired of living in fear of this guy. I’m gonna go see him and finally say all the things I should have said in high school. You know pick on someone your own size you did not have sex with my mother and yes I do know why I’m hitting myself.”
2085,Raj,Why would I lose friends just because I started dating someone?
2086,Howard,What? Why?
2087,Leonard,That a bunch of awkward scientists with no social skills would invent a machine to do it for them?
2089,Leonard,Oh I don’t think she’s a whore.
2090,Sheldon,Yay.
2091,Leonard,Uh. That is a beautiful tapestry.
2092,Sheldon,Great news. My mom sent me my old Nintendo 64.
2093,Penny,Yeah it’s okay. Go ahead.
2094,Sheldon,Oh yes? Well before I respond let me ask you a question. Is your mother a good or poor bowler?
2095,Leonard,Oh before I forget Saturday I’m planning a little Dungeons and Dragons night with the guys.
2096,Leonard,Maybe a little.
2097,Sheldon,Can’t you surprise him in some other way? For example I’m sure he’d be delightfully taken aback if you cleaned your apartment.
2098,Leonard,What I’m trying to say is that maybe you can’t approach this as a purely intellectual exercise.
2099,Leonard,I try to hide it in his peanut butter but he spits it out.
2100,Penny,You know on our first date Leonard used a coupon to buy me a pretzel.
2101,Sheldon,Okay.  R-E-S-P-E-C-T. No.
2103,Sheldon,So from now on this program will be officially known as Dr. Sheldon Cooper and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present Dr. Sheldon’ Cooper’s Fun With Flags.
2104,Leonard,Hello.
2105,Leonard,Why don’t you enlighten me?
2106,Sheldon,Well Menelaus was the brother of Agamemnon…
2107,Howard,How hard did she stomp?
2108,Howard,What is it to you?
2109,Sheldon,Hearing unimpaired good.
2110,Leonard,Well never have I ever used Sheldon’s toothbrush to clean the sink.
2111,Leonard,Let’s go.
2112,Sheldon,Um…
2113,Sheldon,You mean like a sweater?
2114,Leonard,What do I mean? Boy that’s a toughie.
2115,Raj,I’m happy for you Sheldon. But I have to admit I’m going to miss sharing an office with you.
2116,Howard,You know we’re both down on our luck. Maybe you and I should try to get a place together.
2117,Leonard,I don’t know about this Howard.
2118,Howard,Please this is my way of thanking you for letting me stay here. Now tell us all about your day.
2120,Sheldon,Would you care for a brandy?
2121,Penny,Okay there’s no space in the white zone so…
2123,Howard,I didn’t ask you to set me up with Lakshmi.
2124,Howard,Maybe I can go with you guys to Houston?
2125,Penny,I feel like you guys just went to Comic-Con.
2126,Sheldon,Had a rough night. I thought I’d go for a walk and clear my head.
2127,Sheldon,Oh I had to take the bus home. Fell asleep and missed my stop.
2128,Leonard,Nothing. I love it.
2129,Leonard,Yeah the wait is finally over.
2130,Leonard,Does it have a camera in it?
2131,Raj,Oh.
2132,Penny,Can we go now?
2133,Penny,No no occasion just felt like getting some Chinese chow for my peeps.
2134,Howard,Yeah you can pick your wardrobe. You can even choose your accessories.
2135,Howard,I stopped on the way to work. Hey do you want to peel the plastic off with me?
2136,Howard,Shall I wait?
2137,Sheldon,I’ve been thinking about our recent humiliation.
2138,Raj,No. People just keep kicking me out everywhere I go.
2139,Raj,It’s not gonna work dude I grew up in India an entire subcontinent where cows walk in the street and nobody has ever had a solid bowel movement.
2140,Leonard,Cover for me.
2141,Raj,Oh my God I’m crying already.
2142,Sheldon,Well then I’ll make this quick. Um I want to talk about the paper you sent Leonard. Now I know he said it’s promising and he’s going to collaborate on it but now that you and I are friends again I am at your disposal. And um frankly lending my name and reputation to it will help because a lot of people think that you’re a washed-up has-been. Or dead.
2143,Penny,How’s that?
2144,Raj,Peer review? It’s People magazine. People picked me.
2145,Sheldon,Enjoyed a delightful dinner at a reasonable price. The manager recognized Wil and let us sit right next to the frozen yoghurt machine. Right next to it. I was closer to it than I am to you right now.
2146,Sheldon,I own nine pairs of pants.
2147,Leonard,You don’t have to come if you don’t want to.
2148,Penny,Seriously?
2149,Penny,Oh I don’t know Sheldon it’s going to take me a while to recover from all the fun I had today.
2150,Howard,And we’re blending and we’re blending and we’re done.
2151,Sheldon,Boy you’re wound awfully tight for a man who just had sexual intercourse.
2152,Leonard,You know I can really do this by myself.
2153,Sheldon,No of course not.
2154,Leonard,Oh my God is she okay?
2155,Leonard,If you’re cranky and retaining water I have a theory.
2156,Raj,I don’t think that’s possible dude.
2157,Raj,Oh Penny I hurt so bad.
2158,Sheldon,Sure.
2159,Raj,I think we both know if I come over we’re gonna get back together and…
2160,Sheldon,Really?
2161,Sheldon,I do. After I make them go back and watch one through five first.
2162,Leonard,Yeah. Turns out they guard the iPods but they don’t guard the shirts.
2163,Leonard,Oh that was just because my mother got in my head. It’s like being possessed but instead of Satan it’s actually it’s the same thing.
2164,Sheldon,Stop that.
2165,Sheldon,But I’m not.
2166,Howard,Hey guys check it out. The deluxe limited edition Wild West and Witches expansion pack in the signed and numbered collector’s tin.
2167,Sheldon,Hey Leonard if you’re happy and you know it no need to clap your hands because I have an emotion detector.
2168,Sheldon,Oh it turns out Amy’s beloved Pride and Prejudice is a flawless masterpiece. He’s got too much pride she’s got too much prejudice it just works.
2169,Howard,That’s wonderful. A lawyer my sister’s a lawyer. Look at that we have something in common.
2170,Howard,Thanks.
2171,Penny,Leonard might come home can we talk in my apartment.
2172,Leonard,Sounds rough.
2173,Sheldon,Leonard when that woman moved in three years ago I told you not to talk to her and now look we’re going to be late for the movies.
2174,Sheldon,Nope.
2175,Sheldon,I already am. I’m bringing the gift of knowledge.
2176,Howard,That is weird. I thought he was like 45.
2177,Raj,Of course. I’ll give you guys some space. Let me just get this out of your way.
2178,Leonard,Oh yeah no sure go ahead.
2179,Raj,I suppose you could have your android penis circumcised. But that’s something your Rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturers.
2180,Penny,I know.
2181,Penny,Okay.
2182,Leonard,There isn’t any ranking. And if there were we wouldn’t be at the bottom of it.
2183,Sheldon,I most certainly did not.
2184,Leonard,So how do you wanna do this?
2185,Leonard,I know. Sometimes Howard wears a striped shirt so we can play Where’s Wolowitz? Okay now This is us camping out in line for the Avengers panel.
2186,Penny,Hey.
2187,Sheldon,You tracked my phone?
2188,Howard,Could you say that in English? I actually I never learned Hindi.
2189,Sheldon,Hello. Hello. Uh uh uh four glasses of water please. Anything for you guys?
2190,Howard,With your sales record you have nothing to worry about.
2191,Penny,No it’s not. I mean what’s thoughtful is everything you do. Here you know what? Look at this. Look here’s the the plane ticket you bought me when I was too poor to go home for the holidays. And the rose you left on my windshield just because. Here’s the the thank-you letter you wrote me after the first time I slept with you. All 11 pages of it.
2192,Sheldon,There.
2193,Leonard,Good good. I’ll tell you what happens.
2194,Sheldon,Thank you. Can we just talk about something else?
2195,Leonard,Yeah if you want us to look like losers.
2196,Leonard,No no. Listen um once upon a time there was this shoemaker and when he went to bed at night elves would sneak in and they would make all these amazing shoes for him. And when the shoemaker woke up in the morning he he would be super happy not mad at the elves at all. Open it.
2197,Penny,Sheldon why are you ignoring your sister?
2198,Howard,What are you guys up to?
2199,Sheldon,Yes it’s just that in all the years I’ve known him he’s never had the opportunity to receive my admiration. I was excited to see the look on his face when it finally happened.
2200,Sheldon,Excuse me little idea?
2201,Leonard,Hey.
2202,Leonard,Okay you may have to pretend you’re black to get us out of here.
2203,Leonard,Come on. We’re a couple of smart guys. I’m sure we can come up with a way to explain this that doesn’t make us look bad.
2204,Howard,Way to bust out the Jedi mind tricks dude.
2205,Leonard,You’re being ridiculous.
2206,Leonard,Okay he must be in his bedroom. My spare glasses are in my bedroom on my dresser next to my Bat-signal.
2207,Howard,Say again.
2208,Penny,Hi. I thought you went to the comic book store on Wednesdays.
2209,Leonard,I wonder a lot of things about you Sheldon but not… not that.
2210,Leonard,Why what’s so unusual about me having a date?
2211,Howard,Excuse me. I’m going to go wander the streets alone. Invisible unwanted and unloved a pathetic shadow in a city with no heart.  I forgot my windbreaker. It’s chilly.
2212,Howard,And you think that’s going to help?
2213,Raj,You know that hurts my feelings.
2214,Sheldon,I’ll be right back. Feel free to play with yourself.
2215,Leonard,Mm you know we could throw a dinner party too. Maybe even ask everyone to get dressed up.
2216,Sheldon,Oh of course. Set phasers to dumb right?  It’s only logical.
2217,Leonard,Really?
2218,Sheldon,Not pistols. Minds. A trivia contest and you may choose the field of battle. Star Trek trivia Star Trek Next Generation trivia Star Trek Deep Space Nine trivia Star Trek Voyager trivia or model trains.
2219,Leonard,What? Oh we just had to… mail some letters and 
2220,Raj,That depends do they have Mexican food in Cuba?
2221,Leonard,Guys what are we doing? We sent the girls away so we could focus.
2222,Howard,You want me to work with you?
2223,Raj,Nonsense. You need a little fattening up. You’ve been looking too skinny lately.
2224,Penny,You know what? I can honestly say if we fall in love not only will I drive you there I will buy you all the dragon T-shirts you want.
2225,Sheldon,Amy’s right. He is tedious.
2226,Howard,It’s Koothrappali. I have to tinkle.
2227,Penny,You know it is normal to want to change your look after a breakup.
2228,Penny,Why do you even care? Just tell us what it says.
2229,Howard,Fine. Paint green flames on your little scooter with her. 
2230,Raj,All right guys what game do you want to play?
2231,Penny,Oh okay alright well thank you for coming.
2232,Raj,Wow. You’re going off to work with the military leaving me behind. Now I know how all those army wives feel.
2234,Leonard,One of the people that lives in his head.
2235,Sheldon,I’m just so… full.
2236,Howard,How about that!
2237,Howard,Hey Stuart come on in.
2238,Penny,Leonard Leonard? I cannot believe we were missing that jerk.
2239,Leonard,Sheldon.
2240,Raj,Actually I was going to suggest me.
2241,Leonard,Penny but…
2242,Sheldon,Leonard.
2243,Leonard,Alright and Raj.
2244,Raj,For me it was a bonding moment.
2246,Raj,Dude that movie’s an imperialist fantasy that makes the followers of a beautiful and peaceful religion look like a bunch of bloodthirsty barbarians.
2247,Howard,I don’t know. How do you want to start?
2248,Penny,What do you mean?
2249,Sheldon,Your surprise confuses me. I live here.
2250,Leonard,Aw.
2251,Penny,Is that friend Wolowitz?
2252,Leonard,Are you saying that my dad’s not good enough for your mom?
2253,Sheldon,No. He died when I was 14.
2254,Raj,No.
2255,Leonard,Counterpoint no it’s not.
2256,Sheldon,Fine.
2257,Leonard,Oh maybe we shouldn’t bother him.
2258,Penny,Okay that is the lamest excuse you could’ve possibly come up with. But I get it.
2259,Leonard,I got you the lamb kabob.
2260,Penny,Okay alright moving on oh wow a paisley shirt.
2261,Sheldon,I need to measure my fluid intake and output to make sure my kidneys aren’t shutting down.
2262,Raj,I’m sorry?
2263,Leonard,Buddy I’m so sorry. Is there anything I can do?
2264,Penny,I think I hate all of you nerds.
2265,Leonard,You did go pfft.
2266,Sheldon,I’m so disappointed in myself. Jealousy is completely illogical.
2267,Howard,Please sit. I uh I got you a cappuccino. I remembered it was your favourite. I also got crumb cake but I remembered it was my favourite and I ate it. Anyway uh how are you?
2268,Leonard,Maybe I’m not done hanging out with…  You’re right it’s getting late.
2269,Leonard,Sheldon.
2270,Leonard,I did not burst into tears my eyes just got a little watery.
2271,Penny,Okay Sheldon you are so wrong. That is not even close to the real number. I’m gonna need a drink over here.
2272,Sheldon,I suppose so.
2273,Sheldon,Without shoes?
2274,Raj,Howard and Bernadette the five of us stand before you as your friends and newly ordained ministers.
2275,Leonard,Come on Dennis I’ll show you the radiation lab.
2276,Sheldon,Well if x equals the amount that you’ll miss me then I’ll miss you x plus one.
2277,Raj,The guy who invented it says it’s jif.
2278,Sheldon,I got my job back.
2279,Sheldon,Well I started the list when I was nine.
2280,Leonard,Hey Penny. this is Alicia our new neighbour.
2281,Sheldon,It’s been around for 25 years and has been extensively corroborated by other researchers.
2282,Howard,Uh no water’s fine. Anyhow I’ve been thinking about it a lot and and I totally see why Lucy did what she did. I pushed too hard. But you know what? If I back off and give her enough space maybe there’s still a future for us. Yeah the funny thing about life is that you know sometimes…
2283,Sheldon,Those are your Jedi robes.
2284,Leonard,Oh I know his password so I can track his phone.
2285,Sheldon,Yeah I have to say it is nice to share this experience with someone who’s on the same journey. Although right now ours is testing off the charts while yours is floating around in its own waste.
2286,Sheldon,The problem appears to be unsolvable.
2287,Sheldon,You don’t have to be mean. I’m sick.
2288,Raj,Hey guys check it out. The deluxe limited edition Wild West and Witches expansion pack in the signed and numbered collector’s tin.
2289,Leonard,Look at me go.
2290,Howard,Hey Stuart. What are you doing here?
2291,Raj,Uh turn left here and see if he turns with us.
2292,Leonard,Yeah I’m proud of him too.
2293,Penny,It means instead of having a week to study I only have two days.
2294,Leonard,I’d look pretty stupid if there was no music.
2295,Howard,Why did Howard leave you in the middle of the road anyway?
2296,Sheldon,The one with the frogs.
2297,Raj,In fact it’s better if you don’t otherwise it makes the rest of us look bad.
2298,Leonard,Oh yeah. It’s just a little motorcycle accident.
2299,Penny,Oh my God would you let this go?!
2300,Howard,It’s my sister. Can we not talk about this any more?
2301,Sheldon,No.
2302,Penny,Yes.
2303,Raj,Yeah I get that. I’m a scientist slash party planner slash small-dog enthusiast slash guy who probably should have stopped at scientist.
2305,Leonard,It’s ten o’clock where have you been?
2306,Sheldon,Amy from time to time we men need to break free from the shackles of civility and get in touch with our primal animalistic selves.
2307,Leonard,It is pretty spicy.
2309,Sheldon,Maybe we’re better off. What if we were to get in a car with a crazy person?
2310,Raj,What’s going on? Oh. Wait. On. And off. What’s going on?
2311,Penny,What I was seeking was some sort of friendship. But at this point I’ll take you not insulting me to my face.
2312,Penny,Thanks. You guys are really sweet.
2313,Sheldon,Oh I will nothing more fun than a paradigm-shifting evening of science.
2314,Raj,I may be moving out soon. I think I found a place to live.
2315,Leonard,Uh.
2316,Leonard,I’ve been listening to Sheldon’s feelings on things for ten years. Tag you’re it.
2317,Raj,Uurgh.
2318,Sheldon,Leonard you’re my best friend. Why don’t you ever take my side?
2319,Howard,You know what would be fun? Signing Sheldon up for online dating.
2320,Howard,Oh I’m not on the patent. I’m just here because there’s a bumblebee in my office.
2321,Raj,Excuse me I think how could you she’s my sister takes precedence over a five year old pinky swear!
2322,Leonard,You bought her a ring?
2323,Penny,No no no no no. It is on. I am gonna introduce your friend to a world of hurt.
2324,Penny,Well it’s not that sweet I paid for the frame with your money and then got a massage.
2325,Raj,What do you mean not again?
2326,Sheldon,Hello I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
2327,Penny,No problem. We just sat down.
2328,Sheldon,Well you know I’ve always been a fan of a story told by Attar of Nishapur about a king who assembled a group of wise men to create a ring that would make him happy when he was sad. And that ring was inscribed with the phrase this too shall pass.
2329,Sheldon,Yes.
2330,Leonard,I know but when I shop online I can do it on the toilet.
2331,Raj,Excuse me Ganesh is the remover of obstacles and Shiva is the destroyer. When the smoke clears Abraham Lincoln will be speaking Hindi and drinking mint juleps.
2332,Howard,I don’t understand. Why is it bad that you have to teach?
2333,Raj,No no no don’t say that. You’re going to be all right.
2334,Leonard,I always wanted to be a swashbuckler when I was a kid.
2335,Leonard,Howard lives with his mother and Raj can’t speak to women unless he’s drunk. Go.
2336,Penny,I have to take notes?
2337,Raj,Wait a minute. Hey let me see your phone.
2338,Penny,Oh come on! A smart guy like you it’ll be a challenge. You can make it like an experiment.
2339,Raj,Oh okay how about this. You can go dressed as a Star Trek science officer exploring a planet similar to Earth in the 1500s.
2340,Leonard,Okay let’s go see your psychic.
2341,Penny,No! No! No. Let’s just all finish our dinners okay?
2342,Sheldon,Uh but this is violating university code.
2343,Raj,Or we could walk right behind each other all night and look like one person going really fast.
2344,Penny,Hey.
2345,Sheldon,I had a bad dream that my best friend became a tyrant and forced me to stay up all night to work.
2346,Sheldon,Oh if that were only true. Unfortunately as I’m earthbound for the foreseeable future I need to find a location that’s more hospitable than the mean streets of Pasadena. Like Enid Oklahoma. Low crime rate and high-speed Internet connectivity but no model train shops. Sorry Enid.
2347,Penny,I believe I quoted Empire Strikes Back.
2348,Sheldon,If our friend the flag has taught me anything it’s to go where the wind takes you. As long as you remain firmly attached to a rigid pole. And action. So Penny what sort of flag questions keep you awake at night?
2349,Leonard,At least I have an egg. What do you have?
2350,Leonard,Well honey not to complain but we were starting to think you didn’t either.
2351,Penny,Great how?
2352,Raj,Hey I read that someone invented a way to convert your footsteps into electromagnetic energy so you can charge your cell phone while walking.
2353,Howard,You still might get on a magazine.
2354,Sheldon,I do not. But if you insist on decorating a spider-infested fire hazard in my home I would request that you add this.
2355,Sheldon,He sounds like a sociopath.
2356,Leonard,Yeah no I got it.
2357,Sheldon,All right way to go Cat Poster. You hang in there.
2358,Howard,Yeah well I don’t like bugs okay? They freak me out.
2359,Penny,I’m kidding.
2360,Leonard,Oshikuru Demon Samurai.
2361,Howard,Religion is a very personal thing. I do go to temple I just I don’t talk about it.
2362,Leonard,Oh I like to laugh. But say it anyway.
2363,Leonard,Why? Because I got an ugly itchy sweater and my brother got a car? No I was her favorite.
2364,Leonard,Okay well then I’ll just cut your vines with my ruby sword. That’s right I did it. I cut ’em.
2365,Penny,Hello Sheldon.
2367,Leonard,So you decided to get the whole Manhattan Project?
2369,Sheldon,Yes exactly. Consequently if Amy and I choose to bring new life into this world it will be accomplished clinically with fertility experts in a lab with petri dishes. Which reminds me you have broad hips and a certain corn-fed vigour. Is your womb available for rental?
2370,Howard,Maybe your nickname should be Brown Dynamite.
2371,Leonard,Uh she’s my mother. You know her?
2372,Sheldon,Come on you can’t wait two minutes?
2373,Sheldon,You mean my ring?
2374,Penny,But on the other hand if things don’t go well with Leonard I risk losing a really good friend. I mean I guess he’s not looking for a fling he’s the kind of guy that gets into a relationship for I don’t know like you would say light years.
2375,Penny,Oh I’m judging you nine ways to Sunday but you don’t owe me an explanation.
2376,Leonard,You can try but nobody’s gonna believe you. I just I don’t understand how you can watch a show that great and not be excited by it.
2377,Penny,Oh. You might want to put a sign on it.
2378,Howard,Yeah Star Trek V worse than I.
2379,Howard,It’s true. I’m always attracted to women I can’t have. I do it all the time. I did the same thing with the two of you.
2380,Raj,Are you not looking at me? I am Brown Dynamite. Why do you put six sugars in your coffee?
2381,Penny,Grab your hammer.
2382,Sheldon,Leonard please we can talk during our break. We have one coming up at midnight. We’ll need snacks.
2383,Raj,Sure. Mmm. Bossa nova. You listen to that with your hips as well as your ears.
2384,Howard,Just making conversation. Mummy daddy I want you to meet my new squeeze Penny.
2385,Sheldon,It’s actually based on very sound theories his mother published a paper on it.
2386,Howard,Yeah okay Howard wins.
2387,Sheldon,So did you do that or am I in the house with an intruder?
2388,Penny,Your home is twenty feet from here.
2389,Howard,We are now.
2390,Sheldon,Interesting. Anyway that gives us a total weight of let’s say 4400lb.
2391,Sheldon,Hello I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. My apologies that this episode is coming late. I did shoot one last week in honour of Black History Month but I was informed by my roommate that my spot-on portrayal of George Washington Carver could be considered wildly racist. My heart goes out to the members of the African-American community who like me have been kept down by The Man. Now Fun with Flags is not just for the flag aficionado it’s also for the flag novice so to help me with that please welcome my friend neighbour and flag virgin yeah not a real virgin. She’s had coitus many times. Sometimes within earshot of this flag enthusiast. Once while he was trying to watch The Incredibles. Penny.
2392,Sheldon,Hello.
2393,Sheldon,Yeah I am indeed. I have decided instead of wallowing in sadness about Amy it is time that I find myself a new female companion.
2394,Leonard,Well it’s not silly if you think of that group as being led by a big evil baby.
2395,Raj,Hey.
2396,Raj,Yeah thank you! This means a lot to me. My friends are like my family. Unless you don’t like them in which case they’re dead to me.
2397,Raj,Hey.
2398,Penny,No no. Let’s mix things up. I choose Sheldon and we’re gonna kick your ass!
2399,Howard,So Missy. Have you ever met a man from the exotic subcontinent of India?
2400,Leonard,We just wanted to hang out with you and maybe learn a little about your life.
2401,Raj,What? You slept with my sister?
2402,Leonard,What’s with the fish?
2403,Penny,Shut up.
2404,Sheldon,I was valedictorian and expected to give an address. Even now I can remember that moment when I walked up to the podium and looked out at the crowd. There must have been thousands of people. My heart started pounding in my chest. I began to hyperventilate. My vision became blurry and before I knew it… oh dear. 
2405,Penny,Do you actually pay for that haircut?
2406,Penny,No no we’re not playing some dumb made-up game.
2408,Leonard,You’re just sweaty from exercise.
2409,Raj,What was that?
2410,Penny,Oh there you go again just another mistake you’re throwing in my face.
2411,Leonard,Also instead of just living in your mother’s house you could actually live inside her body.
2412,Penny,So let me get this straight. You just assumed my paper would be bad so you wrote one for me?
2413,Raj,That would be amazing. I was literally just looking at my moving boxes trying to pick one to live in.
2414,Sheldon,And so instead of bowing to pressure and going to that pointless soiree I stayed right here and did a load of whites.
2415,Leonard,Fine. You invited your drug dealer brother to stay with us for God knows how long and didn’t bother to ask me first.
2417,Sheldon,I’m at a loss. If you like you can review my daily log of social interactions and see if there’s a blunder I overlooked.
2418,Penny,Well it just slipped out. I feel terrible.
2419,Leonard,You know like most of the time you’re the easygoing Bruce Banner but then when you get angry you kind of turn into like you know grrrrr!
2420,Raj,I think we should talk.
2421,Leonard,Yeah that’s very comforting.
2422,Leonard,Come on we should go.
2423,Raj,So who’s up for a movie?
2424,Leonard,You all right?
2425,Leonard,Why?
2426,Howard,Oh well nice to meet you.
2427,Sheldon,Why?
2428,Sheldon,You know I am very disappointed that I won’t be able to celebrate Howard’s accomplishment tonight.
2429,Penny,How could he do that.
2431,Leonard,Yeah Penny might be onto something.
2432,Penny,Oh Sheldon!
2433,Raj,Really?
2434,Penny,Well no not per se but…
2435,Penny,Sheldon you are right. I’m really sorry. I should’ve known better.
2436,Howard,No no. Uh you’ve always wanted to send your food back in a restaurant here’s your chance.
2437,Penny,Yeah well your ken can kiss my Barbie.
2439,Leonard,Yeah well before they went out of business I bought 4000 containers. I keep them in the trunk of my car.
2440,Penny,The one from whom I live across the hall from.
2441,Howard,You can dance to this. Um uh uh Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning the other plays with bones.
2442,Howard,When we tell this story let’s end it differently.
2443,Penny,Kinda sorta had to?
2444,Sheldon,I’m taking a sabbatical because I won’t kow-tow to mediocre minds.
2445,Howard,Yeah me too. We’ve got more important things to do. Who cares what stupid forty-three means?
2446,Leonard,Yes.
2447,Leonard,I’m not the fish.
2448,Howard,Well I’m a Hindu. My religion teaches that if we suffer in this life we are rewarded in the next. Three months at the North Pole with Sheldon and I’m reborn as a well-hung billionaire with wings!
2449,Penny,Okay you know what? I give up. I’m going to bed.
2450,Howard,Aha.
2451,Sheldon,Soon. See I could’ve said in the near future but I didn’t say in the near future because in the near future is three more words than soon. In one the two near three future four. See in the near future is four soon is just one four is more than one saving time already.
2452,Penny,Okay. You know what? I changed my mind. I’m not going.
2453,Sheldon,I’m sorry. I just don’t buy it.
2454,Penny,Thank you.
2455,Sheldon,So you’re saying you wouldn’t leave me for the chance to be one of the first humans to colonize another planet?
2456,Penny,Thank you.
2457,Howard,Leonard please. The man is talking. Let him get it out and let the chips fall where they may.
2458,Sheldon,I’m sorry did I wake you?
2459,Penny,Uncomfortable.
2460,Sheldon,Oh! Not this again.
2461,Sheldon,There’s Neosporin and Band-Aids in my top desk drawer.
2462,Leonard,And sorry about the suitcase.
2463,Leonard,Almost there almost there almost there. 
2464,Howard,Mmm Greek food on pizza night? This is the most delightfully cruel thing we’ve done to Sheldon since we left that fake message from Stephen Hawking on his voice mail.
2466,Penny,If it makes you uncomfortable I’ll switch partners even though the thing’s due next week and everyone already has a partner and I’ll probably end up failing the class.
2468,Penny,Yeah let’s see. Uh four Under the Seas two Enchanted Evenings and one Night to Remember that I cannot remember for the life of me.
2469,Sheldon,Hugh people need to listen to me. It’s time to get in line for the movie. And that’s how you tell a knock-knock joke.
2470,Sheldon,Oh. Oh and every other day check the water level on the avocado pit.
2471,Sheldon,All right. There’s a female.
2473,Raj,I’ll do it.
2474,Penny,If we drop them off at a fire station they have to take them no questions asked.
2475,Sheldon,Wolowitz?
2476,Howard,So I did a little research on what the conditions are like in the mines and the guys might be right sounds pretty rough down there. For starters it’s very humid and about a hundred degrees.
2477,Sheldon,Penny.
2478,Leonard,You have a will?
2479,Penny,Oh honey did your mom not have the talk with you? You know when your private parts started growing?
2480,Penny,Um actually can we do it in private?
2481,Sheldon,And on a different but not unrelated topic based on your current efforts to buoy my spirits do you truly believe that you were ever fit to be a cheer leader?
2482,Raj,Wow. An end of an era.
2483,Leonard,How so?
2484,Howard,No thank you.
2485,Penny,You two want to be alone?
2486,Leonard,Four months.
2487,Howard,Hey Sheldon?
2488,Raj,She said she didn’t want to see me any more and I found that insulting.
2489,Leonard,He’s asking if we can come as anyone from science-fiction fantasy…
2490,Penny,Oh Dan. My boss who didn’t want to hire me and now’s a little hug machine.
2491,Howard,And the worst sign of all is you’re here and not there.
2492,Penny,Uh good. Is Mom around?
2493,Penny,Well now I wish I had the ability to make that stuff easier for you.
2494,Leonard,You know how they say when friends have sex it can get weird?
2495,Leonard,Oh how’d it go at the mechanic?
2496,Howard,Oh my goodness.
2497,Howard,All right let’s buckle down and work.
2498,Leonard,So go to the bathroom.
2499,Raj,Say again.
2500,Raj,Okay I know what I’m going to do.
2501,Sheldon, Here. I had to trade the others for my life.
2502,Sheldon,What are you doing?
2503,Sheldon,That’s not afternoon. That’s preevning.
2504,Leonard,Can you tell I’m perspiring a little?
2505,Sheldon,Because you’ve been training for this your whole life. You live in a pile of dirty laundry.
2506,Sheldon,Wow. No wonder you didn’t get that toothpaste commercial.
2507,Sheldon,Yeah.
2508,Sheldon,I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can.
2509,Leonard,No I think it’s a firmware problem.
2510,Sheldon,Please tell me you’re not having coitus.
2511,Sheldon,A housewarming gift for Raj.
2512,Leonard,Really so why did you come?
2513,Penny,Here’s some champagne.
2514,Sheldon,Well now don’t be surprised if like Star Trek it’s cancelled in three.
2515,Sheldon,What would constitute a perfect day for you?
2517,Leonard,Hey.
2518,Howard,What did they give you?
2519,Raj,No come on please don’t leave.
2521,Howard,Kites ho!
2522,Sheldon,What do you want to talk about?
2523,Penny,Well it’s been fun.
2524,Penny,Okay. What do you want Sheldon?
2525,Sheldon,Yeah yeah we’ll be right there. Leonard?
2526,Sheldon,And I have flag knowledge that I have to get out of here!
2527,Leonard,What do you think about giving Sheldon’s ticket to Stuart?
2528,Penny,I feel like I should say damn.
2529,Leonard,Yeah well  Sheldon’s still up.
2530,Raj,We can but for the record all chaps are assless.
2531,Sheldon,Oh you think you’re so clever. Well let me just tell you while I do not currently have a scathing retort you check your e-mail periodically for a doozy.
2532,Penny,Oh sweetie you are so not the guy.
2533,Sheldon,Maybe you should put on your Juicy pants again.
2534,Raj,You’re useless.
2535,Sheldon,I miss you too.
2536,Leonard,It’s a little hard to explain. He does this thing where he pretends he’s in an alternate dimension that occupies the same physical space we’re in but he can’t perceive us.
2537,Raj,No you weren’t because it was a week ago and nobody came. So if you want to solve the mystery of who stabbed Koothrappali in the back with the weapon of indifference it was all of you.
2538,Sheldon,Oh sure. Well you’re fun to look at.
2539,Leonard,We don’t need strength we’re physicists. We are the intellectual descendents of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever and I can move the Earth it’s just a matter…  I don’t have this… I don’t have this I don’t have this.
2540,Sheldon,Look at that that’s a dent. Thank you Howard Ham-Fisted Wolowitz. Did you just shut the TV off in the middle of the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode?
2541,Sheldon,When I mixed it with Sheldony goodness and cooked it in the Easy-Bake oven of my mind.
2542,Penny,Oh no. This face wasn’t because I didn’t get it.
2543,Sheldon,No.
2544,Penny,Oh wow you’re actually going out like that?
2545,Raj,Wow. You’re even prettier than Penny said. I can’t believe a girl like you doesn’t have a boyfriend.
2546,Howard,I can’t believe you kissed my sister with moth mouth.
2547,Penny,Hey.
2548,Penny,Well I don’t want to be a jerk but it was kind of a bummer.
2549,Leonard,Okay you run into a room full of weapons hit a trip wire a cannon blows your face off you die you’re out of the game.
2550,Leonard,Yeah. It’s good to see you too. Here you go.
2551,Sheldon,I help the weak. It’s yet another way I’m exactly like Batman.
2552,Penny,Um me okay I’m Sagittarius which probably tells you way more than you need to know.
2553,Leonard,Sir I I I’m sorry but I just don’t get it. You came into our lab in the middle of the night and took our prototype and all of our research and didn’t even tell us?
2554,Leonard,Sheldon’s in jail?
2555,Sheldon,Now see I never would have thought to do that. Clearly I made a good choice farming this out to you. But I am telling you Amy hit the boyfriend jackpot. Anyway my socks are on. Let’s knock them off.
2556,Penny,Not really no.
2557,Sheldon,Suppose I could run downtown and pick up something at Shel-Mart.
2558,Penny,Okay here you go Leonard one tequila sunrise.
2559,Sheldon,Listen to you. How can I possibly go?
2560,Sheldon,Every time you drink alcohol.
2561,Sheldon,Not that it’s any of your business but she broke up with me.
2562,Penny,Okay like what? Show me.
2563,Sheldon,How could he do this to me? Get back here you stupid bird so I can love you!
2564,Leonard,Yes but our society has undergone a paradigm shift in the information age Sheldon you and I are the alpha males. We shouldn’t have to back down.
2565,Howard,Not at all. He’s forgotten how miserable he was the entire time he was up there. It’s like me in those moments when I miss India.
2566,Penny,Sheldon don’t you get it? If this takes off I won’t have to be a waitress anymore.
2567,Sheldon,Well so much for your advice on complimenting Penny.
2568,Leonard,Oh I will. There is no telling what might happen.
2569,Penny,Did you tell her about your lucky asthma inhaler?
2570,Sheldon,But um I did have you. And every day at four o’clock you’d come to my house on Channel 68 and we’d do science together. If it hadn’t been for you well who knows what would’ve become of me? You know? Instead of a world-class physicist I could’ve wound up as a hobo. Or a surgeon.
2571,Leonard,Thank you. Befuddled. The word I was looking for was befuddled.
2572,Penny,You’re not gonna leave me alone until I do it are you?
2573,Sheldon,Wait you have to drive me home.
2574,Raj,Oooh he’s got me.
2575,Leonard,Oh that’s true. It’s not like we can get in there.
2576,Sheldon,Let’s see. Hey I was humming. One point for Hufflepuff. What song is that?
2577,Leonard,Stupid idea.
2578,Leonard,Fine I told Sheldon that her apartment’s been finished but then you just said it’s not so now I’m all confused.
2579,Leonard,Sheldon we’ve been together so long it’s hard to remember a time you weren’t in my life. And believe me I try. You make me laugh. You make me a better scientist. You make me crazy. You’re more than just my roommate you’re my brother.
2580,Sheldon,In principle you have a point but as a practical matter need I remind you that it takes experimental pharmaceuticals to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex.
2581,Howard,I don’t know I’m torn. I want to know where he’s going but now I kind of want to play with the bunny.
2582,Leonard,Wuh what about what you said in the restaurant?
2583,Sheldon,Do you still like cilantro?
2584,Sheldon,Personally I would never use a transporter. Because the original Sheldon would have to be disintegrated in order to create a new Sheldon.
2585,Leonard,The ladies?
2586,Penny,Oh my God that is so creepy!
2587,Leonard,So you’re going to go work at the patent office?
2588,Raj,Yes you are.
2589,Sheldon,Ugh. English pudding. You get yourself all excited for pudding and here comes a cake with raisins in it. I’m not going.
2590,Sheldon,Oh come on it’s fun. Ooh! Another bump. Okay. I’ll say an element and uh you say an element whose name starts with the last letter of the one I said okay? I’ll start. Helium. Now you could say Mercury. That would give me a Y. Ooh.  Very clever that’s a tough one. So I go Ytterbium which gets you back to M. So you go Molybdenum and I say Magnesium you say Manganese and  I say Europium and and you’re left with Mendelevium and  there are no more M’s because I believe that Meitnerium should still be called Ekairidium so congratulations you win. Do you wanna go again?
2591,Penny,What?
2592,Leonard,Yes you are you’re meant to learn how to drive. Please learn how to drive!
2593,Sheldon,I got lost.
2594,Penny,Here you go.
2595,Penny,Leonard hang on. Just come here. Maybe we need to let him go.
2596,Howard,Really? So every other place you’ve been you thought this was fine?
2597,Leonard,I don’t know. Maybe.
2598,Leonard,No you’re coming with me.
2599,Penny,Of course not.
2600,Sheldon,I see no large upcoming expenditures unless they develop an affordable technology to fuse my skeleton with adamantium like Wolverine.
2601,Leonard,Go sit over there.
2602,Penny,Okay well I guess we’re back to the corduroy suit.
2603,Leonard,I know.
2604,Sheldon,Excellent. Excellent. And on a related point you’re going down punk.
2605,Leonard,Oh yeah. Mouth-to-Mouth Mona. You know she used to date Howard?
2606,Leonard,We’re up on the roof bouncing laser beams off the moon.
2607,Leonard,It’s just a little scary.
2608,Raj,I can’t get Emily’s night-stand to close.
2609,Leonard,To the tar pits.
2610,Howard,Emily Hey.
2611,Penny,We’re home.
2612,Raj,Oh okay. I’ll just go home and be alone. Which is cool. I eat alone I sleep alone I cry alone so cool.
2613,Leonard,That’s a lousy conversation starter.
2614,Penny,Look why don’t I play with you guys tomorrow?
2615,Sheldon,On the bright side that Oxford study was right. One friend down. I wonder who you’re going to lose next.
2616,Howard,Before you go at least let me pack you some Attack of the Scones for the road.
2617,Penny,Well yeah we did have a date.
2618,Sheldon,Spaghetti with little pieces of hot dog cut up in it!
2619,Sheldon,With what?
2620,Sheldon,What did he say?
2621,Howard,Oh yay I have a doctorate in astrophysics and I’m every bit as awesome as the pasty-faced owner of a comic book store.
2622,Leonard,Well but don’t a lot of famous actors get their start doing bad movies?
2623,Leonard,Sheldon do you realize I don’t live with the woman I love because of you? No other reason. Just you.
2624,Sheldon,Thank you.
2625,Penny,Really? You guess you’re in?
2626,Penny,What is your problem? Do you use up all your thinking at work and then have none left over for when you get home?
2627,Leonard,Buddy I I think you might be overreacting.
2628,Leonard,Hey Penny. It’s Leonard.
2629,Howard,Oh God never again.
2630,Raj,She built an ice castle made a snow monster and gave herself a complete makeover in one day. You know what I saw you do today? Eat a block of cream cheese straight from the foil and lie about it to your wife.
2631,Sheldon,I swear.
2632,Leonard,Where did you get all this stuff?
2633,Penny,No I mean what you find enjoyable.
2634,Howard,What? Just because I’m Indian I can’t be a Norse God? No no no Raj has to be an Indian God. That’s racism. I mean look at Wolowitz he’s not English but he’s dressed like Peter Pan. Sheldon is neither sound nor light but he’s obviously the Doppler Effect.
2635,Leonard,Morning Sheldon.
2636,Howard,Uh.
2637,Sheldon,Oh. I hadn’t thought about it like that. I wonder if I’ve been experiencing physiological manifestations of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil.
2638,Howard,Oh please. My sister’s much hotter than your girlfriend and you know it.
2639,Leonard,Hey can we please get back to work?
2640,Leonard,So why’d you ask?
2641,Howard,It was just this one time Papa I swear.
2642,Raj,Keep going.
2643,Sheldon,Tears seem appropriate. Enlargement of the heart muscle or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a serious disease which could lead to congestive heart failure.
2644,Leonard,What are you talking about?
2645,Penny,Oh hey hi.
2646,Penny,Drinks do not work that way.
2647,Penny,Thank you.
2648,Sheldon,We don’t have soup.
2649,Leonard,We’re not fighting.
2650,Leonard,Maybe since you’re so good he’s taking his time to meet the challenge. I want Penny to enjoy school…
2651,Sheldon,Wine again? Yeah no thank you. I like my grapes the old-fashioned way in a juice box.
2652,Raj,What can we do?
2653,Sheldon,No it’s not.
2654,Sheldon,Oh dear God.  Leonard! Leonard I’m sick!
2655,Penny,Oh it’s not a date Leonard. It’s just a man and a woman hanging out and not having sex at the end of the night.
2656,Sheldon,Is that why I appear to be in downtown Fallujah behind the wheel of an up-armored Humvee?
2657,Howard,Hey Emily listen I’ve been thinking and I’m not sure it’s a good idea that I come over.
2658,Sheldon,I do not have to urinate. I am the master of my own bladder. Drat.
2659,Leonard,I don’t know. It’s pretty catchy.
2660,Howard,It’s a Christmas miracle.
2661,Sheldon,Uh-oh.
2662,Sheldon,He will he’s really smart.
2663,Penny,Okay. Leonard I really appreciate that but I need a little time to myself.
2664,Sheldon,Well I won’t tolerate deception in my relationship. I have no choice but to confront her.
2665,Sheldon,Oh there are so many exciting areas. Black holes dark matter.
2666,Sheldon,His name is Alfred and yes he does.
2667,Sheldon,Uh wait before we eat I have a little welcome to the building gift for Raj.
2668,Penny,Late? It’s 705.
2669,Penny,But he had already moved on.
2670,Raj,Oh it all comes down to this.
2671,Leonard,No we just made out.
2672,Leonard,So roller skating should we all grab a bite to eat first?
2673,Leonard,Please don’t tell anyone I spent the night with Raj’s sister.
2674,Howard,Your assistant is totally hitting on this jerk and he loves it.
2675,Howard,I’m sorry. This is very sweet. Thanks.
2676,Howard,What does it say?
2677,Raj,‘Cause that’s what we do.
2678,Howard,Sorry. I lost my cool.
2679,Leonard,On the other hand some physicists are concerned that if the super collider actually works it will create a black hole and swallow up the Earth ending life as we know it.
2680,Leonard,I was able to get out of there before anything else happened but she wants to see me again tomorrow night.
2681,Penny,Ooh. I’m gonna get another. You want food?
2683,Sheldon,Abundantly.
2684,Leonard,Okay good luck.
2685,Raj,Then we can be the Bengal Tigers.
2686,Sheldon,This isn’t a very good connection but it sounded like someone just released a kraken.
2687,Sheldon,That’s helpful. Okay. Of these four areas…
2688,Penny,That candle and you.
2689,Leonard,Oh for God’s sake Sheldon.
2690,Sheldon,I would prefer that you not but I won’t go so far as to forbid it.
2691,Raj,Damn there’s always a catch.
2692,Raj,Sheldon get over here and help.
2693,Raj,Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!
2694,Leonard,Yeah I got it Sheldon why?
2695,Leonard,Like luminous fish.
2697,Penny,Although a rule about him texting me from in there might help with the romance.
2698,Leonard,Well this is silly so you don’t need the car but you could use it to buy yourself something else like a new purse to put all this money in.
2699,Sheldon,Prescription or non-prescription strength.
2700,Penny,What’s that about?
2701,Leonard,Okay let me just get right to it. Amy is judgmental sanctimonious and frankly just obnoxious.
2702,Howard,It’s not what I have it’s how many people I’m having it with.
2703,Raj,There are six seasons dude.
2704,Sheldon,Thank you for letting me come speak with you.
2705,Sheldon,But I’m not done. I have many additional concerns about these questions.
2706,Howard,I bought the first one it didn’t fall.
2707,Sheldon,Yeah.
2708,Raj,My god you think that every thought that comes out of your head is pure gold. Well let me tell you something. Some of those thoughts are pure caca.
2709,Leonard,What are you working on?
2710,Leonard, Nope.
2711,Penny,Raj I got you this before we split up but couldn’t return it and thought you’d like to have it. Happy belated Valentine’s Day Emily.
2712,Howard,Get it? Because you clogged up her bathroom like a radioactive monster!
2713,Sheldon,Although now I’m kind of worried someone’s hiding behind those drapes.
2714,Penny,I only figured that out because I’ve never heard of any of them.
2715,Howard,He doesn’t just look like C-3PO now he walks like him.
2716,Leonard,Yeah.
2717,Penny,Sure.
2718,Leonard,True dat.
2719,Leonard,I’m sorry Sheldon.
2720,Sheldon,Uh breakfast yes lunch no. I did have a cough drop but that really rides the line between sucking and eating.
2721,Penny,Why?
2722,Sheldon,Hello.
2723,Leonard,Hey I didn’t say it.
2724,Leonard,Huh? Would it work if I just punched you in the face?
2725,Howard,What do you think Sheldon? Want an action figure that looks just like you?
2726,Sheldon,If that concludes your faltering attempt to mate hello.
2727,Raj,No spoilers. No spoilers.
2728,Penny,Aw Stuart. Now I feel bad for murdering you.
2729,Raj,Are you kidding me? This may be the biggest scientific breakthrough of our lifetime. How can you as a theoretical physicist not care about this?
2730,Sheldon,My family history factoring in longevity propensity for disease et cetera.
2731,Leonard,Can we get autographed dolls?
2732,Sheldon,Are you listening to this? They deceive each other about everything.
2733,Leonard,And I support you.
2734,Sheldon,We’re not supposed to talk during this part.
2735,Leonard,Well that does sound much simpler. How long is this going to take?
2736,Sheldon,Well they do.
2737,Leonard,So anyway Howard asked Penny to talk to Bernadette and she did and Bernadette agreed to meet him for a cup of coffee.
2738,Penny,Oh man did the Kiss Army repeal don’t ask don’t tell?
2739,Sheldon,No. No I only told Leonard Howard Raj Kripke uh Professor Wu Professor Klein and a lunch lady in the cafeteria. How everyone else found out is a mystery to me.
2740,Leonard,Uh I don’t any day now.
2741,Sheldon,So you see it too.
2742,Penny,No he’s not. We’re just friends. Look is this gonna be a problem? Because he’s supposed to come over tomorrow to work.
2743,Raj,Actually I’ve never had three dates with the same woman.
2744,Leonard,Are you done?
2745,Sheldon,Fed.
2746,Howard,This is so messed up.
2747,Sheldon,It’s colloquial a conversation opener. So do you find the weather satisfying? Are you currently sharing in the triumph of some local sports team?
2748,Raj,So what’s up?
2749,Howard,Very good Bernadette. You are a regular Byomkesh Bakshi.
2750,Sheldon,You are in a forest. There is quicksand to the west a path leads to the east. Go east. An iron gate blocks your way. Open gate. It’s locked. Hmm well so much for that.
2751,Sheldon,I believe I would like to alter the paradigm of our relationship.
2752,Sheldon,Alicia?
2753,Penny,Oh thanks Mom.
2755,Penny,So you really gonna break up with her?
2756,Penny,Did she leave pit stains in your favourite crop top too?
2757,Sheldon,I.e I couldn’t become Green Lantern unless I was chosen by the guardians of Oa but given enough start-up capital and an adequate research facility I could be Batman.
2758,Leonard,You know they really have tried to like a lot of the same stuff we’re into.
2759,Howard,No I’m gonna brush Cinnamon’s teeth.
2760,Leonard,Hey hey hey you can’t leave. We just started.
2761,Sheldon,Then I hereby invoke what I’m given to understand is an integral part of the implied covenant of friendship. The favour.
2762,Sheldon,You’re acting odd. Why?
2763,Leonard,Oh. You had a party for your 60th?
2764,Penny,Okay.
2765,Raj,Dude my accent is brilliant.  Hey my snow-white American friends let’s put some cow meat on the barbecue and eat it until we’re all obese.
2766,Leonard,We like games.
2767,Leonard, What do you think?
2768,Sheldon,Amy the relationship agreement was not designed for either one of us to get our way.
2769,Penny,For God’s sake! 
2770,Howard,So your father-in-law is in there right now?
2771,Leonard,There’s beer in the fridge. Anyway you guys really don’t need to make a big deal.
2772,Sheldon,This is the level you’re stooping to.
2773,Penny,Yeah I’m sure he’ll be okay.
2774,Sheldon,So when can we get rid of it?
2775,Sheldon,That was awkward right?
2776,Penny,Curtis and I’m pretty sure he was joking.
2777,Howard,Hey Stuart is the Wil Wheaton signed up for the mystic warlords tournament THE Wil Wheaton from Star Trek?
2778,Sheldon,You know Germans have an interesting pre-wedding custom.
2779,Sheldon,Well I’d befriend SpongeBob but he’s not real so I can’t do that can I?
2780,Sheldon,So what exactly do you want us to do?
2781,Leonard,That would have hurt her feelings.
2782,Sheldon,Because he is neither tall nor immortal and none of us could be The Flash.
2783,Leonard,No.
2784,Penny,Okay. And Sheldon really believes we’re at a public swimming pool?
2785,Sheldon,I did a comprehensive background check. Medical records credit reports criminal history.  I trust you paid off those parking tickets.
2786,Raj,I like your bangs.
2788,Sheldon,So you can experiment on all the apes you want. But I want to manipulate the emotions of two captive human beings suddenly I’m the monster.
2789,Sheldon,Mmm.
2790,Leonard,Sure what’s up?
2791,Raj,She’s kidding right?
2792,Sheldon,And of course the answer is giant magneto resistance.
2793,Leonard,No.
2794,Sheldon,I am glad you asked. Are you familiar with the Higgs boson?
2795,Sheldon,Good lord!
2796,Penny,You do?
2797,Leonard,You know what this part isn’t that technical. You actually could.
2798,Penny,Listening to Dr. Cooper has made me want to start cutting myself again
2799,Howard,Is it Eddie Crispo?
2800,Sheldon,Eight.
2801,Howard,Don’t blow too hard. If you pop him I will vomit.
2802,Penny,Far be it from me to criticize a man with a full pubis. Look Sheldon your problem is not Wil Wheaton okay? Your problem is the way you treated Amy.
2803,Leonard,Right. No surprises.
2804,Penny,Is that really what’s important right now?
2805,Penny,Relax we got time this is so fun.
2806,Leonard,Yeah well she’s not gonna be your wife for long.
2807,Sheldon,Just because I am easily bothered by light heat sound smell and the way birds look at me does not mean I’m sensitive.
2808,Sheldon,At a neurobiology conference? What a mean thing to say.
2809,Sheldon,Drink a healing potion.
2810,Sheldon,You mean like Salt Lake City?
2811,Sheldon,Well I believe I’m treating you generously. That’s why I’ve stipulated in the contract that your contributions to our invention are as valuable as my own.
2812,Leonard,Just to clarify which one of you is wearing the bikini?
2813,Sheldon,Think of me as Arthur Dent in Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy lying in front of the bulldozers to protect his home.
2814,Sheldon,I just don’t see why I need a driver’s license Albert Einstein never had a driver’s license.
2815,Sheldon,Were you trying to impress Penny?
2816,Sheldon,You know you’re right. Yeah. You know it’s like when Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created Spider-Man. Stan Lee may get all the credit but Steve Ditko knows he was just as important. Even though Stan Lee gets to be in all the Marvel movies. And. and he’s far richer. And he’s a household name you know? Whereas you know you say Ditko and that sounds like a company that makes Dits.
2817,Sheldon,Now how do you propose I get home?
2818,Penny,What did I do?
2819,Leonard,Uh where what is?
2820,Penny,Okay well forget it. I’m not spending my New Year’s Eve at a comic book store wearing a Wonder Woman costume.
2821,Raj,And we’re blending and we’re blending and we’re done.
2822,Sheldon,It’s too late for Koothrappali. Let’s go.
2823,Penny,I’m sorry. Is this supposed to be buttering me up?
2824,Raj,I say double feature.
2825,Howard,Hey. Yeah. Hey sorry if last night was awkward.
2826,Raj,Well I’ve been quite enjoying that. It combines all the superhero fun of Spider-Man with all the body-switching shenanigans of Freaky Friday. Both versions original and Lohan.
2827,Raj,No it’s not. She was too beautiful for me.
2828,Howard,Oh great. No Superman no Wonder Woman? All we’ve got is a skinny Flash an Indian Aquaman a nearsighted Green Lantern and a teeny tiny Dark Knight.
2829,Penny,Well it wasn’t the first suggestion that came to mind but it’s the one I’m going with.
2830,Howard,Really? I can come? Thanks.
2831,Sheldon,Can you believe this guy?
2832,Leonard,He always needs all the attention. He’s such a baby.
2833,Sheldon,And taking her first step towards a lifetime of laughter love and best of all rules.
2834,Raj,That’s a great idea I’m going to get him to sign a Batman as well.
2835,Penny,I’m sorry I don’t get the point.
2836,Sheldon,There.
2837,Penny,You wanted to meet my friends.
2838,Sheldon,Well I have and it will knock your socks off! Good luck getting them back on.
2839,Sheldon,Thank you. My friend Leonard said if I bothered you while you were eating you’d think I was a creepy stalker.
2840,Sheldon,Well admittedly this brushes up against my well-known aversions to heat small places going below floor-level dampness hatches ladders darkness echoes and eliminating in Home Depot buckets. That last one is quite new but I have a feeling that’s gonna rocket to the top of the list.
2841,Sheldon,Please please please let me meet Hawking.
2842,Leonard,Got it. Bye.
2843,Sheldon,Until I find a permanent place I will stay with friends.
2844,Leonard,He can’t help it. He can’t. He really can’t.
2845,Sheldon,Leonard get ready for an apology. And with the added twist of an M. Night Shyamalan movie I’m going to mean it.
2846,Sheldon,Hello.
2847,Leonard,We only have two months to deliver this to the Air Force because of you.
2848,Sheldon,You know however with the Xbox One I can control my entire entertainment system using voice commands. Up until now I’ve had to use Leonard.
2849,Sheldon,Yeah okay you can stop trying to make this about our relationship.
2850,Raj,Oh thanks man.
2851,Leonard,God this is going to be bad.
2852,Leonard,All right fair enough. I certainly can be quieter when we kiss. I thought it was an expression of passion but if it’s coming across as juicy and weird who wants that? Uh uh I’m sorry can you be more specific on how my eyebrows are stupid? Nah never mind it’s right here.
2853,Raj,What happens in costume at Comic-con stays at Comic-con.
2854,Sheldon,They’re not my friends.
2855,Penny,Yes I left them in the washers and when I went down to get them they were gone.
2856,Penny,That is not true.
2857,Sheldon,Did you make the apology as sincere as I would have?
2858,Raj,Can we bring anything?
2859,Leonard,It doesn’t.
2860,Raj,Thirty seconds.
2861,Leonard,Oh just come in!
2862,Penny,I dunno. I just think it’s a waste.  Relax. I’m just looking at the box.
2863,Leonard,You know you don’t need to use Sheldon to get your way with me in a dumb roommate agreement.
2864,Leonard,Okeydoke.
2865,Leonard,You could have stopped at “it could go well.”
2866,Raj,You call yourself a friend? I was trying to help you and at the first sign of trouble you ran away leaving me to fend off a family of rats. You’re a completely selfish human being and a and a physical and a moral coward.
2867,Leonard,I don’t know Morse code.
2868,Howard,Look I know you guys are upset but we’ve talked about it and we think it’d be beneficial for you to be part of the project.
2869,Leonard,Laser demonstration’s looking pretty good now huh?
2870,Sheldon,It’s a made-up story Leonard I don’t even know why you’re talking about it.
2871,Sheldon,Well there is our quantum cognition experiment. You and I could spend more time on that.
2872,Penny,I’m not going out with him. He can sleep with whoever he wants.
2873,Sheldon,Nevertheless I didn’t say it. Anyway I would like you to come back and work for me.
2874,Leonard,So Stuart have you thought about what you’d do if Howard sells the house?
2875,Raj,First day of cricket camp. They drew it so the testicles were my eyes.
2876,Sheldon,Yeah and if he does ask you go. It’s amazing.
2877,Penny,Okay well maybe not that slow.
2878,Howard,While showering topless 16 minutes after brief side butt during a pillow fight with her sorority sisters.
2879,Penny,That was a cute story. So um what did you want to ask me?
2880,Leonard,Right. Sorry sorry.
2881,Howard,What? You’ve kissed like once in three years.
2882,Leonard,Looks like Wolowitz got the net electrified.
2883,Howard,Well it’s too late.
2884,Sheldon,H-O gauge trains are 1/87th scale. N gauge are 1/160th scale. And that brings us to Z gauge at a you could easily swallow it don’t ask how I know 1 to 220.
2885,Penny,Hi. Welcome back. How was Texas?
2886,Penny,Sheldon it was just a little tremor.
2887,Leonard,Shh-shh-shh!
2888,Raj,Yeah.
2889,Sheldon,I don’t understand what’s wrong with socks.
2890,Howard,I don’t know. This old pen kind of proves gravity. When I tilt it her bathing suit falls right off.
2891,Sheldon,All right. Leonard is attempting to learn why sub-atomic particles move the way they do.
2892,Penny,No! I don’t want to try it my God you are grown men how could you waste your lives with these stupid toys and costumes and comic books and… and now that… that…
2893,Sheldon,Amen to that.
2894,Leonard,Okay let’s keep it moving.
2895,Sheldon,He says he’s not coming to the roommate agreement meeting tomorrow.
2896,Sheldon,Yeah oh I’m sorry. I should’ve mentioned this earlier. You’re not invited.
2897,Howard,Thank you Sheldon. It’s a blank notebook.
2898,Leonard,Yeah okay I’m good.
2899,Leonard,Yeah. Uh maybe we were hacked. You know the Chinese have been hacking everything lately.
2900,Raj,Really?
2901,Penny,Ugh. Why are you washing Howard’s man panties?
2902,Leonard,What’s wrong?
2903,Sheldon,Excuse me. Are you saying that Wil Wheaton aka Ensign Wesley Crusher on Star Trek
2904,Penny,Third floor tonight. Mixing it up?  Oh. You know I still don’t understand why you just don’t go to dinner or something.
2905,Penny,Oh damn it you are.
2906,Sheldon,Interesting. If my official residence were across the hall I wonder if I’d need to knock every time I came over here.
2907,Howard,I know I am resplendent like the noonday sun am I not?
2908,Sheldon,April 13 a dark night indeed.
2909,Sheldon,Well first I think the fact that you use your birthday as a password is embarrassing.
2910,Penny,It might. Boy you’re really smart.
2911,Leonard,Come on guys. Raj put a lot of effort into this. And that’s great. It’s not sad it’s great.
2912,Howard,Just that I’m definitely not gay.
2913,Penny,What’s that?
2914,Penny,Well yeah.
2915,Penny,Sorry.
2916,Howard,I’m on it.
2917,Raj,Oh Daddy you’re so rich and funny.
2918,Sheldon,Uh hello again. Um yeah I don’t know if women in general have been actively discouraged from pursuing the sciences but it’s clear you young women here today have been. While I was listening to my colleagues waste your time it occurred to me that it might be much more meaningful to hear about women in science from actual women in science and uh I happen to know two brilliant examples who have agreed to speak to you on the phone right now. Uh Dr. Rostenkowski Dr. Fowler are you there?
2919,Sheldon,And now you’re gone too. It’s like all the men I’ve looked up to have gone away.
2920,Penny,It’s fusion.
2921,Howard,Come on Sheldon say something.
2922,Sheldon,It is hideous.
2923,Sheldon,Well if Amy’s too busy that gives the rest of you an opportunity to make my life easier thus assuring yourselves a footnote in my memoirs tentatively entitled You’re Welcome Mankind. All right then just shout when you hear the task you want to undertake. Uh dentist. Okay we can circle back to that one. Um well who wants to take me Wednesday morning to get new heels put on my dress shoes? Anyone? Oh. That one had hoot written all over it. Um all right uh dermatologist? Allergist? Podiatrist? Supercuts? Okay okay here’s a fun one. Um I need a new picture frame and I have a hankering for Swedish meatballs. Who wants to spend the day with me at IKEA?
2924,Howard,What did you do?
2925,Sheldon,Not to tell anyone.
2926,Leonard,No no it doesn’t matter we’ll be at work.
2927,Leonard,Hey I got new boots this year. Guaranteed to add three inches.
2928,Penny,Ugh I should’ve never bought him that colouring book that explains Black History Month.
2929,Penny,What do you want?
2930,Sheldon,Yes?
2931,Leonard,Really? Amy?
2932,Penny,Hey have you ever heard of the Van Nuys Comic-Con?
2933,Sheldon,I am not guilty. I only have a learner’s permit Penny was the teacher. When the light turned yellow she said go go go so I went went went.
2934,Penny,Oh this isn’t alcohol. It’s a magic potion that makes me like you.
2935,Sheldon,Thank you. Amy I’d like to apologize. Your accomplishment was impressive. And I’m proud of you.
2936,Sheldon,Yes.
2937,Leonard,Hey Ramona. Come on in.
2938,Raj,So uh who’s in?
2939,Penny,See she’s trying to get you back. Now that is exactly what I would’ve gotten you if I had any idea what it is or what you do.
2940,Raj,Oh well nice to meet you.
2941,Leonard,Well is that all of it?  Just set it down.
2942,Sheldon,That’s the great thing. It doesn’t matter. My mind is freed up to think about more important things.
2943,Howard,Pretty good. She bought the book Eat Pray Love and used it to set my father’s Mercedes on fire. So what’s up with you guys?
2945,Raj,Like what?
2946,Penny,So you got canned huh?
2947,Leonard,Kind of busy here Sheldon.
2948,Sheldon,What happened to them?
2949,Howard,It’s completely inappropriate for a single woman to entertain a man in private. If you insist on talking you must do it on the couch! All right you may talk in the bedroom but I want this door to remain open! All right just this once you may close the door. But keep in mind I’ll be right out here monitoring the situation!  Priya this is your brother. When you get this tell Leonard to check his voicemail.
2950,Raj,Hey here comes Stuart and his date.
2951,Sheldon,Turkey and roast beef with swiss and lettuce on wholewheat. It’s the right ingredients but in the wrong order. In a proper sandwich the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce. They might as well have dragged this thing through a car wash.
2952,Sheldon,Indeed. Penny a salon is a gathering where intellectuals entertained each other with sparkling conversations about issues of the day.
2953,Leonard,Then we’ll go to a hotel.
2954,Raj,Name one.
2955,Leonard,No it’s not.
2956,Sheldon,Oh no! I can’t!
2957,Sheldon,I don’t need a vacation.
2958,Sheldon,People compete for jobs and trophies why not me?
2959,Sheldon,I’m open to the possibility.
2960,Leonard,I can’t just go up and talk to her. Howard you talk to her.
2961,Penny,Mm. Well the biggie is if she has an insane roommate kick him out as soon as possible.
2962,Raj,I should’ve peed before we left.
2963,Raj,Totally guys are the worst. I mean look at me. I let Emily make me a frittata and I kept the leftovers in Claire’s fridge that night. I’m such a dog.
2964,Penny,Hey you’re up early.
2965,Raj,Maybe I could use it to understand why women keep dumping me.
2966,Sheldon,Seven little marshmallows no more no less?
2967,Raj,God I love the smell of paintballs in the morning.
2968,Penny,No. I need to start making some smart decisions.
2969,Leonard,Sheldon!
2970,Penny,Haven’t seen you in a while. How’s it going?
2971,Leonard,No don’t do that.
2972,Sheldon,Well I needed something bigger than peas now didn’t I?
2973,Raj,Thank you darling.
2974,Sheldon,I’m very congested.
2975,Penny,You guys been here long?
2976,Howard,Hey guys guess who I found at LAX. My baby sister Priya.
2977,Sheldon,Oh come now. Your undergraduate work must have included a varmints and critters class.
2978,Raj,Wait how can how can anyone ruin Raiders? It’s perfect.
2979,Penny,Oh.
2980,Howard,Leonard I I’m scared again.
2981,Howard,I’ve been plenty of times. If I miss one it’s fine. I’m a big boy.
2982,Penny,Let’s just talk about our periods.
2983,Leonard,I brought snacks.
2984,Sheldon,And welcome to the first on location episode of Dr. Sheldon Cooper and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present…
2985,Leonard,Huh. Is that a good idea? I mean you think they’ll consider someone who was in prison for selling drugs?
2986,Raj,Well I thought… Come on I didn’t want anyone to feel bad at the end of the game. And some of those puzzles were really hard and I didn’t know who was gonna get Penny.
2987,Sheldon,Or Don Quixote is a book about a donkey named Hotay.
2988,Howard,Hey.
2989,Leonard,Are you insane you can’t just break into a woman’s apartment in the middle of the night and clean.
2990,Leonard,Fines?
2991,Sheldon,It’s a very nice community. The Queen Mary is docked there once the largest ocean liner in the world it’s now a hotel and restaurant where they host a surprisingly gripping murder mystery dinner.
2992,Howard,You have to get to it eventually.
2993,Sheldon, Leonard and Penny.
2995,Leonard,Well i-i-i-it’s just if a person doesn’t have a sense of achievement in their real life it’s easy to lose themselves in a virtual world where they get a false sense of accomplishment.
2996,Sheldon,I’m attempting to turn over a new leaf. Earlier today it was pointed out to me that I tend to force my ideas on people.
2997,Sheldon,All righty! An 8.2 magnitude earthquake devastates Pasadena reducing mighty edifices to dust engulfing the city in flames. The streets flow with blood and echo with the cries of the wounded. Oh excellent choice. Now put on your hard hat and safety vest.
2998,Sheldon,Thank you. And slam it hard because I am pretty steamed.
2999,Penny,Are you gonna let him talk to me like this?
3000,Raj,I’m all for it.
3001,Leonard,No no I’m confident. It’s not like I’m unfamiliar with the get lost conversation. Although this will be the first time I’ll be the one saying it.
3002,Penny,I can’t believe you were testing me against a chimp.
3003,Sheldon,Yes. May I ask you a question before I give it to you?
3004,Howard,I do have a pretty balls-to-the-wall moisturising regimen.
3005,Sheldon,What can be more special than having an adequate amount of time to cross the street on your way to buy a tiny LEGO Indiana Jones?
3006,Raj,It’s not a big deal. It just took like five minutes to set up.
3007,Leonard,I’m talking about important things like emotional maturity.
3008,Sheldon,No they’re private.
3009,Leonard,Hello can you hear me? Sheldon I haven’t changed the filter in the water pitcher in two years.
3010,Leonard,You do realize everyone’s eating at Raj’s again tonight?
3011,Sheldon,Who do I speak to about permanently reserving this table?
3012,Raj,Maybe it means something different in this country. Back in India it means you’re upset with a guy named Howard!
3013,Sheldon,Really? You think I care if a man what shared a pumpkin latte with a dynamite lady?
3014,Sheldon,I suppose it could end up on a collision course with Earth and destroy life as we know it.
3015,Leonard,C’mon Raj how am I supposed to know who she’s attracted to. Or was attracted to. Or who she might be attracted to. In the future.
3016,Penny,Hi.
3017,Howard,It turns out he doesn’t care if I’m married or if I’m single. He’s basically given up on me.
3018,Howard,You know I recently read a fascinating article on infidelity among penguins.
3019,Sheldon,Well according to my research the steam tunnels below this access point should be the closest analog to the mines.
3020,Penny,It is freaking amazing.
3021,Penny,That’s gross.
3022,Raj,But Bernadette makes more money than Howard. She basically supports him.
3023,Penny,Ew 50? We’ll be old and gross.
3024,Raj,I thought about what you said last night and I went back on the dating Web site and I was looking at this girl’s profile. She’s amazing.
3025,Howard,I’d like to propose a toast to friends no matter how quirky.
3026,Leonard,Really? How could you tell?
3027,Sheldon,We were discussing Raj’s recent breakup and apparently I was insensitive to him.
3028,Howard,Oh uh these are my my friends. This is Bernadette.
3029,Leonard,Is that even possible?
3030,Leonard,Is it my turn to talk about the compromises I make?
3031,Howard,You’re being silly. I can leave whenever I want.
3032,Penny,Complimentary nachos! You enjoy. Never had sex? Wow.
3033,Leonard,Penny we are made of particles that have existed since the moment the universe began. I like to think those atoms travelled 14 billion years through time and space to create us so that we could be together and make each other whole.
3034,Sheldon,Well I do now. They’re a lovely people. Although terrifying when you wake up face-to-face with them. If you’re hungry I brought home some mutton and coconut milk.
3035,Sheldon,Yes baseball.
3036,Howard,Hey look the new Warlords of Ka’a expansion pack is out.
3037,Leonard,Amy.
3038,Raj,Don’t listen to him. He says crazy things all the time. Uh watch. Marco.
3039,Penny,Oh no I can’t give up my acting classes. I’m a professional actress.
3040,Raj,I’m not finishing your sentence. You pulled the plug on my funk.
3041,Raj,Mine just took me to his gynecology office. I got so bored I’d put vaginal lubricant on the bottom of my shoes and pretend I was ice-skating.
3042,Raj,You coming?
3043,Howard,Thank you Mummy I love you. Helicopters for everybody.
3044,Sheldon,Why would I flip out? Is it a spider? It’s a spider.
3045,Leonard,Okay I’ll walk down with you. So last night was fun huh?
3046,Penny,Oh not good. Still couldn’t get in to see Dr. Gallo.
3047,Sheldon,Gosh Penny what’d you have for breakfast? A big glass of good question juice? The Nebraska state flag is simply the state seal on a field of blue. Spread your legs invite them in.
3048,Leonard,I feel terrible.
3049,Leonard,You put moths in my food?
3050,Penny,No I don’t want there to be secrets between us.
3051,Howard,Are there any chopsticks?
3052,Howard,Nice close up by the way.
3053,Howard,Yeah you’ll love it. Ain’t no party like a Koothra-party.
3054,Sheldon,Do we have to? I really don’t want to hear the religious lecture.
3055,Leonard,Sheldon I’m not alone in here.
3056,Sheldon,In the jungle the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight…
3057,Leonard,Well now…
3058,Sheldon,Wait! Leonard! Wait! What am I going to do for dinner?
3059,Howard,Let’s see. Uh his name is Trent Monaco.
3060,Leonard,It was nice you know. A lot of people showed up told some great stories about him. Did you know that Arthur’s son is a high school sci…?  Hey the guys are about to start Jedi. You want to go watch?
3061,Penny,Okay. Oh and just a heads-up mm since the last time you saw me naked I got a Cookie Monster tattoo. The acceptable responses when you see it are awesome or nothing.
3062,Leonard,I don’t know what am I doing?
3065,Leonard,Here’s an idea. I’m just throwing it out there friends who have sex.
3066,Leonard,And your poll numbers just keep dropping.
3067,Leonard,I bet I could throw a rock in this room and come up with three better friends.
3068,Penny,Constance are you sure I can’t pour you some wine?
3069,Sheldon,If we could figure out the scientific basis for Marty’s hover board that would have universal application.
3070,Sheldon,Now you see what you’ve done? Because of you we’re all going to miss Stan Lee.
3071,Leonard,You can’t let her get into your head.
3072,Penny,Yes. He taught he taw a Romulan.
3073,Sheldon,Point taken. It has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn’t want to rip our eyes out.
3074,Leonard,Good. This is exciting.
3075,Sheldon,Yeah well I know that now.
3076,Raj,Of ghosts no. Of you little bit.
3077,Raj,Hey don’t discourage him. This is a fantastic opportunity.
3078,Raj,Oh you’re so arrogant. If you were a superhero your name would be Captain Arrogant. And you know what your superpower would be? Arrogance.
3079,Leonard,Bye Missy see you.
3080,Raj,You’re one to talk. You’ve been complaining about Stuart living here for the past year. I don’t see you showing him the door.
3081,Sheldon,As I’ve stated before on numerous occasions the only sea creature I would even consider being eaten by is the Kraken because the last words I would hear are “Release the Kraken.” That never gets old. “Release the Kraken!” Oh chills. Besides I’m having dinner with Amy.
3082,Howard,Sheldon what did Amy have that attracted you?
3083,Leonard,Oh good an English accent the sexiest accent you can have.
3084,Penny,I’m coming. Goodbye Sheldon. What do you mean transgressions I’ve committed?
3085,Sheldon,These are my own bowling shoes.
3086,Sheldon,That’s it? I thought there’d be more of a reason why you’re here.
3087,Raj,Penny you became disenchanted with Leonard as a lover. Would you please tell my sister why?
3088,Leonard,Not as much as you.
3089,Leonard,Yeah. Wow An appearance by George Lucas… ‘s dermatologist. Oh I want that autograph.
3090,Penny,Again I’m sorry.
3091,Penny,Okay.
3092,Howard,Oh yeah I got that Evite. Ever since I saw Pretty in Pink I’ve wanted to go to an American prom. But then I saw Carrie and I did not want to go to an American prom. But then I saw Never Been Kissed and I’m back on the prom bandwagon. This prom thing’s been a real roller coaster.
3093,Sheldon,Yes.
3094,Howard,Sheldon what if he gets his Internet from his cable company? He could lose his HBO and all their delightful original programming.
3096,Penny,Okay.
3097,Sheldon,You’re right. Nice going.
3098,Leonard,Oh well you know you did throw an 8 gig iPod… yeah no how could he do that.
3099,Sheldon,I’m mapping basic topics of conversation and with whom they can be discussed. I call these circles zones of privacy. Don’t Google that unless you want to see pictures of people’s genitals. This circle contains only me and you. It represents subjects we only share with each other details of physical intimacy bathroom habits. Although as I’m saying it I may need to add Dr. Fink in here.
3100,Penny,I told you about him.
3101,Howard,Sure. Tell us again how you screwed up and got Penny back together with her old boyfriend.
3102,Leonard,I don’t have any.
3103,Penny,You know can I ask you a question?
3104,Raj,Maybe you should keep your eye on the ball Papa.
3105,Penny,Yeah. Okay I got it. I got it. So what is all that stuff?
3106,Leonard,Actually it’s centripetal force which is an inward force generated by the glass acting on the olive. 
3107,Leonard,Let’s have a toast. To Mrs. Wolowitz. A loving mother to all of us. We’ll miss you.
3108,Raj,These spring rolls are amazing. Good job Bernadette.
3109,Sheldon,Good evening. I’m your guest lecturer Dr. Sheldon Cooper. I was expecting applause but I suppose stunned silence is equally appropriate. I agreed to speak to you this evening because I was told that you’re the best and the brightest of this university’s doctoral candidates. Hmm. Of course that’s like saying you are the most important electron in a hydrogen atom. ‘Cause you see there’s only one electron in a hydrogen atom. Best and brightest my sweet patootie. All right let’s begin. Show of hands who here is familiar with the concept of topological insulators? Don’t kid yourselves.
3111,Leonard,Wow.
3112,Penny,Aw.
3114,Penny,Look Sheldon I just don’t think that the guys and Leonard really meant to hurt you. You know? They just told an unfortunate lie to deal with a difficult situation. Okay you know what it’s like? Remember that scene in the new Star Trek movie when Kirk has to take over the ship so he tells Spock all that stuff he knew wasn’t true like saying Spock didn’t care his mom died?
3115,Raj,Ah it’s good enough for Facebook.
3116,Penny,Next Monday.
3117,Howard,How hot is it?
3118,Penny,So I just want you to relax and kind of move around in the space. You know just do whatever feels natural. Sheldon?
3119,Penny,Uh yeah I think we’ll pass.
3120,Sheldon,Oh there’s my missing neutrino. You were hiding from me as an unbalanced charge weren’t you you little subatomic Dickens?
3121,Leonard,Okay fine. Do you want to know why I dressed like The Hulk? Because I was always mad at my mom and I wanted to smash my way out of that house.
3122,Sheldon,We’re not afraid of physical activity.
3123,Sheldon,I know. Sometimes I would just like to be appreciated for my mind.
3124,Penny,Yes.
3125,Raj,And it was Gandhi who said live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.
3127,Sheldon,Satellites are down. Solar flares.
3128,Sheldon,Really? Why?
3129,Sheldon,So I win.
3130,Sheldon,Who is it? Oh hello Penny it’s open come in. Sarcasm.
3131,Sheldon,It’s not enough that you made me watch that movie but now you mock me with it?
3132,Sheldon,Now would you say ointment is more equal to or less funny than kumquat?
3133,Sheldon,We accept your challenge. Name a time and place.
3134,Sheldon,With certain obvious exceptions. Suicide for example.
3135,Penny,You know your friend Stuart?
3136,Raj,Have you tried anything to fix it?
3137,Raj,I both hate you and want to be you. This is Ryan Gosling all over again.
3139,Sheldon,Crazy bastard?
3140,Penny,Oh Sheldon you don’t even like it there.
3141,Leonard,Do it.
3142,Leonard,Even during? ‘Cause sometimes I have questions.
3143,Leonard,I’m just trying to protect you. How many times did I see you get your heart broken trying to make it as an actress?
3144,Penny,All right. Let’s give it a shot.
3145,Penny,I know.
3146,Leonard,Hmm atom of hydrogen Adam of Maroon 5 mic drop.
3147,Penny,My singing?
3148,Sheldon,It scared me straight Leonard.
3149,Raj,All I know Mummy is that he’s a single wealthy doctor and now for some reason there’s no money for your little boy.
3150,Penny,Uh you know I’m not really around that much. Amy knows much more than I do.
3151,Leonard,Not only is he still not talking to me but there’s this thing he does where he stares at you and tries to get your brain to explode. You know like in the classic sci-fi movie Scanners?  You know bzzz-pchew! Never mind. How about this one. It says “I know my physics but I’m still a fun guy!”
3152,Leonard,Uh not so good. We have to talk.
3153,Raj,Okay. I have a request to make.
3154,Sheldon,Well anything can sound silly when you put it in that tone.
3156,Leonard,Sure. Hey want to hear a fun fact about mustard?
3157,Sheldon,Instead of a titanium centrifuge my parents bought me… wow this is hard. They got me… a motorised dirt bike.
3159,Leonard,Not to blow on a miniature time machine.
3160,Sheldon,I’m sorry if you didn’t cheer at my entrance it’s too late to buy into the premise. Anyway I got some extra money from the head of the department and raj can come work for me.
3161,Leonard,If that’s what you want to do yes.
3162,Sheldon,Go ahead.
3163,Leonard,Penny just because people appreciate comic books doesn’t make them weirdos. Stuart’s a terrific artist. He went to the Rhode Island School of Design.
3164,Sheldon,Huh. It can’t be a coincidence. There must be some causal link I’m missing.
3165,Howard,Space ice is no joke. I can’t even watch Frozen anymore.
3166,Leonard,Upon review I’ve changed my mind about the Cooper-Hofstadter hypothesis that space-time is like a superfluid. In fact it’s inspired me to come up with my own theory. Maybe space-time is like two clowns with their heads in a bucket much like Cooper and Hofstadter.
3167,Leonard,I don’t know what to say.
3168,Leonard,Yeah! Funny how things work out.
3169,Penny,No I think she was just trying to help. Plus I really want to do well at this job. So…
3170,Sheldon,Oh yes. It runs on the world’s most powerful graphics chip imagination.
3171,Sheldon,Why do you ask?
3172,Howard,Are you serious?
3173,Sheldon,These shrimp are all the same size. There’s no the logical order to eat them in.
3174,Sheldon,Yes this is remarkable.
3176,Leonard,Sheldon just sent me a picture of him and Bill Nye getting smoothies.
3177,Sheldon,Fine.
3178,Leonard,Okay. Thanks. Hey. I think you may have dropped this?
3179,Leonard,I don’t understand why we’re leaving so early for the movie.
3180,Raj,Oh oh yeah and then there was the time when Leonard and I took Howard to Las Vegas and paid a hooker to pretend she was Jewish and that she wanted his little kosher pickle. Of all the Howard humping hookers stories that one’s my favourite!
3181,Penny,37.
3182,Leonard,Not as pathetic as dressing up like this and going to a comic book store on New Year’s Eve.
3183,Leonard,Yeah? That’s because you’re beautiful and your beauty fills my heart with love and song.
3185,Leonard,Sheldon we have to call it off.
3186,Leonard,She might disappear but she’s definitely not cleaning anything.
3187,Penny,What’s up?
3188,Penny,Hang on. Wait you actually think it’s 2003?
3189,Leonard,Oh. I hate to say it but it sounds like he’s interested in her.
3190,Penny,E-e-e-e-eh! Wrong answer but thank you for playing.
3191,Raj,Why would I want her number? I don’t want anything to do with this woman.
3192,Howard,Really? Cool.
3193,Leonard,Lay it on me.
3194,Leonard,I’m going to bed.
3195,Leonard,Borrowed?
3196,Penny,Oh we know what’s causing that don’t we?
3197,Raj,Oh I call dibs on the Golden Age Flash.
3198,Sheldon,And I forbid it.
3199,Leonard,No listen we wrote a paper together. Now we get to go to a university and talk about it? That’s pretty cool.
3200,Leonard,Are you okay to drive?
3201,Howard,It it is. It’s not just comic books. They’ve got action figures toys a Tron-themed dance party.
3202,Sheldon,They are in 2003.
3203,Howard,Okay here’s the deal six months ago my research testing the predicted composition of trans-Neptunian objects ran into a dead end.
3204,Sheldon,You didn’t let me finish. Dinfast . Are those soy-based candles?
3205,Sheldon,It is great isn’t it? We have a wonderful evening ahead of us.
3206,Sheldon,It’s the comic book store.
3207,Sheldon,Which is stronger than ever. This is about you trying to change my environment which was perfect the way it was.
3208,Sheldon,Well it would be except that I left string theory because I decided it was a dead end. Yeah and then she went behind my back to help someone else prove me wrong. My rival no less. I’m sorry you had to see that.
3209,Leonard,Hey how’d it go with human resources?
3210,Leonard,Because of you I’m not allowed to adjust the temperature in my own home. I’m not allowed to whistle. I don’t wear shoes that might squeak.
3211,Sheldon,Ready?
3212,Howard,That’s not overconfidence that’s observation.
3214,Leonard,He’s right. You can’t. 
3215,Leonard,That’s right say my name and beg me for more ’cause I’m gonna give it to you.
3216,Leonard,I quit.
3217,Leonard,My birthday.
3218,Sheldon,It’s bad enough I’m being taken against my will. I don’t see why it has to be in some hippie’s mobile sex dungeon.
3219,Sheldon,Well alright then.
3220,Penny,Does the baby have a name yet?
3221,Raj,Don’t start with me dude.
3222,Sheldon,Now whether that propagation is in the interest of humanity is of course an entirely different question.
3223,Sheldon,No no no you’ve misstated the atomic weight of the target.
3224,Leonard,Why not?
3225,Leonard,Oh. Yeah. Okay sure. What’s going on with your brother?
3226,Sheldon,Why do I need you now?
3227,Leonard,It is. You just kind of put a damper on things when you said the next person I see talking with food in their mouth will be put to death.
3228,Sheldon,Why do you even want this here? Its size is completely disproportionate to its purpose.
3229,Sheldon,But I thought you wanted to cancel?
3230,Raj,Yeah I calmed her down but she’s not going to Vegas if he’s going.
3231,Leonard,Now you can come with us.
3232,Raj,Okay Sheldon. I’m going to be leading you through a series of meditation exercises. These methods come from the ancient gurus of India and have helped me overcome my own fears.
3233,Sheldon,Surprise.
3234,Leonard,Actually I think it’s more of wool fire ant blend.
3235,Raj,Well it’s easy to find out. Just go into the crawlspace under the house and check.
3236,Leonard,Oh. I love those.
3237,Howard,Answering the question once and for all why Wolowitz bailed out of medical school.
3238,Raj,I have that same underwear.
3239,Penny,Okay. Me me me. Ready?  Leonard I am your father.
3240,Penny,Oh it’s nice you got him that.
3241,Leonard,Hello. Yeah I’m Leonard Hofstadter. Yeah yeah he’s my roommate. Oh God is he okay? Yeah alright alright I’ll be right there.
3242,Howard,You’ve been a sucky friend a sucky sucky friend.
3243,Penny,Ooh!
3244,Howard,Yeah right. You’re just jealous because it turns out I’m Penny’s number two choice after Leonard.
3245,Raj,I’m sorry. This is very sweet. Thanks.
3246,Raj,That is so beautiful.
3247,Sheldon,They did.
3248,Leonard,Sorry.
3249,Leonard,I don’t know. Foreplay?
3250,Howard,Why not?
3251,Penny,Okay sit down. Listen Emily what happened between me and Raj was a long time ago.
3252,Sheldon, Amy.
3253,Howard,Yeah that’s not worrisome at all.
3254,Penny,Okay he wants to talk to you.
3255,Penny,It’s really good.
3256,Sheldon,Yeah I always thought if I were ever enslaved it would be by an advanced species from another planet not some hotsy-totsy from Glendale.
3257,Leonard,Killer robot. We built it.
3258,Raj,That’s my joke. I told it last night. You can’t just use it.
3259,Leonard,So you’ve been through this before?
3260,Leonard,Sheldon I think I’ve made a mistake.
3261,Penny,Sheldon I’m not waiting on you.
3262,Sheldon,What are you doing?
3263,Raj,Oh no she’s gonna leave you for someone might as well get it over with.
3264,Penny,Yeah. All right just come here. Look I get me working with Zack is weird and I don’t want you to be uncomfortable.
3265,Penny,Don’t you want to get dressed first?
3266,Sheldon,Yes.
3267,Raj,How about soup?
3268,Leonard,Yeah.
3269,Leonard,Fine. I’ll ask if she has a friend for you.
3270,Penny,Oh God wait slow hit the brakes hit the brakes!
3271,Penny,Really?
3272,Penny,What is happening?
3273,Sheldon,Do you prefer ointment or cream?
3274,Leonard,Penny? Hey it’s Penny. Everybody say hi to Penny.
3275,Howard,I do like that the ex-boyfriend’s out of the picture.
3276,Penny,Aw jewellery. Oh my God Lakers tickets?
3277,Penny,I have a video of me singing last night do you want to see it?
3278,Penny,Come on Leonard you are entitled to try and make things go the way you want them to.
3279,Howard,I’m busy.
3280,Sheldon,Why?
3281,Leonard,Uh if I still have them they’re probably in the junk box.
3282,Penny,I don’t know why but I always pictured her as Indian.
3283,Howard,I I said she but lot’s of things are she boats and cars whales like thar she blows!
3284,Leonard,I couldn’t say that I would have to say you were terrific and I can’t wait to hear you sing again.
3286,Raj,Oh well you said you didn’t have time to go out for dinner so I thought we could have one right here.
3287,Penny,Okay only if you’re sure. Whew.
3288,Raj,We do?
3289,Leonard,Okay he gets how cool it is.
3290,Howard,Right now Howard’s staring down at our planet like a tiny Jewish Greek god. Zeusowitz.
3291,Leonard,And that’s still good for you.
3292,Howard,I think it could be romantic. You know my parents met at his place of work.
3293,Howard,I don’t want to say.
3294,Raj,Whoa. Humongous man crush dude.
3295,Sheldon,Come on.
3296,Leonard,Sheldon I know what you did now change the password back.
3297,Leonard,Actually I couldn’t get too mad at him about Joyce Kim.
3298,Penny,Leonard honey you don’t have to say thank you every time we have sex.
3299,Howard,Yeah that’s right. Keep asking yourself that. But I still love you very much so don’t cut me out of the will.
3300,Sheldon,I have to go to the bathroom.
3301,Sheldon,No. That’s Mrs Grossinger. And she doesn’t have a cat she has a Mexican hairless annoying little animal yip yip yip yip…
3302,Sheldon,I said I could follow it I didn’t say I cared.
3303,Leonard,Howard…
3304,Penny,I’m sorry honey I don’t know it.
3305,Sheldon,Oh like a charm unnamed crewman in a red shirt.
3306,Howard,Look I care about you a lot but we are very different people.
3307,Sheldon,I’m sorry that you weren’t able to…
3308,Raj,Ooh how far into the future?
3309,Howard,Oh by the way can I borrow your bullwhip and fedora?
3310,Sheldon,Fascinating.
3311,Howard,Hey so what was Adam West like on the phone?
3312,Penny,Hey guys.
3313,Sheldon,Oh you brain monkeys kill me. Dip away.
3314,Leonard,Prevost’s theory of exchanges.
3315,Sheldon,Aw someone drew a penis in it.
3316,Howard,Well she was pretty mad. For all I know it’s a voodoo doll of me with a fork stuck in my junk.
3317,Leonard,What’s going on?
3318,Sheldon,Interesting point. You’re suggesting that I have emotional issues below my consciousness which drive my behaviour thus causing me to lash out at anything or anyone that threatens my intellectual superiority.
3319,Leonard,Um not great I guess. But Penny and I are just friends.
3320,Penny,What? Oh. Hi. Okay hey there I got I’m sorry I got to go now.
3321,Leonard,Just… personal reasons.
3322,Sheldon,Oh. Good morning shoemaker. I think you’ll be pleased with what the elves were up to last night.
3324,Sheldon,Really? The only time I’m ever picked first for a team and I’m stuck with the liability?
3325,Sheldon,Don’t bother. I’ve wasted many an hour tilting at that particular windmill.
3326,Penny,Well you have three strikes. One coming in. Two sitting down. And three I don’t like your attitude.
3327,Sheldon,I will admit nothing of the sort. And now if you’ll excuse me I have to call my dentist and see if I can also get my hair shampooed and my nails clipped.
3328,Raj,Oh what a coincidence. Maybe you can discuss that with him while you’re playing in the tournament. Sign here.
3329,Sheldon,Thank you. Coconut? What were you thinking? Are you a hula girl?
3330,Raj,Okay Leonard here I am at your birthday party I don’t know where you are dude but it’s really kick-ass. Everyone is very very drunk and uh…  Oh look there’s a girl taking her shirt off.
3331,Penny,Okay bug report. I just complimented you. You should take it and shut up.
3333,Leonard,Were you drunk?
3334,Howard,But it says eight a.m.
3335,Penny,No.
3336,Raj,Attention all shoppers my business is open for business!
3337,Leonard,Anyway the the funeral’s on Sunday.
3338,Penny,We’re fine.
3339,Sheldon,I’m starting to get the sense that you’re angry with me.
3340,Howard,Come on. One more time. Yeah it’s it’s a little blurry but I think that works in your favour. Do you want a beer?
3341,Leonard,And now the crazy version of what I just said.
3342,Howard,You know who’s a super-ager? Jennifer Lopez. Like what is her secret?
3343,Leonard,Well I took you there. All you did was…
3344,Leonard,He’s not braver than whoever uses the bathroom after The Thing?
3345,Leonard,I hate to tell you but the only warm memories I have of my childhood are of my Uncle Floyd.
3346,Howard,I love you Penny.
3347,Leonard,It’s nice that you called them esteemed.
3348,Sheldon,No trouble at all.
3350,Leonard,Alright.
3351,Sheldon,Oh seriously?
3352,Sheldon,Yeah well luckily someone in the car does.
3353,Penny,On Earth we say thank you.
3354,Sheldon,Oh is it? Well let’s see you come up with an explanation as to why this woman hangs out with us all the time.
3355,Penny,Right.
3356,Penny,All right fine pick another game. Amy and I will beat you at anything.
3357,Sheldon,By that logic I should answer all the anthropology questions because I’m a mammal. 
3358,Leonard,Oh hey oh we ran into your mom at Benihana last night.
3359,Leonard,Well forget it! It’s not gonna happen.
3360,Penny,Agreed. Thank you.
3361,Leonard,Are you done?
3362,Sheldon,Oh well then I guess it doesn’t matter which one of you drives me. Let’s play a fun guessing game to see who gets to take me. All right this four-letter word describes either a printer’s type size or a compulsion to eat dirt.
3363,Sheldon,Thank you. Did anyone touch it?
3364,Sheldon,I told him we’ll meet him face-to-face anytime anywhere.
3365,Leonard,What?
3366,Penny,Because a smart guy takes the nude photos of his wife off his cell phone before he tries to take nude photos of his girlfriend.
3367,Sheldon,You’re right.  It’s a great idea Leonard. Thank you.
3368,Leonard,Why don’t you just tell people you’re a zebra?
3369,Leonard,No.
3370,Penny,Just tell her you need the relationship to move at a pace that you both are comfortable with.
3371,Leonard,My brother was mean to me too.
3372,Penny,Hey! How’s it going?
3373,Sheldon,Perhaps you mean a different thing than I do when you say science.
3374,Leonard,You could be Batman?
3375,Raj,He’ll be so upset. He’ll probably climb up the Empire State Building and start swatting at planes.
3376,Sheldon,For starters we enjoy spending time together.
3377,Raj,That’s a little vulgar for the dinner table don’t you think?
3378,Sheldon,Thank you.
3379,Sheldon,You know Leonard and I were very happy before you came along.
3381,Raj,Okay um It was a card for your 18th birthday. Inside it said Happy birthday Howard. I love you. Dad. Oh and it was a Far Side card the one where the frog has its tongue stuck to the underside of an airplane. Thinks it’s a fly. Silly frog. So funny.
3382,Leonard,Sure that’s another way to go.
3383,Sheldon,Oh alright this is Missy Missy this is Leonard and Rajesh and you’ve already met Howard.
3384,Howard,Can you believe Stuart’s walking around taking credit for this party?
3385,Sheldon,I’m sorry we cannot do this without Wolowitz.
3386,Leonard,Yeah?
3387,Howard,Uh I gave her an Imodium. That’s tomorrow’s problem.
3388,Penny,Oopsy.
3389,Leonard,What’s with him?
3390,Sheldon,Khloe?
3391,Sheldon,Hmm? Oh no no no. They’re from many famous people. See? Oh like this one. This is from Patrick Stewart. It says if I come to his house again I get to meet his dogs. Oh excuse me.
3392,Leonard,Who is it?
3393,Raj,Oh I wish I was in better shape.
3394,Sheldon,Being with Amy has awoken the sexual creature within. When I see a pretty gal walking down the street I think hubba hubba like any other guy.
3395,Howard,It doesn’t matter. I’m not keeping this. I’m trying to pay my own way and be responsible. Taking handouts won’t help that.
3396,Leonard,So?
3397,Sheldon,Oh quite sure.  That proves nothing.
3398,Leonard,Oh. Alright uh… enjoy the rest of your evening.
3399,Sheldon,Not exactly the welcome wagon but I’ll take it.
3400,Leonard,Surprise.
3401,Penny,Wait wait just to be clear when you guys say spa does that mean the same thing as when regular people say it?
3402,Penny,Sheldon take it easy.
3403,Sheldon,Of course it was. The whole plan reeks of Leonard.
3404,Howard,Before I forget I’d like your opinion on the menus I’ve prepared for the Halloween party. The theme is food that goes bump in the night.
3405,Howard,What are you going to tell your mother?
3406,Howard,Howard that’s not how we practiced it.
3407,Leonard,So do we. And I’ve seen you guys ignore each other for hours doing totally different things.
3408,Leonard,You know maybe we didn’t have opportunities like this when we were growing up but right now there’s a dad that wants to take you on a fishing trip.
3409,Raj,Good good. Oh boy help me out here. Does she want me to kiss her or not?
3410,Penny,You’re a good friend.
3411,Sheldon,Oh I’m in your hands. Do a good job and I’ll tell you Cosmo’s ten dynamite tips to enjoy your PMS.
3412,Raj,Yeah well I do. And when my wingman is carrying a Green Lantern lantern I drink a lot. I’ll have a screwdriver please. Don’t be chintzy with the screw.
3413,Leonard,Fine you win. You’re a bitch. Why couldn’t we just have a nice time?
3414,Sheldon,And I told you I wanted to see a doctor’s note.
3415,Howard,Why would you do that? I specifically asked you not to do that.
3416,Leonard,Penny Steve Wozniak was one of the cofounders of Apple Computer. He and Steve Jobs started it…
3417,Raj,Okay uh how about her?
3418,Raj,Cute? It’s not cute. Cute is children dressed as vegetables.
3419,Howard,Thank you.
3420,Raj,I was wondering if you’re free Friday. They’re having a Totally ’80s Night at the Greek. Hall & Oates Katrina and the Waves and three-fifths of Kajagoogoo.
3421,Sheldon,I’ve been thinking about time travel again.
3422,Raj,We haven’t had a good invisible man in a while.
3423,Leonard,And he can’t wait to meet you too. Can I get anyone a drink?
3424,Howard,This says you can make end of life decisions for me.
3425,Leonard,Ignore him he’s just cranky because Bert from the geology lab won a big grant.
3426,Sheldon,Leonard I don’t think I can do this.
3427,Howard,I am a man who can’t talk to women trying to figure out how to go on a romantic date with a girl who suffers from such crippling social anxiety she can’t be around other people.
3428,Leonard,Oh sure. Wait Nancy?
3429,Sheldon,Unlike Hot Tub Time Machine this couldn’t be more simple. When Biff gets the almanac in 1955 the alternate future he creates isn’t the one in which Marty and Doc Brown ever use the time machine to travel to 2015. Therefore in the new timeline Marty and Doc never brought the time machine…
3430,Leonard,I know you-you don’t want to hear it but she was there with Stuart.
3431,Raj,You don’t know me very well but each time you crawl out a bathroom window to escape my company it chips away at my masculinity.
3432,Sheldon,Oh yes. You should’ve been here for the great Jenga tantrum of 2008.
3433,Leonard,PS4.
3434,Sheldon,Well this is very pleasant.
3435,Leonard,They slept together Sherlock.
3436,Sheldon,All right. Please. Amy when I look in your eyes and you’re looking back in mine everything feels not quite normal because I feel stronger and weaker at the same time. I feel excited and at the same time terrified. The truth is I don’t know what I feel except I know what kind of man I want to be.
3437,Sheldon,Yes but as a store owner I’ll finally have a good comeback to You don’t work here shut up.
3438,Raj,Why?
3439,Penny,Okay. Don’t be offended but what went wrong with you?
3440,Raj,You should have told him to mind his own business.
3441,Penny,I love you too. But I’m afraid I love killing more. Like one day I might actually try and kill you.
3442,Raj,Don’t you mean the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Distribution System?
3443,Sheldon,What? You have some coffee.
3444,Penny,Hi.
3445,Penny,Bernadette for every episode of Doctor Who Leonard has made me sit through I will play on your behalf and send that TARDIS back to Gallifrey where I hate that I know it belongs.
3446,Leonard,I don’t think I can go to the North Pole.
3448,Leonard,Sheldon why is this letter in the trash?
3449,Sheldon,Dr Gablehouser.
3450,Sheldon,And I’m happy for you too. You are now friends with someone who is officially friends with Stephen Hawking. Enjoy it boys. You may have peaked.
3451,Sheldon,I’m quite sure. Good day.
3452,Penny,I really appreciate you letting me stay here tonight.
3453,Howard,It’s a little more bleak than I thought.
3454,Raj,The fires of Mount Doom?
3455,Leonard,Yeah what’s going on with you guys?
3456,Sheldon,Of course. I would very much like to read about your sex life.
3457,Leonard,All right I’ll see you guys in 20 years.
3458,Leonard,What do you mean “deal”?
3459,Sheldon, Penny.
3460,Leonard,Aah!
3461,Sheldon,This is kind of creepy.
3462,Raj,Oh. Sorry sorry uh okay.  I mean yeah maybe.
3463,Sheldon,Leonard I’m no expert on meditation but if you’re trying to calm yourself down I believe the word is Om.
3464,Leonard,I called your dad. I asked him what things you liked to do when you were a kid. This seemed easier than getting a cow out here so you could tip it.
3465,Howard,Oh yeah like you have a shot with Zac Ephron.
3466,Sheldon,No.
3467,Leonard,Sheldon! it’s an amazing coincidence can we leave it at that?
3468,Leonard,Hang on. Why would I be fat?
3469,Leonard,Okay so if I remain calm I’ll get more gems like turn off the lights?
3470,Leonard,No offence but I’ve known the guy a really long time.
3471,Sheldon,Oh just because your career’s been stagnant for a few years that’s no reason to give up.
3472,Leonard,I’m pretty sure Martha Stewart never got naked with a room full of big fat Japanese guys.
3473,Sheldon,My problem is I’m out of tea.
3474,Leonard,Oh that happens to be Dr. Koothrappali’s field of expertise. You two have a lot to talk about.
3475,Penny,Oh hey Amy. Look I’m sorry I got so upset. I justwhoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoawhoa! What are you doing?
3476,Howard,Not that it’s up to you to make me happy. Uh well unless you find neediness sexy. In which case you’re about to have dinner with the hottest man on the planet.
3477,Penny,What do you want from me?
3478,Leonard,Are we done?
3479,Leonard,It’s kind of a dream come true.
3480,Penny,I got it. But what I was going for was you know how’s your life?
3481,Leonard,Hi. I’m Dr. Hofstadter. Where is he?
3482,Penny,Oh.
3483,Leonard,Holy crap Sheldon did you just figure out a method for synthesizing a new stable super-heavy element?
3484,Sheldon,But that’s Star Wars Day.
3485,Leonard,No kidding.
3486,Leonard,Come on don’t give him a hard time.
3487,Sheldon,Fighting for our friendship. As peculiar and annoying as you can be you’re still my little buddy. I’m not going to let that end here tonight. Now put down that drink let’s meet Brent Spiner and go home.
3488,Howard,Is this about the space thing again?
3489,Howard,Rat-Man is nobody’s sidekick.
3490,Howard,What? You’re going to make me choose between the woman I love and the money I have very strong feelings for?
3491,Sheldon,I don’t want to. But it looks like you left me no choice.
3492,Leonard,Oh come on no that’s not what I meant.
3493,Raj,No. The moment has passed.
3494,Sheldon,You’re far too short to be Darth Vader. At best you might be a turncoat Ewok.
3495,Penny,Okay how do you know he said that? You left the room.
3496,Raj,And an Aquaman action figure.
3497,Leonard,What do you mean he’s getting deported?
3498,Raj,Excuse me. Oh it’s my assistant Trevor. Go for Koothrappali. Uh-huh.
3499,Raj,We Indians invented them. You’re welcome.
3500,Leonard,One-day rush. I really need to take that off the Web site.
3501,Leonard,I know. And it’s not like we’re abandoning him. Plus we can FaceTime him whenever we want you know once iPhones are invented in his universe.
3502,Sheldon,Hold on I have one condition.
3503,Penny,Shoes for Less.
3504,Sheldon,The year was 1995 the place Jackson Mississippi. Having spent ten hours on a bus during which I had to twice violate my personal rule against relieving myself on board a moving vehicle I finally arrived at the fourth annual Dixie-Trek convention only to find that my idol Wil Wheaton decided he had better things to do than to show up and sign my action figure.
3505,Leonard,You do? You’re not messing with me?
3506,Penny,Yeah. He got arrested for taking a whiz on a cop car.
3507,Penny,I I wasn’t going to.
3508,Howard,Yeah. Uh after dinner we watched a rerun of Rockford Files and then she opened a bottle of uh cream sherry and the next thing I know she was tucking me into your bed.
3509,Howard,That would be nice.
3510,Leonard,So what did Justin say when you told him he couldn’t sleep on your couch?
3511,Sheldon,Well played Amy Farrah Fowler. Let me get my coat.  Oh grow up Leonard.
3512,Sheldon,Did it look ridiculous when we got the Satanimals pack and I dressed up as a Beelzebobcat?
3514,Leonard,Oh.
3515,Leonard,Well we’ll get out of your hair.
3516,Leonard,Hey.
3517,Leonard,Really? Triumphant?
3518,Leonard,You’re asking me out?
3519,Howard,My pleasure nothing makes me happier than the chance to spoil a lady. Just ask my dog. My vet says if I give her any more foie gras she’s going to die of gout.
3520,Leonard,Great. You keep a list I’ll keep a list. At some point we’ll exchange.
3521,Sheldon,Uh do you really think calling me names is helpful?
3522,Penny,Just let me see. Sweetie you know you’re supposed to wear clothes underneath a graduation gown.
3523,Penny,I know. A hammer so heavy that no one else can pick it up?
3524,Sheldon,That’s actually from my list but Leonard would be a fool if he didn’t agree with it.
3525,Raj,Lava serpent.
3526,Howard,I think we should talk.
3527,Leonard,Oo-oo-oh!
3528,Howard,I don’t know. If I want to watch old people sweat I can just FaceTime my family in India.
3529,Leonard,That sounds nice. Yeah.
3530,Leonard,Nope. Maybe another time.
3531,Penny,Sheldon tried to take the ring and I punched him.
3532,Raj,Can I pour you some wine? I think you’ll enjoy it. The traditional choice with Peking duck is a Sauvignon Blanc but Siri suggested an off-dry Riesling. I wasn’t sure but I didn’t want to have an argument with her in the middle of Trader Joe’s. Now what should we put Siri in for dinner? Leopard sparkles or to paraphrase Coco Chanel you can never go wrong with a little black case. Siri play some smooth jazz.
3533,Penny,Well wait if he’s unhappyshouldn’t we talk to him?
3534,Leonard,Okay.
3535,Leonard,No.
3536,Leonard,I didn’t defile your sister we had a relationship.
3537,Howard,No no. I’m just evolving as a musician. You’re the one who’s stuck in the past.
3538,Leonard,Yeah hi listen m if you’re not busy well w-we were thinking you could… well we were wondering…
3539,Howard,My pleasure. Waiter? A bottle of champagne and three glasses. Oh boy isn’t this romantic?
3540,Penny,Come on Amy show us the dress.
3541,Howard,I’ve been babysitting him way longer than you have.
3542,Raj,Okay just the candle thing.
3543,Leonard,You want to work with me?
3544,Sheldon,We have to get rid of the time machine.
3545,Penny,Uh yeah sure I’ll check with Leonard.
3547,Sheldon,Poor choice. Gram for gram no animal exceeds the relative fighting strength of the army ant.
3548,Sheldon,She’ll get lost. We no longer live at 2311 Los Robles. We now live at 311 Los Robles.
3549,Raj,What if we brought them down with us?
3550,Leonard,Nice meeting all of you.
3551,Howard,More than we can use. You see in India we don’t make the mistake of letting our poor people have dreams.
3552,Penny,Well yeah yeah I guess. But look he signed it.
3554,Howard,Leonard and Howard don’t have a flat. They went to the movies. Look.
3555,Raj,I… I don’t believe it this is a terrible betrayal of my trust.
3556,Sheldon,Lucky for you ’cause I wished you were dead.
3557,Leonard,Oh just you know moving… something upstairs.
3558,Penny,Why not?
3559,Raj,Mmm. Amy that pudding was delicious.
3560,Leonard,Oh he’s trying to make a new friend.
3561,Sheldon,You would never kiss me and make me say I love you and then break up with me.
3562,Howard,So couldn’t help but notice none of you RSVP’d to my murder mystery dinner party.
3563,Leonard,What about me?
3564,Leonard,Exactly. We pretend like our date went badly.
3565,Leonard,How ya doin’ buddy?
3566,Leonard,Oh we were following Howard but for some reason he turned off his headlights and went up a one-way street.
3567,Raj,Oh cool.
3568,Sheldon,It’s khoo-vakh.
3569,Leonard,So what’s going on with Raj?
3570,Leonard,And I think the most helpful thing we can tell you is no backsies.
3571,Raj,Oh please. My sister’s much hotter than your girlfriend and you know it.
3572,Penny,Aw.
3573,Penny,Thanks a lot guys.
3574,Raj,Nice try. It only recognizes my voice.
3575,Penny,Oh for god’s sake Leonard this is about Priya isn’t it? She doesn’t want me hanging out with you.
3576,Penny,So I take it you don’t want to help us trim the tree.
3577,Leonard,Hi I’m Leonard this is Sheldon.
3579,Leonard,Yeah sure.
3580,Penny,How about Thai food?
3581,Raj,Not the brush part just the little rubber thing to pick food from my teeth and massage my gums.
3582,Sheldon,Obviously waitressing at the Cheesecake Factory is a complex socioeconomic activity that requires a great deal of analysis and planning. Bazinga! You know using positive reinforcement techniques I could train that behaviour out of her in a week.
3583,Raj,Yeah bye.
3584,Leonard,Why?
3585,Penny,Did you seriously just say um?
3586,Howard,It streams HD video straight to your phone while it’s flying.
3587,Penny,What?  Ew stop it no leave me alone.
3588,Sheldon,What is it now tiny Spock?
3589,Sheldon,Jealousy is an ugly green-eyed monster not unlike the Hulk who by the way also has a girlfriend. In this iteration Jennifer Connelly whom you may recall as the girlfriend of Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind a feel-good romp if there ever was one.
3591,Leonard,Hey do you want me to finish working on your man feet or not?
3592,Howard,Are you sure you’re not him? Uh you can tell us. We’re scientists not crazy fanboys.
3593,Penny,That was weird.
3594,Howard,Wow. I can’t believe old Smelly Pooper finally got laid.
3595,Sheldon,Telepathically?
3596,Penny,So you’re okay?
3597,Leonard,Remember? Don’t ask too many questions?
3598,Penny,The parade?
3599,Howard,Hey why am I in charge of phone support? Seems a bit racist.
3600,Penny,That’s okay. Y ou can just sleep here.
3601,Howard,So how were your holidays?
3602,Leonard,Isn’t sex after fighting kind of what we do now?
3603,Leonard,No I’m fine with it.
3604,Raj,Are you joking? Star Trek V is the standard against which all badness is measured.
3605,Howard,It’s not always your responsibility. I swear this is the same thing you did at the comic book store last week.
3606,Leonard,Hey.
3607,Raj,Damn it. I had Lysine and changed it.
3608,Leonard,Aaaah! I you how can what!
3609,Leonard,I know. I was hoping to go without anyone finding out.
3610,Leonard,That sounds fair.
3611,Penny,No you’re not.
3612,Howard,Thank you Penny.
3614,Penny,Oh damn it you topped it. Should we go to the bedroom and make this marriage official?
3615,Sheldon,Good Lord! You’re ruining everything!
3616,Sheldon,Sweaty? Unhygienic? Looks dumb? Take your pick.
3617,Leonard,I don’t know.
3618,Leonard,What?
3619,Leonard,We’re not standing outside by the U-Haul while you fondle yourself.
3620,Penny,No no that’s okay. Just let me talk to him and I’ll get back to you.
3621,Leonard,Wait. Is brought right?
3622,Leonard,Just like you.
3623,Howard,He’s the Hindu version of Cupid but way better because he rides a giant parrot.
3624,Howard,I read that in Los Angeles raising a child through college can cost over a million dollars.
3625,Leonard,Just keep walking.
3626,Howard,Uh wasn’t there supposed to be a zombie?
3627,Howard,No no I’m just pointing out that you’re dark on the inside and I’m dark on the outside.
3628,Leonard,Wolowitz is with his new girlfriend if you had let me invite Penny then you would have had your fourth.
3629,Penny,Because you’re not here.
3630,Sheldon,I am. Yeah if I’m going to a barren lifeless environment where the chances of survival are slim to none I want you there with me. Why don’t we go back to the apartment and fill out your application?
3631,Raj,How can I be okay? I come from a broken home.
3632,Sheldon,Have you ever paid for a meal?
3633,Sheldon,How come he can say it and I can’t?
3634,Leonard,It’s getting harder to pretend.
3635,Howard,Actually how do you feel about watching House of 1000 Corpses?
3636,Leonard,It’s actually pretty common in our field. There’s not much you can do about it.
3637,Howard,Okay. Come on in.
3638,Sheldon,How could you lie to me?
3639,Leonard,Right. So we’ll just call the middle here the Neutral Zone.
3640,Sheldon,Well my favourite is chocolate with strawberry frosting three layers and if there’s writing on it make sure it’s not all caps. I don’t need my dessert yelling at me.
3641,Sheldon,Two one six four two zero one nine eight nine. And that little lady is pi to a thousand places.
3642,Sheldon,Why would you say that?
3643,Sheldon,Okay there’s a lab animal supply company in Reseda you could try but if your research is going to have human applications may I suggest white mice instead their brain chemistry is far closer to ours.
3644,Penny,Oh is that offer for everybody?
3646,Sheldon,Aaaah!
3647,Leonard,Oh I don’t know. Maybe when you walk into a hotel room and you see a guy getting back together with his girlfriend you should consider doing something other than crawling into the adjoining bed.
3648,Leonard,You know what? It is your life. If you want to have some stupid guitarist stay on your couch then fine. Why don’t you just rent some bunk beds and invite The Black Eyed Peas?
3649,Leonard,Sounds fun.
3650,Leonard,We finished the experiment early so I thought I’d come home and surprise you.
3651,Penny,All right where is tall British Dave taking you?
3652,Sheldon,Howard I think you of all people should avoid espousing the principle that if something is not our favourite we should just get rid of it.
3653,Howard,Well type two diabetes runs in my family. The thought of losing a toe…
3654,Sheldon,Nope. Goodbye.
3655,Sheldon,You didn’t let me finish. And also regarding the bat it has sonar.
3656,Sheldon,Yes.
3657,Sheldon,I’m mad at Amy.
3658,Leonard,No nothing. We just changed our mind.
3659,Penny,Sheldon this is Leonard’s decision. He invited me to Switzerland and I intend to go.
3660,Sheldon,That the soap was…
3661,Leonard,I kind of like the sound of that.
3662,Leonard,Interesting. Cause of death for Uncle Carl was KBB. What’s KBB?
3663,Howard,You sure? It’s a pretty great wall.
3664,Leonard,What’s there?
3665,Leonard,Okay well right now I’m designing an experiment to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at sea-level but I really don’t need any help.
3667,Penny,Relax. He’s just a friend. We’re doing an oral report together. He’s really nice.
3668,Leonard,Yeah yeah. Uh okay. You’re a you’re a you’re a a dirty disgusting revolting girl. Ugh!
3669,Sheldon,Mom.
3671,Sheldon,You don’t know what it’s like to feel completely frustrated. To have a desire build up within you and be denied any opportunity for release.
3672,Leonard,What do you see what do you see.
3673,Howard,Hey look the lug nut’s off.
3674,Penny,I believe that’s what your roommate did to her.
3675,Sheldon,Snap what?
3676,Leonard,Seriously?
3677,Sheldon,A minute.
3678,Sheldon,Army Ants.
3679,Sheldon,Let’s say that I go out and I spend fifty dollars on you it’s a laborious activity because I have to imagine what you need whereas you know what you need. Now I can simplify things just give you the fifty dollars directly and you could give me fifty dollars on my birthday and so on until one of us dies leaving the other one old and fifty dollars richer. And I ask you is it worth it?
3680,Sheldon,Don’t worry Officer. They just love each other. We’re not smuggling drugs.
3681,Penny,Alright I heard yes so… okay here’s my question has Leonard ever dated you know a regular girl.
3682,Penny,She did?
3683,Penny,Really? So you didn’t get all snarky ’cause I said something nice to a bowl of chilli fries?
3684,Howard,Can you believe it? Little Priya’s one of the lead attorneys for the biggest car company in India.
3685,Penny,But it is a fact that it’s a privilege to know you. Totally. A teardrop rolls down my cheek?
3686,Raj,And if anything were to happen to you we will name our first born son Howard. I’m just kidding. We’ll name him Dalib after my grandfather.
3687,Leonard,You kind of remind me of her. She enjoys making people uncomfortable too.
3688,Penny,Good.
3689,Penny,Nice or is she trying to manipulate him?
3690,Penny,Okay guys thank you it’s been fun.
3691,Penny,Nothing.
3692,Sheldon,I am a bit of a unicorn. Well you certainly seem like a special lady uh but as you know you missed the deadline so thanks for playing.
3693,Penny,Yeah well you’re short.
3694,Sheldon,There’s no point I just think it’s a good idea for a tee-shirt.
3695,Leonard,No but that’s okay. I’ll go talk to her. Want to come with?
3696,Penny,No.
3697,Sheldon,Oh sure.
3698,Penny,Okay it won’t be that bad. We wouldn’t even sit in your spot while you’re gone.
3699,Leonard,What are you talking about?
3700,Sheldon,Because it was immaculate I mean you open that man’s closet it was left to right evening gowns cocktail dresses then his police uniforms.
3701,Raj,Well I’ve never seen you here before Claire.
3702,Leonard,Of course. She deserves to be happy.
3703,Sheldon,Raj I highly doubt there is any argument you can make threat you might levy rhetorical strategy plea invocation supplication or… vetoomus that you can employ that would convince me to reconsider.
3704,Howard,Don’t they lay eggs on a rock?
3705,Sheldon,My mom used to sing it to me when I was sick.
3706,Sheldon,I said I would.
3707,Raj,Actually in India the names of constellations are different. Where you have the Big Dipper we have the Big Curry Pot.
3708,Leonard,Yes. We’ll also have time to put my junk in a garlic press but I’m not doing that either.  Uh-oh. I just got an alert. Our flight’s been cancelled.
3709,Sheldon,You might as well just wait at the airport for your flight.
3710,Sheldon,Thank you for captioning my nightmare.
3711,Leonard,Oh so she’s an astronomer?
3712,Penny,Seriously don’t even give it to charity you won’t be helping anyone. What’s this.
3713,Leonard,Come on that’s what we do. We give each other a hard time. Hey Sheldon you look like a praying mantis.
3714,Howard,You have a thing of paper clips right there.
3715,Raj,Thank you.
3716,Sheldon,Congratulations I see you did your laundry.
3717,Howard,Well good for him.
3718,Howard,I understand. In seventh grade I played Spin the Bottle and it landed on Alina Shankar. She said if I came near her she would break the bottle and cut me.
3719,Sheldon,Oh come on. Roller coasters caffeine runny eggs I’ve been avoiding these things all my life. And now because you’re pregnant you have to.
3720,Sheldon,Well I have to tell you that while I do have a theoretical understanding of the workings of an internal combustion engine I’m not sure I’m capable of performing diagnostics.
3721,Sheldon,Who thinks Amy was eaten by a bobcat?
3722,Raj,Oh no!
3723,Sheldon,Oh Leonard. Let’s not take a saw to the branch we’re sitting on shall we?
3724,Leonard,Batman. Batman and Robin. Uh Wonder Twins plus the monkey. Wonder Twins plus the monkey and Batman.
3725,Penny,And stop apologizing all the time.
3726,Raj,Yeah like she could get Trent.
3727,Leonard,Hey buddy.
3728,Penny,That’s because you overthink everything.
3729,Sheldon,Would you like me to bring you some warm milk?
3730,Penny,Oh I guess you’re right. Maybe it is the person who asks.
3731,Penny,Really? You think I’m putting this body through three kids?
3733,Sheldon,Intriguing. Is back on track a hint that it has something to do with trains?
3734,Leonard,Appreciate that too.
3735,Leonard,Hey.
3736,Sheldon,You answered the multiple choice questions in a pattern. A B B A C. A B B A C.
3737,Sheldon,Well it would appear LeVar Burton won’t be joining us so let’s get started. Um I thought we’d begin by going around the room introducing ourselves and saying a little bit about why we’re here. Okay. I’m Sheldon. Uh for regular readers of The New England Journal of High Energy Physics I need no introduction. If you’re not familiar with that publication there’s a free copy in your goody bag. Stuart?
3738,Sheldon,I had no choice Leonard she ruined laundry night.
3739,Penny,I’m gonna go with monster. What do you got?
3740,Howard,Also Sheldon may be a robot.
3741,Sheldon,No wonder you love Christmas. That sounds amazing.
3743,Howard,I still want it on my balcony. I say we move it on a bi-monthly basis.
3744,Sheldon,Yeah maybe you better I took a pretty big sip.
3745,Sheldon,Gandalf but he’s a smoker.
3746,Leonard,So how do you two know each other.
3747,Raj,So um what surprised you the most when you first came to America?
3748,Sheldon,I often forget other people have limitations. It’s so sad.
3749,Leonard,What was that?
3750,Leonard,I can’t say.
3751,Howard,Are you?
3752,Penny,What’s the problem with Goofy?
3753,Howard,Well I was up all night trying to write to her but I wanted to run it by you first.
3754,Howard,You got this buddy.
3755,Leonard,No.
3756,Leonard,Uh-huh. Like death?
3757,Penny,All right.
3758,Penny,We did.
3759,Howard,It’s intimate waxing. Quit looking at that.
3760,Howard,I’m just asking dude. It happens.
3761,Leonard,Hey. Oh how’d the audition go?
3762,Leonard,Uh stapled.
3763,Sheldon,Yeah. You don’t have to tell me.
3764,Sheldon,It could also help me identify my enemies discover their fears and then I could use those fears to destroy them.
3765,Howard,There are just some things that I feel more comfortable sharing with the girls because they won’t make fun of me or and call me names or ask me if my Koothrapanties are in a bunch.
3766,Raj,Hello again.
3767,Sheldon,I just had cobbler.
3768,Raj,How about uh oh how about we might be Footprints on the Moon but your kind words sent us over the moon.
3769,Howard,Oh please?
3770,Raj,That’s that’s very nice of you. Uh come come. Come on in.
3771,Leonard,I drive you to work every day my brain must look like the Hulk.
3772,Leonard,You don’t believe in luck.
3773,Penny,Problem solved.
3774,Howard,Sorry. Go on.
3775,Howard,Dude that’s incredible!
3776,Howard,We’ll switch. You’ll come sit with me after intermission.
3777,Leonard,Why? I mean okay.
3778,Penny,Hi.
3779,Howard,And plus you got a rapid prototyper. That’s an expensive piece of equipment dude.
3780,Howard,Or as I called it Planet Bollywood. Anyway because of my discovery People magazine is naming me one of their thirty under-30 to watch.
3781,Penny,Me?
3782,Penny,Now when he said make a baby is it possible he meant out of Legos?
3783,Penny,Hi. Look at that. I’m in a movie my shirt stayed on.
3784,Sheldon,Looking for something?
3785,Sheldon,I’m homesick.
3786,Sheldon,Cool?
3787,Leonard,Oh thank God we’re home.
3788,Sheldon,All right then so we’re all on the same page. Yes.
3789,Leonard,Oh. Sorry we can’t.
3790,Sheldon,No. Sorry to disappoint you but Amy pointed out that you were only trying to manipulate me.
3791,Howard,Well I should warn you it’s just looking at data for hours and hours on a computer screen.
3792,Leonard,No.
3793,Penny,Until half time.
3794,Leonard,Wow. I’ve never thought about that.
3795,Leonard,You know what we did when we were drunk.
3796,Sheldon,You think you know the answer. But it could be a trick. What if when the puzzle’s complete there’s a sign in the window that says go to the train store?
3797,Leonard,Yeah yeah it’s all good. Everything’s going to work out. One way or another.
3798,Sheldon,Sorry? You may not realize it but I have difficulty navigating certain aspects of daily life. You know understanding sarcasm feigning interest in others not talking about trains as much as I want to. It’s exhausting. Which is why for twenty minutes a day I like to go down to that room turn my mind off and do what I need to do to recharge.
3799,Sheldon,Hang on. I don’t know that we’ve given the alien parasite hypothesis a fair shake.
3800,Sheldon,Anyway I’ll leave you be. I have to oh oh he’s expecting a newspaper in the morning. Apparently they still make them.
3801,Leonard,How cool would that be if we could make one of those a reality?
3802,Penny,Hey if I want to invite the entire line up of Lollapalooza to sleep in my apartment I will and it’s none of your business!
3803,Raj,Do you know how to set it up?
3804,Sheldon,No.
3805,Howard,Just because he helps me out doesn’t automatically mean that I’m spoiled.
3806,Raj,You heard me. I forbidded it.
3807,Howard,Right now all I can think about is cookies and Hawaiian Punch.
3808,Howard,Hi. Oh let me bring a chair for you.
3809,Leonard,Well I’m just saying I don’t have any real ties here so if I were to move to New Delhi we could you know go out.
3810,Leonard,Oh hey. Haven’t heard from you in a couple days. You still mad at me?
3811,Sheldon,Hmm. You know they have delivery people that will do that for you.
3812,Howard,Okay well let me just tell you if we were having this argument in my native language I’d be kicking your butt.
3813,Leonard,Uh first of all you made that guy cry.
3814,Sheldon,I asked for chicken noodle. This is chicken and stars. It’s killing me.
3815,Raj,Yes please. This is way better than the movie.
3816,Leonard,A scientist made that.
3817,Sheldon,You had left the refreshment stand in order to indulge in your customary preemptive pre-show urination.
3818,Howard,Of course. All we need is to find stuff to make a lever big enough to fix this.
3819,Penny,I know! I went shopping today and bought special undies for the occasion.
3820,Penny,Yeah.
3821,Raj,And I told you I get diaper rash.
3822,Sheldon,Hi.
3823,Sheldon,My good sir we are neither crackpots nor wannabes. In fact we are experts in our fields. And while you hide behind your anonymity we stand behind our paper. And later tonight your mother.
3824,Penny,Hi.
3825,Penny,Fine. Honestly if I could have one quality I wish I could be as smart as you guys.
3826,Penny,Say you’re sorry.
3827,Howard,12 minutes.
3828,Raj,Haven’t you been listening to me I cannot talk to women.
3829,Penny,Thanks Leonard. 
3830,Howard,Yeah like she could get Trent.
3831,Howard,Can we please talk about anything else?
3832,Penny,Oh please let some of it be Xanax.
3833,Leonard,You’re kidding.
3834,Raj,I can’t take it dude.
3835,Leonard,Yeah a couple.
3836,Sheldon,I got to run. But not with scissors that would be unsafe.
3837,Leonard,Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to help.
3838,Sheldon,Well of course we do. Fort Knox doesn’t have a secret physics lending library.
3839,Leonard,We are going to play the online game.
3840,Penny,What?
3841,Leonard,Good.
3842,Sheldon,Break a leg. 
3843,Sheldon,Star Trek. Did you see Star Trek The Motion Picture?
3844,Raj,How do you know?
3845,Howard,No I’m still dating her.
3847,Raj,Thanks. Oh Sheldon since Amy’s out of town would you like to join us?
3848,Leonard,I’m not jealous.
3849,Leonard,He can never know that I gave that to you.
3850,Sheldon,Interesting. Not body parts that usually team up. What about environmental factors? Describe the scene for me.
3851,Sheldon,The dietician at the cafeteria with the limp and the lazy eye?
3852,Leonard,That is amazing. How long have you been collecting?
3853,Leonard,You were trying to blow up my head.
3854,Leonard,Yes.
3855,Leonard,She defends him all the time.
3856,Leonard,Well Penny can be very persuasive. She’s gotten me to do a lot of things I wouldn’t normally do.
3857,Sheldon,You’re parched and weary from battle. You stand in front of a tavern that serves the coldest most delicious ale in all the realm.
3858,Sheldon,What’s wrong with your TV?
3859,Raj,Not now Leonard Michaela’s inviting me to a party. You better call the moon and you make sure that they have a bed for you.
3860,Raj,Sure. Let go of the ring.
3861,Sheldon, Penny.
3862,Leonard,Well yeah thanks Jimmy.
3863,Penny,Uh well as a waitress sales was a big part of my job. I mean believe me I convinced a lot of very large customers who should not be eating cheesecake to have more cheesecake. I mean one of those chubsters even had an insulin pump.
3864,Sheldon,Are you sure?
3865,Penny,I know. The four of them work at a major university. They’re all super smart. How can they still be into something made for 12-year-olds?
3866,Raj,Well not now.
3867,Raj,All I’m gonna say is you guys need to stop this right now. It. it’s bad enough that my parents are fighting now I have to hear the two of you? And who cares who’s smarter? If it’s Leonard or me or you know it’s Christmas let’s say it’s Howard.
3868,Raj,Ugh I feel like I’m gonna have a heart attack.
3869,Sheldon,Well someone has to.
3870,Penny,You didn’t tell her we were going out did you?
3871,Sheldon,She’s not my girlfriend.
3872,Howard,How was the hospital?
3873,Sheldon,This is for you. I was going to wrap it but touching Scotch tape gives me the heebie-jeebies.
3874,Penny,I don’t know. I mean you have to admit things seemed simpler when we were just friends.
3875,Sheldon,Perhaps you’re getting a brain tumour.
3876,Sheldon,Oh that was no joke. But I understand your confusion as I am our group’s resident cut-up.
3877,Raj,You don’t want strippers? You’re the king of strippers. The one club in North Hollywood named a pole after you.
3878,Sheldon,In which I am not an expert.
3879,Sheldon,Leonard?
3880,Sheldon,Although I could play the completely unrelated and better word extract . Ethical conundrum avoided. Thanks brain.
3881,Leonard,Yes.
3882,Sheldon,Ah it’s basic thermodynamics. I’m sure we can figure that out.
3883,Sheldon,I must say Amy I was very impressed to see that Bernadette got her PhD.
3884,Raj,Like what?
3885,Sheldon,Yes.
3886,Penny,Oh thank you.
3887,Sheldon,Hey I get it. Everybody wants to spend more time with me. I’m like a man made of sugar in a world of ants.
3889,Raj,And what is your name?
3890,Sheldon,Given that when we met her she was finishing law school and planning an internship at a large Indian car company it’s actually extremely plausible.
3891,Sheldon,At six-thirty in the morning?
3892,Leonard,You have a really good grasp on this. Maybe you could talk to her?
3893,Sheldon,I admire you Leonard.
3894,Raj,Clearly she was sending you a message to take a hike Mike.
3895,Penny,Okay.
3896,Leonard,I didn’t cry.
3897,Sheldon,Oh it’s not your fault. I’ve been to the model train store. I’ve been to Radio Shack. This woman is impossible to shop for.
3898,Raj,We’re just keeping it casual.
3899,Leonard,What the hell is wrong with you?
3900,Howard,No I grew up with a house full of servants and now I have a cleaning lady who is a lovely woman who I have great respect for.
3901,Penny,Leonard stood on me once too but he was just trying to see the Rose Parade.
3902,Howard,What if she wasn’t kidding?
3903,Sheldon,Yes the Doctor Doom to my Mr Fantastic. The Doctor Octopus to my Spiderman. The Doctor Sivana to my Captain Marvel.
3905,Penny,They do?
3906,Sheldon,Because?
3907,Leonard,You’re not dying. It’s just the flu.
3908,Raj,You see behind the fountain that tower that looks like a pyramid? It’s called a Sikhara. It symbolizes the the connection between the human and the divine.
3910,Sheldon,But what if we move and we don’t like it? What if there’s a smoker in the building? Or pets? Or there could be mould? There could be traffic noise. I’m gonna have to learn a whole new bus route. Are you trying to soothe me by singing the Star Trek theme as a lullaby?
3911,Leonard,Yeah I’m going to need a little more.
3912,Raj,Is the trick making him disappear? Sure let’s see it.
3913,Leonard,Oh. He can try. He’d just need a good locksmith.
3914,Sheldon,Oh in fact she has. Uh her exact words were what is that guy’s problem?
3915,Sheldon,The first episode of Star Trek The Original Series I ever saw was The Galileo Seven. Uh Spock had just landed on the planet Taurus II. Then my brother came in sat on my head and said eat farts. After that day I was hooked. On Star Trek not my brother’s sphincter-based cuisine.
3916,Sheldon,Are you sure? Because your proposal suggests that you don’t.
3917,Penny,So how do you know he ran away?
3918,Penny,No I think you should do whatever you want. You know maybe if fashion magazines had female scientists in them I would’ve become a theoretical physicist. Stop smirking at each other.
3919,Howard,I’d like to weigh in here. No.
3920,Penny,I don’t know.
3921,Leonard,Oh not fun. The doctor shoved a camera up into my sinuses.
3922,Penny,Wow I find that hard to believe.
3923,Howard,What are you doing?
3924,Sheldon,That’s preposterous. Tell her Leonard.
3925,Sheldon,Well it better not be more than a thousand dollars. That’s all I’ve got on me.
3926,Leonard,and this wine is why.
3927,Sheldon,The Hammurabic Code is an eye for an eye not a bed for a bed.
3928,Howard,You can’t make me feel bad.
3929,Leonard,I have to admit I’ve been worried about the military applications since we started talking about this.
3930,Howard,That’s so much better than the old ugly ones.
3931,Leonard,I love you.
3932,Sheldon,This article says the peak age for making a Nobel Prize-winning discovery is 40.
3933,Sheldon,MSN Search AltaVista and Ask Jeeves. You?
3934,Sheldon,Well if it’s any consolation I’m sure Leonard’s tormented every moment he’s away from your warm embrace and cherry lips.
3935,Penny,I’m your best friend?
3936,Raj,Sure you remember. You went to the bar and made a fool of yourself trying to pick up strange women.
3937,Raj,But Papa I’m not supposed…
3938,Howard,Leonard’s putting disgusting memories in my memory foam mattress. Can I stay here tonight?
3940,Howard,Your girlfriend and your ex-girlfriend are hanging out together? Oh yeah that can only be good for you.
3941,Leonard,Look she obviously wants to take your relationship to the next level.
3942,Penny,Well yeah he’d been living with Sheldon.
3943,Sheldon,You don’t know that.
3944,Leonard,Uh the big dog is Goofy and the older couple with the mouse ears  I have no idea. We’re not living together!
3945,Raj,Thank you for saying that. Next to buying things that is the best part about having money.
3946,Sheldon,Hello.
3947,Sheldon,If I make this move but I won’t because we’re having too much fun.
3948,Howard,They’re on the chair right over… Oy vey.
3949,Sheldon,Exactly.
3950,Howard,You heard me. I forbidded it.
3951,Leonard,There’s no such thing as haircut records.
3952,Penny,Hey this is a little awkward but my manager says I can’t actually give nachos away. So just take that when you’re ready.
3953,Raj,That’s because you keep trying to stick pencils in it.
3954,Leonard,Affirmative with fever.
3955,Penny,Why are you asking?
3956,Penny,Oh okay. Just like old times.
3957,Sheldon,You’re welcome. But it’s still no reason to have your feet in my spot.
3958,Sheldon,Penny please I’m on the horns of a relationship dilemma. And for the record I had a full pubis of hair by the time I was 19.
3959,Penny,He told you?
3960,Howard,Star Trek V!
3961,Howard,I was thinking of dressing up as Indiana Jones’ mocha-skinned love child. Indian Jones.
3962,Leonard,What?
3963,Penny,You’re engaged to my friend.
3964,Penny,Please just try this one on.
3965,Sheldon,How about this for the app name? The Surprisingly Helpful Equation-Linked Differential Optimized Numerator.
3966,Leonard,Fine. But mark my words this frustrating bogus teenage make-out session is not over.
3967,Leonard,I’m okay.
3968,Leonard,What does that mean?
3969,Sheldon,You’re preaching to the choir sister.
3970,Raj,Oh hey guys. Come in.
3971,Leonard,Another delightful surprise for her.
3972,Leonard,Put it on the agenda.
3973,Penny,14.
3974,Sheldon,Oh. Well good job quite convincing. I smell perfume.
3975,Sheldon,Oh dear. 
3976,Leonard,Oh uh building manager. They have to fix a pipe so the water will be off tomorrow from noon to two.
3977,Penny,No. I said oh my God I think that old guy’s choking and then one of the busboys Heimlich’ed him.
3978,Leonard,I’m going. Live long and prosper Sheldon.
3979,Leonard,Mm-hmm.
3980,Sheldon,Yes. If you’d like to join in the premise is their love seems unlikely and doomed to failure.
3981,Leonard,No Changs.
3982,Leonard,Stitches? With a needle?
3983,Sheldon,Got it.
3984,Penny,All right fine.
3985,Penny,You have to have the courage to end the relationship. You know? Break it off shake hands walk away.
3987,Sheldon,Oh more testing more success more fame. Yeah but don’t worry I will remain the same down-to-earth humble Joe I’ve always been.
3988,Sheldon,I don’t make the rules Leonard.
3989,Leonard,128.
3990,Leonard,What are you doing? Use the door.
3991,Sheldon,Okay.
3992,Howard,I say double feature.
3993,Howard,The gun from Hellboy?
3994,Raj,Yeah yeah me too. I didn’t do anything.
3995,Sheldon,I’m on vacation. What do you think?
3996,Sheldon,I’m sorry I am not going back to the Renaissance Fair.
3997,Howard,I really appreciate it. Uh can you hold on one second? Hey so Howard what’s the bathroom situation gonna be?
3998,Sheldon,No I can’t take all the credit. I spoke with Leonard’s mother and she made me feel better.
3999,Leonard,Hey. Cleaning out the old dryer lint huh? Not only is it courteous it’s safety smart. Every year 15000 fires are caused by accidental dryer lint ignition. Now you’re supposed to say wow what an interesting fact. Come here you crazy nerdy guy. I could never be mad at you.
4000,Penny,Oh that’s so beautiful.
4002,Penny,Yeah yeah I know he’s the wheelchair dude who invented time.
4003,Leonard,What do you mean?
4004,Raj,You suck Wolowitz.
4005,Penny,I think it’s the only way to look at it.
4006,Sheldon,You know the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche believed that morality is just a fiction used by the herd of inferior human beings to hold back the few superior men.
4007,Sheldon,Yeah you had a good run Fake Wolowitz. We’ll remember you with nostalgic fondness the way we do the dial-up modem the VHS tape or or Leonard’s gym membership.
4008,Sheldon,All right so technically it’s not a dinner date. I suppose you could call it a uh dinfast date. But if you did you’d open yourself to peer-based mocking such as Hey Leonard how was your dinfast with Priya last night?
4009,Penny, Bert you were telling us how you updated your profile?
4010,Leonard,Right.
4011,Howard,But you’re okay with Superman concealing his identity with a pair of glasses?
4012,Howard,I have that same underwear.
4013,Sheldon,Good to know. Yeah a few more helpful hints like that you may find yourself on the Council of Ladies.  Hello. I see. Uh what time? Very well then. Huh. That was the Human Resources Department at the university. Apparently my assistant Alex has filed a complaint accusing me of inappropriate behaviour in the workplace.
4014,Leonard,Nothing just catching up. By the way may I speak to Missy please?
4015,Leonard,Let’s get you to the hospital.
4016,Penny,I cannot believe Leonard mentioned the Toblerone but left that part out.
4017,Penny,Oh.
4018,Sheldon,Coming!
4019,Sheldon,It’s part of my sword collection. Do you have a sword collection?
4020,Sheldon,Did you notice the sign on his counter? He’s not a full-time dry cleaner. He also makes keys.
4021,Penny,Ha told you. Okay I’m just gonna clean up your neck a little and then you are good to go.
4022,Sheldon,Why is there never a pontoon plane when you need one?
4023,Raj,It’s just that they’ve had plenty of help.
4024,Sheldon,So often on the front of the locomotive is a large iron wedge for clearing objects off the tracks. Now while commonly known as a cowcatcher I prefer the more accurate cow exploder.
4025,Sheldon,In Switzerland or with the big-boobed weather girl?
4026,Howard,Focused Locust.
4027,Sheldon,Oh good. Dinner’s here.
4028,Leonard,Yeah that’s great you guys want corn dogs?
4029,Raj,Follow my lead. Almost. We’re we’re going to go out into the hallway and uh make a dramatic entrance.
4030,Penny,Okay good night guys.
4031,Penny,Well maybe it’s all for the best you know I always say when one door closes another one opens.
4032,Sheldon,Okay I think I got that.
4033,Leonard,Gee why wouldn’t I?
4034,Sheldon,I have 100 alphabetized topics from artichoke come on people it’s just a giant thistle to zzz the onamona-poetry of sleep.
4035,Howard,Rich parents don’t forget rich parents.
4036,Penny,Hey I did not settle for Leonard. I mean obviously he isn’t the kind of guy I usually go out with you know physically.
4037,Sheldon,Oh it’s nice to meet you. I admire your father’s work very much. It’s not every day I get to meet someone whose life’s journey began in my hero’s scrotum.
4039,Sheldon,I’m coming Woz I’m coming.  Ow! Aw.
4040,Penny,Yes now he knows what bathtubs are capable of doing when you don’t treat them with respect.
4041,Raj,Sheldon you okay?
4042,Penny,This is why I’ve been saying we should keep champagne on ice.
4043,Penny,It’s just so humiliating.
4044,Raj,You had to be taught not to burn down the forest?
4045,Sheldon,Wait that purple flag indicates that marine pests such as jellyfish are present.
4046,Sheldon,Don’t get me all randy. Guests are on the way.
4047,Sheldon,You think I haven’t considered it? You really think I haven’t considered it?
4048,Leonard,That is a lot of cologne.
4049,Penny,Hey Leonard.
4050,Penny,Believe me we know what you’re going through.
4051,Sheldon,No but it’s honest and it sounds like you could use a little more honesty in your relationship.
4052,Sheldon,Obviously we’re no longer a Justice League. We have no choice but to switch to our Muppet Baby costumes.
4053,Raj,Well you get bit by a radioactive animal in a lab you kind of want to turn into a superhero.
4054,Sheldon,Alex check my schedule. What does my afternoon look like?
4055,Penny,Well I’m gonna stay positive. I mean we talked I told him what women like and after he stopped giggling he seemed pretty sure of himself.
4056,Raj,I thought we were going to be gentle with him.
4057,Penny,Nothing.
4058,Sheldon,Ooh!
4059,Leonard,Oh I laughed so hard I burst a blood vessel in my nose. It’s fine.
4060,Penny,Fair point.
4061,Penny,Oh hi. Um I gotta run. Early shift.
4062,Raj,So listen I know we talked about getting a bite to eat in Silver Lake and then seeing the Christmas lights in Griffith Park but Leonard’s talking about a big D and D game at his place.
4063,Leonard,Well did you apologize? Did you have to woo me?
4064,Howard,Yeah if your mom could see her little Bar Mitzvah boy right now she’d have a heart attack.
4065,Leonard,You know if you’re not gonna learn how to do this they make some pretty good clip-ons.
4066,Sheldon,Maybe it’s a new planet.
4067,Penny,Mm-hmm.
4068,Sheldon,You know this is all your fault.
4069,Leonard,Brilliant.
4070,Penny,Yeah it was fun. Kind of reminded me of my high school. But instead of vampires we had meth heads. But both came out at night and had messed up teeth.
4071,Penny,I’m not an actress. I’m an actress.
4072,Penny,Uh I don’t know. Are you food?
4073,Penny,You know I fell in love with Leonard because he wasn’t anything like the guys I was used to dating. I mean I knew those guys weren’t above cheating because that’s usually how we met.
4074,Sheldon,No no you save your apologies for after you’ve had disappointing coitus with Penny.
4075,Leonard,How could you miss that?
4076,Howard,You’re right I should finish the game. I take my plus-one long sword stab myself in the face with it. I’m dead I’ve got a date with a girl. Bye.
4077,Sheldon,And now you know as much about him as I do.
4078,Penny,Hey. What brings you in?
4079,Raj,Hey look at me I don’t have a foreskin.
4080,Sheldon,If someone and of course we don’t know who this would be does ask where you’ve gone what should I say?
4081,Sheldon,No no no no don’t wake her. She’ll maul you like a rabid wolverine.
4082,Penny,You really didn’t have to whoa! That is anatomic.
4083,Sheldon,What on earth are you doing?
4084,Raj,Well I hope you saved room for chocolate lava cake.
4085,Penny,Aw.
4086,Penny,Okay can you please order a cocktail I need to practice mixing drinks.
4087,Penny,Thank you. I needed to hear that. Why can’t Leonard understand it?
4088,Penny,Put the corsage on her.
4090,Sheldon,Fine. I wonder if they make I told you so cards in braille.
4091,Sheldon,Trick question. There never was one.
4092,Penny,Fine it bothers me a little. No. You know what? This is stupid. It doesn’t bother me. Okay it bothers me. But only because she wouldn’t stop laughing. Leonard is not that funny.
4093,Sheldon,Hello Stuart.
4094,Raj,None taken. You should hear how she talks about you.
4095,Penny,What?
4096,Howard,Oh uh Howard was an astronaut. Maybe that’s where you saw him.
4097,Sheldon,Not necessarily. Uh many argue the essence of a Mexican standoff is that no one can walk away from the conflict without incurring harm.
4098,Sheldon,Probably going to have to throw them away.
4099,Leonard,Oh yes we discussed it at length last night.
4100,Sheldon,Huh. Yeah I wonder if that’s related to the 12th century Persian philosopher Al-Ghazali and his story of a man caught between two dates.
4101,Raj,Whatever it is I’m guessing we’re doing it wrong.
4102,Howard,Oh. Hey high five.
4103,Howard,I’ll give you a hundred dollars which will make me half owner and we’ll put it on my balcony.
4104,Leonard,Just give us a minute.
4105,Sheldon,Leonard friends are like toilet paper. It’s good to have extras under the sink.
4106,Howard,Sheldon they don’t have ice cream.
4107,Sheldon,Good morning Leonard.
4108,Raj,I’m in her head. Let the dance begin.
4109,Leonard,Yeah they’re very considerate that way.
4110,Raj,Hello?
4111,Sheldon,It’s a children’s story.
4112,Leonard,Or we could finish eating and go to the comic book store.
4113,Raj,Ah well in this context… 
4114,Sheldon,They would be gastronomically redundant. I can see we’re going to have to spell out everything for this girl.
4116,Penny,Yeah.
4117,Penny,Hey your copy of Science magazine was in my mailbox.
4118,Leonard,That’s nice. I wear a size eight and a half.
4119,Leonard,Not good?
4120,Penny,Great! It’s a little insulting but great. I’ll be KoKo.
4121,Penny,Hi.
4122,Raj,Well how could you not put in an abort?
4123,Sheldon,Excuse me. I don’t see why you get to snort derisively and point that out. You’d be lucky to land a fella like me.
4124,Leonard,Look here’s the thing um I talked to Sheldon and he feels terrible and he agrees that he was unreasonable and out of line.
4125,Howard,Has your uh assistant said anything about me?
4126,Sheldon,So now you think you’re better than Isaac Newton? Oh no wonder women don’t like you.
4127,Penny,That is the sickest thing I’ve ever heard.
4128,Leonard,I don’t know it just came out. People say weird things during sex all the time.
4129,Penny,It’s right over there.
4130,Leonard,Oh I hope it’s just a sprain. I cannot walk into that E.R. with another video game injury.
4131,Penny,Right. Oh and I told her you have an unhealthy attachment to your mother.
4132,Leonard,I’m sorry Howard but I got to tell you I’m a little relieved you’re not going.
4133,Penny,Well what was your side?
4134,Leonard,Do you really want him to write back?
4135,Leonard,What are you doing?
4136,Sheldon,No.
4137,Sheldon,Yes I’m aware of the math Y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth the issue remains how do we circumvent his inevitable rejection?
4138,Sheldon,I didn’t say that. But no I don’t.
4139,Sheldon,I’m also pleased to report that he’s all cried out over you.
4140,Penny,‘Cause I’m a liar liar?
4141,Leonard,I’m sorry but I’m gonna count that.
4142,Howard,There are no rules in hell!
4143,Howard,Hang on. What do I need to do to make you trust me?
4144,Leonard,I’m starting to remember the problem with Anything Can Happen Thursdays.
4145,Raj,And this is Howard.
4146,Leonard,There’s no cholera in Pasadena. Just like last summer when there was no malaria in Pasadena.
4147,Sheldon,And unfriend Howard Wolowitz.
4148,Penny,Good-bye Leonard.
4149,Howard,I’m heckling you. It’s a beloved part of baseball.
4150,Penny,What do you think? Should we go to a hotel?
4151,Penny,Hey. Did you remember to pay the rent?
4152,Leonard,You’re moving back to India?
4154,Howard,Alright this goes without saying but I’m just going to say it anyway. Hands off my sister.
4155,Raj,Hey so listen Claire change of plans…
4156,Leonard,How did she get you to do yoga?
4157,Leonard,Let’s keep thinking.
4158,Leonard,It’s too late for me. My head is her summer house.
4159,Raj,So where’s your roommate tonight?
4160,Leonard,Thank you I’ll see you at work.
4161,Raj,I don’t know. How do you want to start?
4162,Leonard,All right that’s enough trash talk. One two three.
4163,Leonard,You know when Sheldon gives you homework you don’t have to do it.
4164,Leonard,Okay. Howard come back.
4165,Howard,No I was just thinking about Jurassic World. Boy that was terrible.
4166,Howard,Well no offence but I didn’t go to art school. I have a PhD in astrophysics.
4167,Raj,Look I’m sorry I hurt your feelings but you do have strong personalities and always end up taking over.
4168,Penny,Oh sure I see it now the Doppler Effect. Alright I’ve got to shower you guys um make yourselves comfortable.
4169,Leonard,I’m trying but I’m judging.
4170,Sheldon,In the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. In the summer it’s directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there and there. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct thus discouraging conversation nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion I could go on but I think I’ve made my point.
4171,Sheldon,I believe they engaged in coitus but more importantly if Leonard had not abandoned his story would you have found it plausible?
4172,Leonard,As I was saying…
4173,Leonard,How did I do that? I got to remember how I did that.
4174,Leonard,Wait a minute. You hate dogs.
4175,Sheldon,I don’t want to talk about it. But it’s not a spineI’ll tell you that.
4176,Sheldon,I want you to know that I’m genuinely concerned about your well-being.
4177,Penny,Not even the chapter on the breast-feeding crisis?
4178,Sheldon,I don’t know if I can do that.
4179,Raj,Yeah I’m not quite sure how to respond.
4180,Sheldon,Yeah excuse me I need to say something to someone pretty special and I just can’t wait any longer.
4181,Sheldon,But since the arrival of Dennis Kim has rendered my research pointless I just have to find something else to focus on.
4182,Sheldon,Bazinga.
4183,Howard,Hello Mummy. Hello Daddy. How are you?
4184,Penny,Yeah that’s gonna cost you later.
4185,Raj,Yes isn’t she an amazing actress.
4186,Leonard,I do and you’ll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart. And she’ll take it and grind it into pathetic little pieces.
4187,Penny,Me too.
4188,Sheldon,Grass is always greener?
4189,Leonard,If you want I can yell at you later.
4190,Sheldon,Okay so the final four forts in the first annual best fort ever contest or fort off are Fort Knox Fort Ticonderoga Fort Sumter and Fort Cozy McBlanket.
4191,Howard,Oh right uh girlfriend. Okay.
4192,Sheldon,How those nipples feeling chief?
4193,Penny,So is she like homeless or framing him for a crime?
4194,Raj,Oh Sheldon you remind me of a young Lex Luthor.
4195,Raj,Well even if the study’s nonsense I don’t believe in tempting fate. Same reason I wouldn’t use a Ouija board or pick a fight with an Asian guy. He probably doesn’t know karate but why risk it?
4196,Raj,You guys are being jerks.
4197,Sheldon,Yeah. Exactly. You know I waited ten years to see a guy everyone knows can fly fly.
4198,Leonard,All right that settles it we’re going out. Do you like sushi? There’s a great little place down the street.
4199,Sheldon,I just threw up the bachelor party.
4200,Sheldon,I can’t.
4201,Penny,Hey I don’t understand why you’re not upset with Amy.
4202,Leonard,Hey Sheldon? Listen Penny is pretty sick and she’s not going to be able to go to Switzerland. So if you’re still interested you’re welcome to come. 
4203,Howard,Then spell it.
4204,Howard,Wow what a bunch of Nosey O’Donnells.
4205,Leonard,Why?
4206,Penny,More reasons for you to stay.
4207,Sheldon,He wouldn’t drive me to work today. I had to wear my bus pants.
4208,Howard,Look I’m sorry I hurt your feelings but you do have strong personalities and always end up taking over.
4209,Raj,The guy’s a genius. Maybe you weren’t challenging enough for him.
4210,Sheldon,I didn’t make tea for you. This is my tea.
4211,Penny,Thank you.
4212,Howard,Thank you.
4213,Sheldon,What is Leonard doing calling you at this hour?
4214,Penny,Come on Sheldon this is important to me.
4215,Howard,I’m so sick of people being mean on the Internet.
4216,Raj,Hey Stuart. What are you doing here?
4217,Penny,How could you have gotten it from me I’m not sick.
4218,Sheldon,Aw.
4219,Leonard,No. Not everything is about my mom.
4220,Raj,Stop!
4221,Sheldon,I’m in hell Leonard. Don’t stop.
4222,Sheldon,Agreed. Amy I find myself wondering if we should actually engage in coitus at least one time in our relationship. Bazinga. Bedtime. Please show yourself out.
4223,Penny,Good good.
4224,Howard,You can’t come in.
4225,Leonard,No I don’t think I picked her up. Besides I have a girlfriend.
4226,Sheldon,With you?
4227,Leonard,No that’s actually what we did with him when Howard came back from space.
4228,Sheldon,I got the B word.
4229,Sheldon,Well I haven’t. And while they say never meet your heroes I just don’t see how I could disappoint. Who would you choose?
4230,Sheldon,I recently had a dream that I was a giant. But everything around me was to scale so it all looked normal.
4231,Sheldon,Sounds like a drama queen. Oh no. It is Jennifer Lawrence.
4232,Penny,Well thanks.
4233,Penny,Okay are you done? Bernadette told me your apartment’s ready.
4234,Penny,A little bit. Okay. Let me get this straight. You move in with this guy he makes you sign a ridiculous roommate agreement then he walks into your bedroom while you’re doing this Joyce Kim and you still stay?
4235,Howard,No I’m not okay. I feel like I’m gonna jump out of my skin.
4236,Leonard,If you would have told me when I was a kid that someday I would be doing science next to Professor Proton I would not have believed you.
4237,Leonard,Not funny.
4238,Raj,No jokes about the year I took ballet.
4239,Sheldon,A little. But not more than your urethras will be after whatever’s in those pants swims up them. Well I cut quite the dashing yet hygienic figure don’t I? I look like the Flash about to get married. Oh! A tissue! A tissue! Oh good Lord!
4240,Leonard,What about when we went to Comic-Con and dressed like Jabba the Hutt? You got to be Jabba’s head and I got to be his fat slug butt.
4241,Leonard,Want a cup of coffee?
4242,Leonard,Great. What are you going to do first?
4243,Leonard,Sheldon? Sheldon?
4244,Penny,So erase them and walk out.
4245,Howard,Overdo what? Happiness? Freedom? This warm glow inside of me that promises everything is going to be all hunky donkey?
4246,Leonard,My sister’s 38 and married.
4247,Sheldon,Oh Penny excellent. I have a question about these maxi pads. Are the wings truly functional or have I fallen victim to marketing hype?
4248,Sheldon,Yeah I know top ten pretty exciting.
4250,Penny,Well if you need a place to crash you can stay with us.
4251,Leonard,That someone has a name.
4252,Penny,Get them down.
4253,Raj,Uh making sure the telescope’s camera is white-field balanced.
4254,Leonard,I am I’m really proud.
4256,Howard,Dude! I was about to Bollywood this bitch.
4257,Penny,Yeah my bikini region is fine.
4258,Penny,Well remember Kurt?
4259,Sheldon,And now that I have some wood I’m going to begin the erection of my settlement.
4260,Leonard,You can have my car.
4261,Raj,I’m just saying maybe if you people cut back on the beer you could get out of the bathroom and satisfy your women without pharmaceutical help.
4262,Leonard,Why won’t you sign it?
4263,Leonard,Yeah but we’ll be old and gross together.
4264,Raj,What are you doing?
4265,Sheldon,But I do appreciate them.
4266,Penny,Okay hang on. If I go to a bar and pick up a guy and he picks up a girl and then we all leave together did I pick up the girl?
4267,Sheldon,I’d like you to meet Oppenheimer Frisch Panofsky Feynman Weisskopf…
4268,Howard,Well what if we put out a lite version for half a million? You know get the word of mouth going.
4269,Sheldon,Don’t flatter yourself. I’m just ignoring you.
4270,Leonard,So have a good night.
4271,Sheldon,I see what’s happening. Sides are forming. Well if Bernadette’s on Amy’s team I pick Howard.
4272,Leonard,I know I I I crossed a line. And I’m sorry. No no no hang on. I really mean it. And it’s not like when we were going out I’d just apologize for everything so we could end up in bed. This is a 100% sex-is-off-the-table I’m sorry.
4273,Sheldon,I have money.
4274,Penny,Oh God did he make a move on you?
4275,Sheldon,You’re welcome. Anyhow on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being always initiated by him and 5 being always initiated by you how do you prefer your sexual encounters to begin?
4276,Leonard,No.
4277,Leonard,Whoa!
4278,Raj,Uncle Howard. Cinnamon’s here for her sleepover party.
4279,Leonard,No?
4280,Sheldon,Yes you’re in trouble you went to Wizarding World without me.
4281,Penny,What does that have to do with Joyce Kim?
4282,Sheldon,What you’re tasting is respect and affection. And about a pound of Crisco. After you’ve finished breakfast I thought we could spend the day watching the final season of Babylon 5 with director commentary.
4283,Sheldon,Leonard.
4284,Howard,Yeah.
4285,Penny,So we don’t tell people we’re back together?
4286,Penny,Hi. What’s going on?
4287,Raj,Really?
4288,Leonard,Yeah I know. I’ve been offering to show you around for a year and a half. You always said you had yoga.
4289,Sheldon,Thank you.
4290,Sheldon,Think woman who blew their nose and when?
4291,Howard,Ooh ooh! What about we make your astronaut nickname Howard “Buzz” Wolowitz?
4292,Leonard,I’m not going to do that Sheldon.
4293,Penny,Okay. An examination of the economic cultural and political roots of slavery in the Old South 1619 to 1865. What the hell is this?
4294,Sheldon,Hang on Leonard while I have no respect for Leslie as a scientist or a human being for that matter we have to concede her undeniable expertise in the interrelated fields of promiscuity and general sluttiness.
4295,Sheldon,Ointment?
4296,Penny,Oh. Well that’s like my high school too. But instead of a curse it was crabs.
4297,Raj,I’m sorry that’s ambiguous. Is it five minutes apart starting at the top of the hour or five minutes apart starting with the first contraction so essentially like 65 minutes?
4298,Leonard,Oh. I’ll be there.
4299,Sheldon,289 right between the Game Show Network at 288 and the East coast feed of the Disney Channel on 290.
4300,Raj,Where would you go?
4301,Penny,No it was great. He just didn’t really challenge me on an intellectual level.
4302,Sheldon,Oh really? What if I don’t? And before you answer that can I have my dessert?
4303,Penny,Mm-hmm.
4304,Sheldon,Sarcasm?
4305,Sheldon,Okay. Guess we’re gonna talk about you now.
4306,Sheldon,Even though the menu description specifies shredded?
4307,Sheldon,Oh yes it’s quite extensive. But if we complete it we get a free expansion pack 75 additional quests.
4308,Sheldon,No no comfort is the enemy. You know what’s comfortable? Slippers and blankets and panda bears. Imagine a panda bear with Richard Feynman’s face on it. Warm up the car Leonard it’s poster time.
4309,Howard,Do you see the way she’s looking at him?
4310,Leonard,We understand. Thank you so much.
4311,Penny,If you don’t like my cooking why haven’t you ever said anything?
4312,Raj,I wonder what he’s doing right this very second.
4313,Raj,Oh hey.
4314,Sheldon,Oh I have no idea. I never left the train station.
4315,Raj,Yeah.
4316,Sheldon,Only the modern green lantern is vulnerable to yellow.
4317,Sheldon,Oh yes nine. Welcome back buddy.
4318,Leonard,Okay come on. Almost there.
4319,Raj,Well to be honest we only went on four dates hugged twice kissed once and there was a handshake loaded with sexual innuendo.
4320,Sheldon,Unfortunately we weren’t able to convince him to go to rehab.
4321,Leonard,Oh how about we compromise and go on the Small World ride at Disneyland?
4322,Leonard,Yes.
4323,Sheldon,I can’t take this any more.  Bert.
4324,Leonard,To be fair good at both.
4325,Sheldon,Dumplings? Don’t you understand what’s going on here?
4326,Sheldon,I wasn’t done but go ahead. He said compromising.
4327,Leonard,Oh you’re a big boy you’ll figure it out.
4328,Leonard,Hey I said I was sorry. What else do you want from me?
4329,Penny,Thank you.
4330,Raj,The little fat girl that used to kick me in the samosas and call me untouchable.
4331,Howard,You may want to leave the room.
4332,Leonard,Great you do that.
4334,Leonard,I did not force you to go to that.
4335,Leonard,I came here to apologize.
4336,Sheldon,Okay one vote for one vote against. Leonard you’re the tiebreaker.
4337,Leonard,I’m gonna ask her if she’d be willing to talk to Penny tell her she has nothing to worry about.
4338,Sheldon,Yes I’ve moved to a four-napkin system. Lap hands face and personal emergencies. If you like starting tomorrow I’ll add a guest napkin but I’m afraid there’s nothing I can do for you today.  Good luck. That’s the face napkin.
4339,Penny,Uh who’s hungry? We have a reservation at the best restaurant in town.
4340,Penny,I hadn’t really thought about it.
4341,Penny,Why not?
4342,Leonard,Yes. He he’s late because he’s on his way here from 1940.
4343,Raj,Hang on I can see every place you went.
4344,Raj,Really you don’t have to go to any trouble.
4345,Penny,Here. Open it.
4346,Sheldon,So can you help me?
4347,Sheldon,That’s easy for you to say. Your chair’s not facing the lingerie section. Boy that’s a lot of panties.
4348,Raj,You were his colleague. How did your research turn out? Great. Hey this is the apartment you get when you win a Nobel.
4349,Penny,Yeah. Okay. So?
4350,Sheldon,Yes quite the kerfuffle.
4351,Penny,Me too.
4352,Leonard,Sheldon uh okay just because you’re going through this with Amy doesn’t mean that all women are bad.
4353,Leonard,Great.
4354,Howard,What are you doing?
4355,Sheldon,I wonder what they’re talking about.
4356,Sheldon,This is where we could have been if we hadn’t stopped for dinner. This is where we could have been if Koothrappali hadn’t ordered dessert.
4357,Howard,Okay. How ’bout a little Miley Cyrus next?
4358,Raj,Good good.
4359,Howard,Go away. She wants New Delhi not Kosher deli. Besides you have a girlfriend.
4360,Leonard,Sheldon just ignore him.
4361,Sheldon,I blame Penny.
4362,Penny,That’s strike one Leonard.
4363,Sheldon,Oh gentlemen.
4364,Leonard,How were they?
4365,Raj,Pardon?
4366,Howard,A Milk Dud?
4367,Leonard,You know whatever.
4368,Sheldon,Oh I don’t want a broken toy.  Nothing!
4369,Howard,Does the smart-ass know that Terminator was actually ripped off from an Outer Limits script called Demon With a Glass Hand by Harlan Ellison?
4370,Howard,Okay. But you using Sheldon to do your dirty work is like when Cersei used the King’s Guard to do her bidding.
4371,Sheldon,Be ruthless. You tell him if he doesn’t start talking we’ll register a complaint with his Internet service provider.
4372,Penny,Look wait Sheldon this has gotten out of hand okay? I’ve done some stupid things you’ve done some stupid things how about we just call it even and move on with our lives?
4373,Howard,Okay.
4374,Penny,Yes honestly.
4375,Penny,You know what? Don’t talk to me like I’m an idiot.
4376,Sheldon,I do but I feel uncomfortable saying it out loud in front of these police officers.
4377,Sheldon,Thank you Bernadette. That was perfect.
4378,Sheldon,Did you have fun doing it?
4379,Sheldon,That is true. I have a higher than normal body density. If I run too deep a bath I drown.
4380,Leonard,I don’t know. Why?
4381,Sheldon,Yeah. And I don’t understand why you’re taking her side. By being my girlfriend she’s saying you’re a weirdo too.
4382,Leonard,Yeah so just apologize to him okay?
4384,Leonard,I don’t know just having a good day. This morning Sheldon fell asleep on the way to work so I got to listen to the radio. That was pretty crazy.
4385,Sheldon,Would you be sleeping over again this evening? Because you’re welcome to.
4386,Leonard,Maybe she’s his lawyer.
4387,Leonard,We’re shocked.
4388,Sheldon,Doing what?  All right you’ve made your point.
4389,Penny,Well based on what you told me I’m not surprised.
4390,Penny,The exercise Sheldon. Shouldn’t you be getting ready for work?
4392,Sheldon,Then why did you ask?
4394,Penny,I’m not sure.
4395,Penny,Yeah. I’m sorry if you didn’t think we were taking it seriously. We love animals.
4396,Leonard,This is weird right?
4397,Sheldon,Maybe this will overcome your reluctance. I went on the Internet and found a photograph of a 25-year-old Mrs. Latham to get your libido humming. Check out those saddle shoes. Rar!
4398,Leonard,We don’t have an appointment. We we’re just fans of Mr. Lucas’s work and we thought we’d take a shot and see if we could get in and look around.
4399,Raj,Yeah it’s nice to get dressed up once in a while.
4400,Penny,We really shouldn’t be standing here.
4401,Sheldon,Yeah I bet you leave your patients in stitches. That was also humorous.
4402,Sheldon,Unhand me. This is ridiculous.
4403,Leonard,First I want to say that it’s not Sheldon’s fault he tried very hard to keep your secret if Howard hadn’t drugged him he would have taken it to his grave.
4404,Raj,I don’t want to be in a jar. I want my brain in an android body. Eight feet tall and ripped.
4405,Howard,Thank you but if I’m gonna just take advantage of my friends I might as well keep on relying on my father.
4407,Sheldon,December 25 1642 Julian calendar Sir Isaac Newton is born. Jesus on the other hand was actually born in the summer. His birthday was moved to coincide with a traditional pagan holiday that celebrated the winter solstice with lit fires and slaughtered goats. Which frankly sounds like more fun than 12 hours of church with my mother followed by a fruitcake.
4408,Sheldon,Well the Germans have always been a comforting people. Just remember Leonard where your biological family has failed you you always have me your surrogate family.
4409,Sheldon,I suggest no liquids after 11pm.
4410,Raj,So how did you two meet?
4412,Sheldon,Do you like trains?
4413,Howard,So what’s up?
4414,Howard,She’s not hiding. She needed privacy to call her grandmother who’s apparently very sick. Oh and then I believe she has to wash her hair.
4415,Sheldon,Yes we could use science. But it’s your bachelor party. Lighten up.
4416,Howard,I love this time of the year. The leaves are turning there’s a bracing chill in the air.
4417,Leonard,I don’t know. Why?
4418,Raj,You sure?
4419,Leonard,Oh well thankyou.
4420,Sheldon,Much better than I expected. She even gave me some helpful tips about acting and body language. Watch. Welcome to my world. Not welcome to my world. Welcome. Not welcome.
4421,Leonard,Sheldon I’ve known you a long time and I’m going to tell you this with all the love I can possibly muster. Amy’s right. You’re wrong.
4422,Raj,And it’s about to tell my parents that I’m not riding an elephant down the aisle with Lalita Gupta.
4423,Leonard,What do you mean it’s too late?
4424,Leonard,Why?
4426,Leonard,It’s right down the hall.
4427,Sheldon,Oh goody we’re getting a cat.
4428,Sheldon,You’re welcome. Good night.
4429,Penny,Okay I’m good now.
4430,Sheldon,Well y-you I-I’m just saying you know at a certain point in a woman’s menstrual cycle…
4431,Penny,Hey sorry got caught up at work. Hi Beverly.
4432,Leonard,Totally.
4433,Penny,What a jerk.
4434,Howard,How come you’re not shopping with Amy and Bernadette?
4435,Raj,No if I buy those I just go through them like candy.
4436,Penny,I don’t.
4437,Leonard,Will you shut up?
4438,Penny,Nope. I just think he’s really changed. We’re having dinner tomorrow night and I get to wear my new beret. Bye guys.
4440,Leonard,Oh hey on a related subject are you embarrassed to have me around your friends?
4441,Sheldon,And the comic book store.
4442,Penny,Well with all the new stuff I bought for work I needed to make room in my closet.
4443,Raj,Relax it’s Nyquil.
4444,Penny,You’re unbelievable.
4445,Howard,No!
4446,Howard,Well you’re very pretty. That could be intimidating to another woman.
4447,Leonard,Whatever it is we’re here for you. You can tell us anything.
4448,Howard,Yes Mommy.
4449,Penny,Did they make a movie about it?
4450,Sheldon,Great. Great. So what’s new with your family? How’s your mother? Is she alive?
4451,Sheldon,Yes. Yeah it seemed daunting at first but then I realized it’s like the chemistry set I had as a kid. Only when your brother eats this no one has to call Poison Control.
4452,Penny,Got it.
4453,Leonard,Penny’s busy with my mother so I’m in.
4454,Leonard,Oh. It. Was.
4455,Sheldon,We made one heck of a team huh?
4456,Penny,Yeah so?
4457,Penny,What’s up?
4458,Penny,Why?
4459,Sheldon,No I thought we were friends. You asked for a sip of my Icee. If you had your own straw I might’ve said yes.
4460,Leonard,Oh I’m going to take her to a nice restaurant for dinner.
4461,Penny,Hey he may be an idiot but at least he didn’t pee himself.
4462,Leonard,So we’re good?
4464,Sheldon,It’s only one colour.
4465,Leonard,I’d like to refer that to my attorney.
4466,Sheldon,Challenge accepted.  We’re locked out.
4468,Penny,No. You told me not to.
4469,Leonard,Well you stay as long as you’d like.
4470,Raj,I keep telling you close the bathroom door.
4471,Raj,When did you figure out you were allergic to nuts?
4472,Leonard,Are you sure you want to do this?
4473,Penny,Sorry!
4474,Penny,Okay fine it’s soup and a small sandwich. Is that what you want?
4475,Sheldon,About what? Being betrayed by my friends? Spending three months at the North Pole for nothing? And I didn’t even get to go to Comic-Con!
4476,Leonard,You are going to march yourself over there right now and apologise.  What’s funny?
4477,Penny,Oh me too.
4478,Raj,No no it’s a very promising area. In a perfect world I’d spend several more years on it. But I just couldn’t pass up the opportunity to work with you on your tremendously exciting and not yet conclusively disproved hypothesis.
4479,Penny,What is happening?
4480,Leonard,You okay?
4481,Sheldon,Yes I’m still here. Where am I going? I’m on a train. Now what you’ll be looking for is a small wooden box located between a Hoberman’s sphere and a sample of quartz flecked with pyrite. Hoberman’s Sphere. It’s a collapsible icosidodecahedron. No the thing with the time on it is my alarm clock.
4482,Raj,Fine tell us you’re going to have sex with Penny.
4483,Penny,Well what are you gonna do?
4484,Penny,Oh hey Amy. What’s up?
4485,Penny,A marathon? Wow how many Superman movies are there?
4486,Sheldon,All right. This game is called Traitors. I will name three historical figures you put them in order of the heinousness of their betrayal. Benedict Arnold Judas Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.
4487,Sheldon,I’ve long said what you lack in academic knowledge you make up for in street smarts.
4488,Howard,I’m not surprised. Despite his hard and crusty shell Howard is a very sensitive man. Do you know he writes poetry? Mostly about men from Nantucket and hermits named Dave but he does it with real sensitivity.
4489,Raj,Says I was talking too much about dating Claire and Emily and I accused him of being jealous.
4490,Leonard,What was I supposed to tell her?
4491,Leonard,Well I was just saying that there was this video game…
4492,Leonard,Hang on. Black beans not pinto beans?
4493,Penny,Yeah you know like in Star Trek when you’re in battle and you raise the shields? Where the hell did that come from? Anyways um you know how guys like this are so please don’t take advantage of them.
4494,Penny,Oh. Well you do.
4495,Penny,Okay.
4496,Leonard,Don’t worry. Just sit next to me during the quiz and you can copy my answers.
4497,Sheldon,Well that’s not fair. We should all get plaques.
4498,Penny,How did you think you were gonna hide your pregnancy?
4499,Leonard,There you go she has to pick up her friend Justin at the airport aAnd I can’t play ’cause I’m going with her right?
4500,Penny,To the walk-in closet? Sure.
4501,Leonard,Wil I’m begging you just please turn that off.
4502,Penny,Oh that’s gonna make me cry.
4503,Sheldon,Hold on. I have to figure out how to get the bucket so I can carry the mud past the dragon.
4504,Howard,Hey as long as the baby’s healthy.
4505,Leonard,We’re not going to get Wolowitz a hooker.
4506,Leonard,Perfectly formed miniature human being.
4507,Leonard,We’re going to Switzerland to see the CERN supercollider! And ski. We’ll also go skiing.
4508,Penny,Okay great. Hey I just remembered. I still got one of your inhalers.
4509,Leonard,Hey uh buddy can we have some privacy?
4510,Sheldon, Amy.
4511,Sheldon,She’s not my girlfriend.
4512,Sheldon,No wait. You have to drive me to work.
4513,Sheldon,No need we have the special edition.
4514,Penny,Ha-ha there goes your head again.
4515,Sheldon,I just told you.
4516,Leonard,Why can’t you be fat too?
4517,Howard,Okay you’re in Sheldonopolis.
4518,Raj,Dark and fun.
4519,Sheldon,Alfred knows that Barbara Gordon is Batgirl. Which I’ve now just told to Batman. See I can’t keep a secret.
4520,Penny,What’s up?
4521,Sheldon,Still think it’s me.
4522,Sheldon,Yeah give or take. As I was saying it’s a warm summer evening in ancient Greece… Yes Penny?
4523,Leonard,There’s a chance.
4524,Penny,Are are you not happy about this?
4525,Raj,Guys when I look at the two of you starting your lives together it fills my heart It fills my heart okay I’m going to need a minute.
4526,Howard,Well that’s that. The room’s compromised. They’ll have to change all the filters probably shut it down for weeks.
4527,Sheldon,Leonard it astonishes me how you continually fixate on the trivial. I lost a bet to Wolowitz.
4528,Sheldon,True. Why don’t you text him that and see if he backs down?
4529,Howard,I will slowly seduce her until she falls helpless into my bed hungry for the pleasure only I can give her.
4530,Leonard,What was I supposed to say.
4531,Sheldon,Oh we’ll see about that  heads up you people in the front row this is a splash zone.
4532,Penny,No.
4533,Leonard,Oh come on! Sheldon we don’t ask questions like that.
4534,Raj,Is that him over there?
4535,Raj,No I I won’t. I’m I’m unlovable.
4536,Penny,Yeah if he’s in the room when they’re making the baby I’ll give you ten dollars.
4537,Penny,Yeah with gasoline and a match? Sure.
4538,Howard,She had mixed feelings. But when I said Emily was cool with it. Emily’s the best. Why can’t you
4539,Raj,I can’t watch anymore.
4540,Raj,Don’t you even feel a little bad sponging off your friends?
4541,Sheldon,My point is pretending to be an alien is a valuable coping mechanism I’ve used many times. I did it the first time I went to see you in a play. You had no idea Commander Umfrumf of Ceti Alpha Three was in the audience. Oh don’t worry he gave you seven thumbs up.
4542,Penny,Oh just this guy I met at school.
4543,Sheldon,Hello President Siebert. Thank you for taking my call. I just wanted you to know that you can now expect enthusiastic participation from me regarding my discovery. Oh no no no no. No need to thank mNo thank my friend Wil Wheaton. For your information I have nine friends hmm? Ten if we include you. Nine it is. Ah it’s ten. I’ll count Wolowitz. Hello friend Leonard.
4544,Leonard,O-o-o-okay hold on so if you don’t want to go and I don’t need to bring you is everything good?
4545,Penny,What does that mean?
4546,Leonard,I don’t think he had a family.
4547,Leonard,It doesn’t matter. The woman’s not interested in me the woman rejected me.
4548,Sheldon,Yes.
4549,Sheldon,For your information this is all based on solid research stick with the character profile I wrote for you.
4550,Sheldon,Do you know 2001 A Space Odyssey? All right now that’s soothing.
4551,Sheldon,Cocoa Leonard. Focus. I’m down in the dumps here.
4552,Howard,Penny I I miss her already.
4553,Leonard,We’re helping Raj figure out his finances.
4554,Howard,Don’t call her my girlfriend. We haven’t discussed whether or not we’re girlfriend or boyfriend yet. Now that it’s out there are you my girlfriend? By the way if you say no I’ll never be happy again. Not to put you on the spot.
4555,Penny,Absolutely.
4556,Sheldon,Hold on. Bi-monthly is an ambiguous term do you mean move it every other month or twice a month?
4557,Leonard,You called on him.
4558,Leonard,I don’t know. Texas?
4559,Sheldon,Then no. What else?
4560,Leonard,Okay well I look forward to playing with you.
4561,Sheldon,Hello. On a scale of one to ten how light of foot would you describe yourself with one being not cat-like at all and ten being freakishly feline?
4562,Sheldon,Drop axe. Brilliant.
4563,Howard,But you’re not alone anymore. Now you’ve got Sheldon.
4564,Leonard,Actually you know what? I think it’s about time I pick a movie we see.
4565,Sheldon,It wasn’t difficult. You know how when you see prime numbers they appear red but when they’re twin primes they’re pink and smell like gasoline?
4566,Sheldon,There doesn’t have to be a reason.
4567,Leonard,Want to come in have a cup of tea?
4568,Sheldon,Why does everyone suddenly want to talk to me alone? Usually nobody wants to be alone with me.   
4569,Sheldon,Penny I assure you I’m fine. My relationship with Amy was purely intellectual. There were no emotional bonds the severing of which would cause me any discomfort. The relationship simply outlived its utility and I’m continuing on with my life as before.
4570,Penny,Choo got a problem with that papi?
4571,Sheldon,I would snort in derision and throw my arms in the air exhausted by your constant tomfoolery.
4572,Penny,Well find out.
4573,Sheldon,Oh of course. Um is the seafood risotto being served on a train car with the original link-and-pin coupler or the Miller Hook and Platform?
4574,Penny,I I didn’t think it was a big deal.
4575,Leonard,Yeah. And that’s my bid.
4576,Sheldon,She befriends them and then lies in wait until they reveal a marketable idea which she steals and sells to the highest bidder.
4577,Penny,Sheldon! Play nice.
4579,Leonard,Yes. And Howard’s birthday was a drop-off party you didn’t have to stay.
4580,Penny,No it’s fine. Look Sir Isaac can go right next to this little candy cane.
4581,Penny,No. You wrote vows?
4582,Leonard,Refresh my memory. Why didn’t I just put you in the trunk?
4583,Raj,There’s the house freeze frame freeze frame.
4584,Sheldon,Oh hi Penny. FYI the hot water is inadequate on machine 2 so colours only and 4 is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle so I’d avoid using that for your delicates.
4585,Raj,You mean like fatties and uggos?
4587,Leonard,Why don’t we go get the food for the party.
4588,Sheldon,Oh okay okay calm down.  It’s him. He’s trying to video chat. Perhaps I shouldn’t have taken this into the real world.
4589,Sheldon,Wow. Oh this is truly remarkable.
4590,Howard,Not cool.
4591,Penny,Okay well thanks for the nightmares.
4593,Penny,I hate it when you make me sit through all the credits.
4594,Penny,Oh come on everybody loves LOLcats. They’re cute and they can’t spell ’cause they’re cats.
4595,Sheldon,Uh no. The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is a notion and a rather sucky one at that.
4596,Penny,Uh no I was talking to my friend but what’s up?
4597,Howard,Do either of you ladies enjoy the novels of John Grisham?
4598,Penny,Oh. Well good for him. Hey what do you mean more suitable?
4599,Raj,Oh you know. Same old same old. Looked through a telescope saw some stars. Big whoop.
4600,Sheldon,Captain I’m getting an unusual reading.
4601,Raj,Doesn’t count.
4602,Penny,Honey shush shush shush shush shush.
4603,Sheldon,Well if it’s not cholera then based on a quick Internet search the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood are Hirschsprung’s Disease botulism a 30-foot tapeworm or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms.
4604,Penny,Oh. Well you know I I’ve got two hands and a bit of a drinking problem.
4605,Leonard,Does the gazelle with a flair for storytelling know he’s just ripping off Terminator?
4606,Raj,Hey Claire.
4607,Penny,Uh come on good night Leonard.
4608,Leonard,Thank you for coming on such short notice.
4609,Penny,What’s classified?
4610,Leonard,No kidding.
4611,Leonard,That’s it? You’re not gonna make some dumb joke or some inappropriate comment?
4612,Sheldon,A machine that reads emotions is intriguing. It could help me be a more considerate friend.
4613,Leonard,I’m married I don’t have to be attractive.
4614,Penny,What is this?
4615,Raj,Here comes Kripke!
4616,Raj,Are possums cute?
4617,Leonard,I thought I could try to analyze you and get to the root of your anxiety.
4618,Sheldon,Au contraire. When I correct people I am raising them up. You should know I do it for you more than anyone.
4619,Howard,Like J-Lo’s hair.
4620,Howard,Oh an exotic little treat. I was just talking to Siri about Peking duck and she said she knew about four Chinese grocers two of which were fairly close to me. Her spontaneity is contagious.
4621,Raj,Well in The Sound of Music Julie Andrews says let’s start at the very beginning a very good place to start.
4622,Sheldon,The implication being that you somehow tripped and fell into her lady parts?
4623,Howard,Are you listening to this guy?
4624,Sheldon,Thank you for driving me.
4625,Sheldon,You work tirelessly for someone and this is what you get.
4626,Sheldon,Oh I’ll make English breakfast tea. They destroyed your culture. That’s close enough. You know I’m curious why are you so upset about seeing Emily with another man?
4627,Howard,Barkeep! Alexander me.
4628,Leonard,14 is not oh  yeah never mind.
4629,Sheldon,And you’ve continued to take the university’s money under false pretences? Highly unethical for an astrophysicist. Although practically mandatory for a pirate.
4630,Penny,Stupid?
4631,Howard,So what’s up?
4632,Penny,Okay look when you see someone wearing shoes you like you just snap a picture of them and the app goes on the Internet to find out where you can buy them.
4633,Leonard,Uh no.
4634,Raj,And if you’re not in the mood for coffee I can always make you a Chai Tea-3PO.
4635,Sheldon,September 22nd.
4636,Penny,Different how?
4637,Penny,Well there’s no right way Sheldon. I already found a few pieces that fit.
4638,Sheldon,That’s how you start a psychotherapy session? How am I doing? I was promised a riverboat journey into the jungles of my subconscious. Instead I get the same question I hear from the lady who slices my bologna at Ralph’s.
4639,Sheldon,Hello.
4640,Howard,Yeah. You know the last couple of weeks have been pretty rough but uh staying here with you guys has really helped take my mind off of it.
4641,Leonard,Doesn’t matter.
4642,Sheldon,Your doctorate is in neurobiology. I fail to see the distinction.
4643,Sheldon,It’s hard to say.
4644,Penny,Well I’m just asking if it’s difficult to be fighting with your best friend.
4645,Leonard,Oh good. Is the baby born yet?
4646,Leonard,Forget it guys if I sell to one of you the other two are going to be really mad at me.
4647,Leonard,This stupid game is why she’s mad in the first place. I’m telling her I’m quitting.
4648,Sheldon,and then the next day was 73 degrees and the day after that was 72 and then it was 72 again uh then it was 74 and that brings us to today at I’d wear shorts if I had a pair. 78.
4649,Raj,Well I’m very happy for you.
4650,Leonard,Come with me to Raj’s and eat there.
4651,Leonard,I am looking at you.
4652,Penny,This turned out pretty well huh?
4653,Leonard,How do you take your coffee?
4654,Leonard,You cannot exist as a virtual presence. Not here and certainly not at work. Oh good God.
4655,Raj,So you’re wandering all around by yourself? That’s not the kind of hero’s welcome an astronaut should come home to.
4656,Sheldon,Certainly.
4657,Raj,You have a beautiful voice.
4658,Penny,No I thought that would be a nice surprise for her.
4659,Howard,Uh look you and I haven’t made any commitments to each other.
4660,Leonard,Oh hey. There’s been something I’ve been meaning to tell you.
4661,Sheldon,That is the intoxicating aroma of Kadhai Paneer a perfect culinary representation of the freedom this evening holds. Not only is it Indian cuisine which Koothrappali loathes it contains a generous helping of peanuts which would reduce Wolowitz to a wheezing 97 pound blister. And finally it’s main ingredient is Paneer a farmer’s cheese which would cause Leonard to render any room uninhabitable within minutes.
4662,Sheldon,You were so cute huffin’ and puffin’. There’s Amy. I just know you’re gonna hit it off. You both have the same fashion sense. Hello. Come in say hi to my Meemaw.
4663,Sheldon,Fine. You have very tiny hands.
4664,Penny,Little misunderstanding huh.
4665,Penny,Okay yeah well I’m just gonna go eat my dinner elsewhere. Maybe an airplane headed for a mountainside.
4666,Leonard,Thanks.
4667,Sheldon,Not my world.
4668,Sheldon,Do you mean what marine biologists refer to as super weaning?
4669,Penny,I know. Me too. We’ll talk to her. Hey wait how did she find out?
4670,Sheldon,Well whatever it is it agrees with you.
4671,Leonard,See that? I just saved us forty bucks.
4672,Sheldon,I must say I’m shocked by this betrayal.
4673,Leonard,I don’t have a vet. I have a podiatrist an optometrist an allergist a dermatologist a urologist. You’d think I’d have a vet.
4674,Sheldon,Did he finally write a sequel to his autobiography? I’m sure ages 79 through 87 were just action-packed.
4675,Howard,Sheldon you okay?
4676,Raj,One second. Okay I think we’re close. How do you feel about a mini-fridge in my room?
4677,Leonard,Sorry. I’m having dinner with Penny. I have to get out of here.
4678,Sheldon,All right then. Let’s go to the bedroom remove our clothes fold them neatly and engage in frenzied lovemaking.
4679,Leonard,Penny’s not answering my texts.
4680,Sheldon,Don’t you worry about the residual radium from the luminous dials?
4681,Penny,Well I’d actually like for us to be close but maybe we start with our favourite books and work our way up to my husband’s sex organs.
4683,Penny,Here why don’t you put these on while I find a shirt and sport-coat to match.
4684,Leonard,‘Sup?
4685,Leonard,It’s nice of your old school to let us try out our science talk on some female students.
4686,Penny,For what?
4687,Raj,Mm and not a vegetable in sight.
4689,Penny,Sure I get that. I mean he’s your first boyfriend and all.
4690,Howard,I just felt like drinking alone because I’m deep and dark.
4691,Sheldon,Yes or good for us if you sign here and reinstate the full roommate agreement.
4692,Sheldon,I suppose I could spare a few minutes. Were you robbed?
4693,Leonard,Ah sure. That’d be nice.
4694,Sheldon,You say you’re from New Jersey but how can I believe you?
4695,Leonard,Hey did you ever think about the military applications for the guidance system?
4696,Sheldon,I’m sorry go ahead.
4697,Raj,Shut your ass!
4698,Leonard,Who is that with him?
4699,Raj,It’s a re-writable CD. Just put it in.
4700,Raj,Mr. Roper’s dead? You can’t just spring that on a guy.
4701,Penny,Hey thanks.
4702,Leonard,They could show bloopers. Oh no.
4703,Leonard,Mm. I know how you feel. I spent the day throwing out a man’s entire career and all that’s left is an old bottle of champagne and a naked lady pen that Raj took when he thought no one was looking.
4704,Howard,Hello?
4705,Leonard,Oh no.
4706,Raj,I’d like to think the Four on Your Side guy cares about me.
4707,Penny,You sound just like the cable company. All right so shh Tyra Banks is about to kick someone off  America’s Next Top Model.
4708,Howard,Yeah I’ve been there as well. I like your tee-shirts with the little pocket.
4709,Raj,Okay I’m going to play it cool. Tell her maybe. Whatever babe.
4710,Penny,Oh good.
4712,Leonard,Why would anyone claim to be from New Jersey if they weren’t?
4713,Leonard,Does anybody know how to fix an internal combustion engine?
4714,Sheldon,The second I go out of town you throw a Christmas party without me?
4715,Raj,They have that. It’s called Uber.
4716,Sheldon,Why are you waving a white flag?
4717,Sheldon,Like what?
4718,Leonard,Okay let me put it this way I’m doing it.
4719,Sheldon,I was not aware of that.
4720,Howard,You mean Project Lenwoloppali?
4721,Leonard,No. You can leave if you want to. I’m gonna see this through.
4722,Howard,I can’t believe they let him into Canada.
4723,Leonard,Yeah hi listen I know what’s been bothering you about us and I have the answer.
4724,Sheldon,The theory is that if you really tax your brain the neurofibers will become thicker and the glial cells more lustrous.
4725,Sheldon,If it makes you feel any better Amy and I are fine. I mean really good.
4726,Howard,Oh yes we’ve got the moon and the trees and Elizabeth McNulty who apparently died when she was the same age I am.
4727,Sheldon,There’s a speaker box. Drive up push the button and let’s see what happens.
4728,Howard,Well I’m a slumdog astrophysicist.
4729,Sheldon,I was a handful.
4731,Penny,Look Howard I know her okay she’ll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things.
4732,Leonard,Yeah Sheldon what would it take?
4733,Leonard,What are you doing hiding back there?
4734,Leonard,Buddy buddy listen nothing bad is going on she just she just didn’t want you to know that the work on her apartment was finished a couple weeks ago.
4735,Leonard,Penny Penny listen I hope you’re not doing this ’cause of you and me because I have a girlfriend and you’re a single woman.
4736,Sheldon,What’s going on?
4737,Leonard,Listen we realized that uh we’re facing some new challenges as a married couple.
4738,Leonard,Not the time Sheldon.
4739,Leonard,This meeting is a waste of time. Whether we make the switch from Post Raisin Bran to Kellogg’s Raisin Bran should not require parliamentary procedure.
4740,Sheldon,Oh. Oh! You mean something I could do.
4741,Howard,Did you guys see there’s an Avengers screening? Joss Whedon’s gonna show some deleted scenes and do a question and answer session.
4742,Raj,Uh no. You had a long flight. You stay here and relax.
4743,Sheldon,Yeah.
4744,Sheldon,Glory be to Heaven some sort of creature just manifested out of thin air. George put down that Pepsi can full of bourbon that ain’t foolin’ no one and get your shotgun!
4745,Leonard,Face it Raj we crashed and burned tonight.
4746,Leonard,I’m not letting go you let go.
4747,Howard,Really? Because every time we’ve talked about unusual animal genitals you’ve always had some pretty strong and controversial opinions.
4748,Sheldon,Oh I hope it’s a train.
4749,Leonard,We got you that book last year. Wasn’t everything in there?
4750,Howard,Sheldon for God’s sakes don’t make me beg.
4751,Sheldon,Oh. By all means. When I was a boy I would polish my Mee-Maw’s silver. And she would entertain me with stories about growing up in Oklahoma. Interesting woman. You know she once killed a prairie dog with a gravy boat.
4752,Leonard,Bye.
4753,Howard,Are you crazy?
4754,Raj,Look at us sneaking around in the middle of the night like a couple of cat burglars.
4755,Sheldon,I could do that.
4756,Penny,Do you have any alcohol?
4757,Leonard,Aw. That’s exactly what you said the first time we slept together.  Oh excuse me. Sheldon. Hey.
4758,Leonard,Sheldon there is no algorithm for making friends!
4759,Raj,I got to tell you we’ve got to stop beating ourselves up like this. Excuse me everybody. Can I have your attention please? We’re all here tonight because we have no one to be with. But that doesn’t make us mutants. The only mutants here are in these comic books. We’ve got to stop defining our self-worth by whether or not we’re in a relationship. You know what I see when I look around? I see a room full of great people. So let’s give ourselves a break. We are a community and as long as we have each other we’re never truly alone.
4761,Sheldon,Yes. Since their relationship became carnal Penny has upgraded his designated term of endearment thus distinguishing him from those she calls sweetie usually in an attempt to soften a thinly-veiled insult.
4762,Penny,Hi.
4763,Penny,As usual I’m not following.
4764,Raj,But when you’re insecure no amount of external validation can ever make you feel safe.
4765,Penny,I don’t know. He got really serious and I wasn’t ready for it.
4766,Howard,Thank you for forgiving me.
4767,Raj,It’s only a waste of money if we don’t play with them.  He’s right dawg.
4768,Penny,All right well what do you want to do?
4769,Leonard,Yeah.
4770,Howard,Isabella. Isabella wait wait let me explain.
4771,Leonard,Mm-hmm and someday we don’t know when maybe you’ll love me back. Ooh I’m up.
4772,Leonard,Be right there. Hi lover.
4773,Raj,I can and I did look up dibs on Wikipedia.
4774,Leonard,Hang on hang on do you not realise what we just did.
4775,Sheldon,No I’m having a relationship problem with Amy. And by the way that book gave me nightmares.
4776,Leonard,Alright it’s shredded what do you want me to do?
4777,Sheldon,All right. So the topic at hand is sexual fidelity. Probably won’t be relying on Seuss here. Although One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish might be surprisingly applicable. Go on.
4778,Penny,Come on this is huge Raj is going to be in People magazine. And he didn’t even have to knock up one of the Spears sisters.
4779,Raj,Don’t yell at me!
4780,Howard,All right hotshot let’s hear your Indian.
4781,Raj,Well that’s it then we’re doomed.
4782,Raj,I’m just gonna say it. That’s not okay. Why can’t I be in a relationship with a girl who likes The Sound of Music?
4783,Penny,You know I had no idea Caltech is exactly like my high school.
4784,Raj,Thank you.
4785,Sheldon,That’s uncanny.
4786,Howard,I don’t want to be in a jar. I want my brain in an android body. Eight feet tall and ripped.
4787,Sheldon,I’m not allowed to wear my Silver Surfer neck tie but you can wear a bathrobe?
4788,Leonard,Yeah probably.
4789,Raj,Really? Because usually we walk side by side and I just went up two flights of stairs staring at your bottom.
4790,Howard,I appreciate it but I think staying with Leonard and Penny makes more sense for everyone.
4791,Howard,Ooh Mark Harmon he’s a dreamboat.
4792,Sheldon,It doesn’t matter what I want. It’s your birthday you decide.
4794,Sheldon,Shoo shoo! Be gone!
4795,Leonard,Oh come on it’s easy he’ll even tell you what to say.
4796,Penny,Mmm. So what do you need help with?
4797,Sheldon,Good. Oh FYI. After I eat my sandwich I’m taking Koothrappali’s Patang kite out for a test run. Would you like to get your delta-wing raptor and join me?
4798,Raj,My pleasure. Waiter? A bottle of champagne and three glasses. Oh boy isn’t this romantic?
4799,Sheldon,Good. What he may have left out is how important this relationship is to me.
4800,Raj,So anyway last night on video chat I spent like twenty minutes just staring into Lucy’s eyes.
4801,Penny,Thank you.
4802,Penny,Got it. Just had to check.
4803,Penny,That’s okay keep it. Where’s Christie.
4804,Sheldon,That was a valid hypothesis? What is happening to you?
4805,Raj,Okay you’re in Sheldonopolis.
4806,Sheldon,It won’t change the past.
4807,Sheldon,I don’t know. If you’re my X-Men what are your powers?
4808,Penny,Stay out of it.
4809,Leonard,Uh Captain Kirk activated the self-destruct sequence and threatened to blow up the Enterpriseand kill them both unless he gave in?
4810,Penny,That’s so cool. Congratulations. I guess that makes you the athlete of the group.
4811,Howard,And you’re afraid it’ll do a better job than you?
4812,Penny,Uh sounds interesting.
4813,Leonard,Here’s the money. Can we do this?
4814,Penny,All right well you two go have fun.
4815,Penny,Yeah clearly you haven’t seen him on the beach walking around with his metal detector.
4816,Penny,So what’s the thanks I get for turning Leonard into quality boyfriend material? I have to tiptoe around his new girlfriend.
4817,Sheldon,Another compliment! Learn to recognize them.
4818,Sheldon,For your safety please wait in my apartment as I call the authorities so they may remove the chair of death.
4819,Penny,Fine.
4820,Leonard,Excuse me?
4821,Leonard,Yes. 
4822,Raj,What’s that one?
4823,Raj,It is awesome. Uh you should probably go after her.
4824,Sheldon,I haven’t settled on anything yet.
4825,Penny,Okay great listen um maybe we should talk first.
4826,Sheldon,Oh and no swordfish king mackerel shark or tilefish which are all high in mercury.
4827,Penny,Sure.
4828,Sheldon,This is money I’m not using.
4830,Howard,I need a hug.
4831,Leonard,You mean up until now we’ve been experiencing the happy funtime Sheldon?
4832,Howard,This is so generous of you I um I don’t know what to say.
4833,Howard,Hey we wrote the Kama Sutra. If it involves butts there’s a word for it.
4834,Raj,Did you go to your prom?
4835,Leonard,Should we go?
4836,Leonard,Great.
4837,Raj,Oh no. Hey.
4838,Leonard,I missed you too.
4839,Howard,Probably because I didn’t read the instructions. No wrapper’s going to tell me what to do. Unless his name is Jay-Z.
4840,Penny,I think there’s something going on between the two of them.
4841,Penny,Right ’cause it spells menu.
4842,Sheldon,Oh no no no of course not. It’s just I was thinking… Oh gosh golly I made a boo-boo and I gave it to Stephen Hawking.
4843,Penny,I want to believe you. I really do. Am I being naive?
4844,Sheldon,Good. Because I love you.
4845,Leonard,Sure. What’s going on.
4846,Raj,Thirty visionaries under thirty years of age to watch as they challenge the preconceptions of their fields.
4847,Leonard,Poor Mrs. Wolowitz.
4848,Penny,You’re still on that?
4849,Raj,No way Jose.
4850,Raj,Fair enough. Now what’s up with Clarinet? Bernadette!
4851,Sheldon,Yes but she’s the only monster at the firm. Between you me and the wall I think she’s an affirmative action hire.
4852,Sheldon,No what I’m doing is trying to figure out how to live my life now that everyone is leaving me.
4853,Penny,No. What I’m saying is you could add a clause to the contract that he can’t make fun of Howard.
4854,Leonard,– Come on. It’ll be fun.
4855,Penny,We don’t even know what time they’re gonna be there.
4856,Penny,Yeah you are! Just back off!
4857,Raj,Thor said that’s a nice look in nineteen fourty-foura.
4858,Sheldon,You want me to leave the apartment?
4859,Howard,Thank you. I thought it was inspired.
4860,Sheldon,Defcon 5 means no danger. Defcon 1 is a crisis.
4861,Howard,He takes the elf from off the shelf.
4862,Sheldon,Oh snap. So I guess we’ll be leaving now.
4863,Leonard,Sheldon you can’t be selfish we all paid for it so it belongs to all of us. Now out of the way so I can sit in my time machine.  Okay I am setting the dials for March 10th 1876.
4864,Howard,Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.
4865,Sheldon,Leonard I had no idea your siblings were so much more successful than you.
4866,Sheldon,What’s the difference?
4867,Leonard,He startles easily so please no flash photography.
4868,Raj,No kidding. You didn’t make it easy to find. I spent hours digging around online. For the record you have excellent credit scores. And your diabetic aunt seems to be adjusting to her new leg just fine.
4869,Sheldon,My major focus at the moment is keeping my claustrophobia at bay.
4870,Leonard,That’ll teach her to care about your health.
4871,Howard,Oh my God oh my God oh my God.
4872,Leonard,Remember girls you decide what makes you happy not your emotionally withholding mothers.
4873,Howard,W-w-with women. I like to boogie with women.
4874,Sheldon,You’re in my bedroom.
4875,Penny,Well you know what they say if it ain’t broke.
4876,Sheldon,Robert Oppenheimer was lonely.
4877,Leonard,That’s not true. Uh slavery. 1619. Your name at the top. That’s all you.
4878,Howard,Wow. How’s that Hater-Ade taste bro? Hey this isn’t the way to work.
4879,Raj,Yes which is why she was in the telescope room. Yes this is all making sense. Good.
4880,Penny,Okay I get it I get it I get it.
4881,Sheldon,Oh yes. We’re like wild animals in heat. It’s a wonder neither of us has been hurt.
4882,Sheldon,Hey how’s life with your baby?
4883,Sheldon,I don’t want to talk about it.
4884,Penny,What are you doing?
4885,Penny,We haven’t even gotten to my scene yet.
4886,Penny,Uh no that’s not it. Just come with me please.
4887,Penny,You know I’m confused again is he waiting or do we get to shoot him between the eyes?
4888,Howard,Thank you darling.
4889,Howard,By the time I was born Voyager 1’s mission was supposed to be over. It had seen Jupiter and Saturn and all their moons but it kept going. When I left India for America I was never more scared in my life. I had no idea what lay ahead. Whenever I feel that way I think about how Voyager is still out there somewhere beyond our solar system going further than anyone ever thought it could. Don’t leave. You can do this.
4890,Sheldon,Talk to her? That’s all you’ve got? With a cool name like Sheldon Cooper’s Council of Ladies I really expected more. Give me back the T-shirts.
4891,Sheldon,And there’s the first zinger. Ouch.
4892,Howard,Over half a million dollars.
4893,Penny,Until he cheated on me with my friend Gretchen who’s here with him now.
4894,Sheldon,You get where I’m going here?
4895,Sheldon,You accidentally stare at a helium-argon laser. Lose one turn and a retina.
4896,Leonard,Just pick another game.
4897,Leonard,What?
4898,Raj,Thank you. That was the closest I’ve come to sex in like two years.
4900,Leonard,No I’m not shy.
4901,Howard,Hey people were still talking about that party on siete de Mayo.
4902,Howard,Do you know how to set it up?
4903,Howard,You’re not going to prison.
4904,Sheldon,Not technically. In chess a stalemate refers to a situation in which there are no remaining moves. Uh you have plenty of moves available. You could beat us up and steal the money. You could kill us you know. Really you’re only limited by your imagination.
4905,Sheldon,And you just got yourself uninvited. See? I told you I’d find a tactful way to do that.
4906,Sheldon,I can’t believe he fired me.
4907,Leonard,All right let’s all just calm down. Nobody wants to report anybody.
4908,Penny,Yeah sure I guess.
4909,Sheldon,I’ll be right back.
4910,Sheldon,Oh no worries I explained my predicament to our letter carrier. He was sympathetic. His exact words were Got your back Jack. Bitches be crazy.
4911,Sheldon,Leonard?
4912,Sheldon,Danger danger.
4913,Sheldon,You’re right Leonard it’s not a big deal. All you did was lie to me destroy my dream and humiliate me in front of the whole university. That FYI was sarcasm. I in fact believe it is a big deal
4914,Leonard,Oh I know. This might help.
4915,Leonard,Hey. Off to work?
4916,Howard,If you ever need somewhere to crash there’s always my place.
4917,Leonard,Yeah I know.
4918,Howard,No no. Please don’t cry.
4919,Sheldon,It must be humbling to suck on so many different levels.
4920,Sheldon,Kind of busy right now.
4921,Raj,Are you?
4922,Penny,No just keep walking.
4923,Sheldon,What exactly does that expression mean friends with benefits? Does he provide her with health insurance?
4924,Howard,Please Penny let me. We’ve decided to let our crazy wonderful night together be just one of those memories you have and can call to mind when you’re feeling blue or you’re in the shower.
4925,Leonard,Come on I said I was sorry.
4926,Penny,Oh look at all the babies.
4928,Sheldon,This is incredible! I’m so happy I’m not even going to question their judgment in picking you. I’m just going to run home and start packing.
4929,Penny,Amy you?
4930,Penny,Oh come on don’t pout. I’m sorry I ruined your game.
4931,Raj,Yes it is. Very cool!
4932,Sheldon,I have complete faith that you will make them. Good night.
4933,Sheldon,Yes.
4934,Sheldon,Speaking of which according to a recent study out of Oxford University when someone takes on a new romantic partner that person loses one or two close friends.
4935,Leonard,Wow. How do you get an entire lecture hall to flip you off at the same time?
4936,Sheldon,Hey Raj I owe you an apology. Look could you please put your dog on a leash?
4937,Howard,Oy.
4938,Leonard,It’s not a competition.
4939,Leonard,Sheldon I’m not going to defend a big-balled raccoon.
4940,Raj,Sorry I’m just trying to cheer my buddy up. Rotting Zombie. Sheldon’s new Facebook photo.
4941,Leonard,Drop axe.
4942,Howard,What are you talking about?
4943,Sheldon,No look.
4944,Penny,Well I’d like to pick one that works with my brother’s schedule.
4945,Sheldon,Oh thanks. Dr. Nowitzki’s going to tell me about the work she did at CERN. And she brought me this duty-free Toblerone.
4946,Penny,Yeah. When I didn’t pay my bill the Department of Water and Power thought I would enjoy the ambience.
4947,Sheldon,You made me sit on the stairs and think about what I did.
4948,Raj,Oh yeah think about it. We’d hang out we’d read comic books we’d see movies. It’d be like the best relationship ever.
4949,Sheldon,I’m sorry. Are we really doing this or are we tricking Koothrappali again like with the dinner party?
4950,Sheldon,In short anyone who told you that you would someday be able to make any significant contribution to physics played a cruel trick on you a cruel trick indeed. Any questions? Of course not. I weep for the future of science. Now if you’ll excuse me the latest issue of Batman is out. Come Leonard.
4951,Sheldon,A chicken that was owned by Mrs. Riley.
4952,Penny,Oh my God I am the worst.
4953,Penny,Wow thank you.
4954,Sheldon,Bleugh!
4955,Leonard,No I don’t think so. We need to go home now.
4956,Leonard,In my bed?
4958,Penny,Sorry.
4959,Raj,Three hundred and I’ll throw in my original 1979 Mattel Millenium Falcon with real light speed sound effects.
4960,Howard,I can’t believe you made out with Mandy Chao.
4961,Leonard,Why? They’re state-of-the-art digital projection 20-channel surround sound.
4962,Sheldon,I still don’t care.
4963,Leonard,What happened?
4964,Leonard,Very funny.
4965,Leonard,I don’t want to sound like a jealous baby.
4966,Howard,I don’t want to say because I don’t know how much it is.
4967,Leonard,Well she moved in across the hall.
4968,Sheldon,I’ve lived up to all my commitments under the agreement. At least once a day I ask how you are even though I simply don’t care. I no longer stage spontaneous biohazard drills after 10 pm And I abandoned my goal to master Tuvan throat singing.
4969,Penny,You know we could still go. A little rain isn’t gonna kill us.
4970,Leonard,What?
4971,Sheldon,You’re right. I have Leonard and Howard and Raj Stuart Penny Leonard’s mom Bernadette Wil Wheaton…
4972,Sheldon, Leonard and Penny.
4973,Leonard,Listen we need to talk.
4974,Penny,Well I might not have asked you to dance then but I will ask you now.
4975,Howard,Huh. Bill Murray did get it wrong.
4976,Penny,Yeah.
4977,Penny,I’m sorry. I just need a little break from her.
4978,Penny,Why? I’ll tell you why. Because today I had an audition it took me two hours to get there I waited an hour for my turn and before I could even start they told me I looked too Midwest for the part. Too Midwest? What the hell does that even mean?
4979,Leonard,Mom.
4980,Raj,Is that right?
4981,Howard,an we change the subject? Spiders give me the jeebie-jeebies.
4982,Sheldon,Well this box only covers my work through nursery school. There’s a good deal more to come. I didn’t really hit my academic stride until I cut out that time-suck known as playing outdoors.
4983,Raj,Hold on a second. Kreplach?
4984,Leonard,Well now instead of idolizing fictional characters you can focus on the real people who are already in your life.
4985,Sheldon,I do eat dinner.
4986,Leonard,Great. Here you go.
4987,Howard,You know the government funded the biggest experiment yet to detect dark matter.
4988,Sheldon,I hadn’t considered that. We do share DNA.
4989,Penny,What kind of teenager did you think I was?
4990,Leonard,How did she know it was us?
4991,Howard,No. It’s too Brobdingnagian.
4992,Leonard,No.
4993,Penny,Okay all right honey you know what? There was something I was too scared to tell you yesterday and now I’m just balls-out terrified to tell you but the truth is it wasn’t Barbara Chen it was me. I’m the reason everyone knows.
4994,Howard,You know he’s British I’m Indian ever since Gandhi they haven’t liked us very much.
4995,Leonard,Buddy I think Amy might be upset.
4996,Raj,Hello.
4997,Penny,Oh okay well maybe you should start heading on out then.
4998,Leonard,Hey.
4999,Howard,So I found this Web site where you send them pictures they sculpt your head and make an action figure out of you. How awesome is that?
5000,Leonard,Guys it’s stolen. It should go back to Peter Jackson. He made the movies it belongs to him.
5001,Leonard,I know. I thought we’d take yours.
5002,Penny,It does have a camera in it.
5003,Sheldon,Sarcasm?
5004,Sheldon,Good Lord I made you tea just drink it.
5005,Howard,No it’s not. I haven’t had a drink since last night.
5007,Raj,Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!
5008,Penny,No I meant that as a regret.
5009,Sheldon,Thank you so much. I can’t believe you’re…
5010,Howard,I thought Stuart was looking after her.
5011,Sheldon,I’m the guy.
5012,Penny,Yeah?
5013,Leonard,I’m going to go let Penny know we’re back.
5014,Howard,You’re wrong. It’s only a matter of time before you fall into Rat-Man’s rat trap.
5015,Sheldon,Won’t that spoil our appetites for the chicken you’re going to make me?
5016,Leonard,Hey I’m just thrilled we’re all getting along for a minute.
5017,Penny,Oh yeah.
5018,Howard,Whatever you like.
5019,Sheldon,Certainly. It’s not like I have to moderate my food intake because I’m planning on eating again very shortly. Mm mm mm!
5020,Sheldon,I’m sorry. Wolowitz would never play that card.
5021,Leonard,Okay I think a bit of context here might help.
5022,Sheldon,Help me open it.
5023,Penny,As long as you don’t feel it running down your pants you’re fine.
5024,Sheldon,I still don’t like this cushion.
5025,Penny,I think we should talk now.
5026,Penny,Um yeah if you want. I mean there may not be room. He’s got a lot of stuff like guitars and amplifiers.
5027,Raj,It’s like we both had these holes in our lives but now we fill each other’s holes.
5028,Leonard,You lie down he’ll be here in a minute.
5029,Leonard,I’m going back to bed.
5030,Howard,I want a picture with Nathan Fillion.
5031,Leonard,Anyway I’ve learned my lesson. She’s out of my league I’m done with her I’ve got my work one day I’ll win the Nobel Prize and then I’ll die alone.
5032,Howard,Yeah I calmed her down but she’s not going to Vegas if he’s going.
5033,Leonard,Great.
5034,Sheldon,If it wanted to kill you you’d be dead.
5035,Sheldon,No that train has left the station. Now we can play this one of two ways. You can say trains tell me more or you can just look at me like that and I’ll start.
5036,Leonard,Uh uh uh yes I did.
5037,Sheldon,You see? People have been pointing and laughing at me all morning.
5038,Sheldon,Leonard?
5039,Leonard,No no I do. It’s just I knew I was having curry tonight and I only want one part of my body to burn at a time.
5040,Howard,Why? You never thought you’d end up in a relationship and then you met Amy. Maybe there’s someone else out there for you.
5041,Sheldon,Go go Power Rangers go!
5042,Raj,Yes.
5043,Raj,I can’t believe I’m sitting here next to little Lalita Gupta.
5044,Leonard,She’s gone Sheldon.
5045,Sheldon,No. But thank you for asking.
5046,Leonard,Maybe this isn’t a good idea.
5047,Sheldon,I think the time has come to acknowledge that we are paying the price for some of us failing to attend my Physics Department paintball strategy meeting.
5048,Penny,All right well can’t you like slip him some money or something?
5049,Sheldon,I can see how that would be upsetting. Come in. I’ll get the sheets and blankets for the couch.
5050,Leonard,Won’t my footsteps set it off?
5051,Sheldon,All he had was an idea.
5052,Sheldon,He asked her out once it was an embarrassing failure.
5053,Leonard,That’ll do it.
5054,Leonard,Hey guys can I just say something? How about we take a moment to think about where we are right now? This is literally the top of the world. Only a handful of people in all of human history will ever see what we are going to see.
5055,Penny,It’s ridiculous.
5056,Sheldon,Oh sure. And while we’re at it why don’t we put our hands behind our backs have an old-fashioned eating contest?
5057,Howard,You didn’t think I was gonna be in your kitchen this morning yet here I am.
5058,Leonard,Yeah.
5059,Sheldon,Is it? Listen.
5060,Leonard,Yeah. It kind of rekindles your faith in the basic goodness of people.
5061,Sheldon,Impressive.
5062,Leonard,How am I supposed to let it go? You used me for sex! Morning Mrs. Gunderson.
5063,Leonard,Yes.
5064,Raj,If you really want to challenge yourself you could learn to speak Hindi.
5066,Penny,Any ideas Raj? 
5067,Howard,The big-boobed weather girl on Channel 2?
5069,Raj,Okay. Here’s where we derive the mass of the dark matter particle.
5070,Sheldon,You’re making an assumption. Perhaps the comic book store is on fire and he needs your assistance.
5071,Raj,You know if you think about it tonight was kind of like a real-life Game of Thrones.
5072,Sheldon,Because you chose your mother’s veins over victory. On three. One two three go!
5074,Sheldon,Yeah well I’ve had a lot on my plate. We happen to live in a golden age of television.
5075,Sheldon,There it is. What if someone asks?
5076,Sheldon,Oh that hardly seems fair. But I guess any team that I’m not on has a decided disadvantage.
5077,Howard,Oh grow up.
5078,Penny,Of course I do. You’re an important part of my life and I pay attention to the things you are interested in.
5079,Leonard,Good morning.
5080,Penny,Okay you’re cut off. Anybody need a refill?
5082,Penny,Sweetie can I just be the girl tonight?
5083,Leonard,Well you didn’t read it right. The new Star Wars is coming. Gah.
5084,Leonard,Maybe it’s a lingering bacterial infection from all those childhood toilet swirlies.
5085,Sheldon,What kinds of things?
5086,Leonard,Yes.
5087,Sheldon,True. Sorry kid you’ve got it worse than a gibbon.
5088,Howard,I know. Blue shag what were you thinking?
5089,Leonard,What were you doing in his closet?
5090,Sheldon,Now if you’ll excuse me I’m off to buy a pussycat.
5091,Penny,But come on that is a great movie and it starts in ten minutes.
5092,Raj,Not until now.
5093,Penny,Yeah. You’re gonna be on Skype they’re not gonna see your legs.
5094,Sheldon,Because in the frigid temperatures in the Arctic we need to consume at least 5000 calories a day just to maintain our body weight.
5095,Leonard,Well I brought my moneymaker. Let me shake it.
5096,Leonard,Thanks. You too. You know go ahead and take it.
5097,Raj,You are but you’ve got kind of a big personality with your flashy clothes and your Woody Allen swagger.
5098,Howard,Uh actually I’m seeing both of them.
5099,Penny,That’s a great idea.
5100,Howard,This is exciting.
5101,Penny,Well my beer isn’t flat and my rack’s not saggy. So far the future’s great.
5102,Howard,I’ll take the job. See you Monday.
5103,Penny,Oh what are we gonna do?
5104,Sheldon,Sexual insecurity.
5105,Penny,I… I don’t…
5106,Sheldon,All right. All right I’m not going to argue with you. Sheldon Cooper is nothing if not a team player. Dr. Hofstadter you have the conn.
5107,Penny,Hey I don’t want you to go any more.
5108,Sheldon,Yes yes the disappointing sex. That’s an inexact parallel. You and Leonard can always return to being friends whereas I can never return to a state in which Wolowitz has not bested me like Mrs. Riley’s chicken.
5109,Raj,Oh my pleasure and don’t worry about your presentation today. You’re gonna be great.
5110,Sheldon,I thought we were talking about the other thing.
5111,Sheldon,Yes please.  How may I help you?
5112,Raj,I don’t appreciate your sarcasm but we’ve still got two blocks to go so I’ll put up with it.
5113,Leonard,Sheldon go to bed. You have work in the morning.
5114,Leonard,What?
5115,Penny,Is there anything we can do to help?
5116,Leonard,No you’re done. I want you out of my apartment right now.
5117,Sheldon,All right my plan is predicated on the assumption that they have a nurse’s office and your willingness to be lightly stabbed.
5118,Sheldon,But the flash drive is in a locked drawer in my desk.
5119,Sheldon,But after months of struggling I’m finally making progress.
5120,Penny,Oh hey.
5121,Penny,So?
5122,Sheldon,Hello. Uh is this the Bruce Miller who wrote the season finale of Alphas? Oh smashing. Yeah you already sound nicer than the last Bruce Miller who suggested I have sexual relations with myself. Now down to business. Um your show ended on a cliffhanger. Could you please tell me how you planned to resolve it? Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. I see. Well that all stinks. No wonder you got cancelled. Bye.
5123,Sheldon,It probably won’t.
5124,Leonard,I’m gonna go talk to Penny.
5125,Penny,Yeah but he doesn’t live here anymore.
5126,Leonard,No he’s fine. We just needed a little break.
5127,Sheldon,She’s always complaining about people at work.
5128,Leonard,Absolutely.
5129,Penny,No it’s not a big deal. Just taking a class at the Pasadena Community College.
5130,Leonard,Keep your voice down.
5131,Penny,Which is?
5132,Howard,Really smart guy? Where’s he supposed to park his sweet little Corvette?
5133,Sheldon,Confound it! You’re right it’s brilliant. Let’s take it from the top.
5134,Sheldon,Professor Hawking how nice of you to call.
5135,Leonard,Sheldon we’ve been through this. I’m taking Penny.
5136,Leonard,Mm it’s complicated but as I remember it the essentials are get chosen last get hit by the ball cry go home.
5137,Leonard,Because you were being selfish.
5138,Penny,Coming. Yup that’s good. Wine glasses should have handles.
5139,Sheldon,Okay.
5140,Leonard,Hey Sheldon sent us all an e-mail. Happy holidays from Texas. And there’s pictures. Aah! Don’t open them. Do not open them.
5141,Penny,Oh Leonard?
5142,Howard,It is if you love her and give her a name.
5143,Leonard,Okay well how about this. Until Priya gets her own place you stay here and I’ll stay at your apartment.
5144,Leonard,What?
5145,Penny,He was drunk.
5146,Leonard,Fun. Like your Comic-Con Spock ears and your around the house Spock ears.
5147,Leonard,How was your family?
5148,Howard,I love kids how old is he?
5149,Penny,Okay if you think it’ll help. Oh just don’t make it Placinex. I do not need sudden fits of homicidal rage.
5150,Penny,Yeah. This is crazy.
5151,Sheldon, Penny.
5152,Leonard,I’m fine. That’s nice that they’re getting along.
5153,Sheldon,If you know so much how come I have a date tonight and you have nothing better to do than drive me to it?
5154,Sheldon,I suppose there is a history of professional women using their initials so as not to be pre-judged. Harry Potter’s J.K. Rowling uh Star Trek’s D.C. Fontana.
5155,Sheldon,Can you pass the Parmesan cheese?
5156,Sheldon,At home forbidding it.
5158,Penny,W wait a minute. You mention his birthday and he vanishes?
5159,Howard,Mm and not a vegetable in sight.
5160,Sheldon,Well you should be. My discovery is spreading like wildfire. Unlike my mole which is holding steady at the size of a navy bean.
5162,Sheldon,Fine. The new issue of Flash is out.
5163,Sheldon,And boring her words.
5164,Leonard,Oh that’s the bottled city of Kandor.
5165,Penny,Bam. Thank you. What’s her name?
5166,Leonard,There’s a sniper use your rocket launcher.
5167,Sheldon,I’m trying to get the hair out of my eyes.
5168,Penny,Soon.
5169,Howard,Okay. How about that one.
5170,Raj,All right. You’ve paid for a sweater and you’re in Sheldon Square.
5171,Sheldon,No. We’re going to start Season Two of Battlestar Galactica.
5172,Howard,Oh I wish I was in better shape.
5173,Sheldon,What are you doing? Two fifty is already the discounted price.
5174,Leonard,A grad student forgot to take out one of his piercings. Now he’s on a transplant list waiting for a nipple his size. Now watch this.
5175,Penny,Hey Sheldon.
5176,Penny,Yeah. Yeah sometimes I worry you’re gonna wake up and leave me for someone more like you.
5177,Leonard,Oh. That’s too bad. I wonder what happened.
5178,Leonard,Sheldon if you really need to do this I’m not gonna stand in your way.
5179,Penny,Sheldon we are just people. We talk about the same things you guys talk about.
5180,Sheldon,Oh. Is it true that you were pre-med in college and you almost became a doctor?
5181,Sheldon,All right fine she doesn’t need her own point of view. Now chop-chop.
5182,Sheldon,He’s an odd duck isn’t he?
5183,Sheldon,Aced it.
5184,Leonard,No.
5185,Sheldon,My mother dragged me there and she plopped me down on your lap and you asked me what I wanted for Christmas. And I told you my Pop-Pop because that was the year my grandfather died. I missed him and I wanted him back.
5186,Leonard,Now you know why we’re not outside.
5187,Penny,I’ll be right there. Bernadette’s just parking the car.
5188,Sheldon,I hope so because if this is well life isn’t worth living.
5189,Howard,I think we should take a picture to capture this moment.
5190,Penny,Have fun Sheldon.
5191,Sheldon,She’s my twin sister she thinks she’s funny but frankly I’ve never been able to see it.
5192,Sheldon,Uh-duh hold on hold on!
5193,Leonard,Do I get a card?
5194,Penny,Time to do your laundry huh?
5195,Penny,Well that was fun.
5196,Leonard,Um…
5197,Howard,Oh man that is so us.
5198,Penny,What’s going on?
5199,Penny,What’s that?
5200,Howard,No not a thing.
5201,Sheldon,In addition I really don’t think that Leonard wants a…
5202,Penny,Sweetie you are weird. Everyone knows you’re weird but they’re all still here because they care about you so much.
5203,Leonard,No he looks like a grown man. You’ve seen Freaky Friday sometimes little kids end up in big person bodies.
5204,Sheldon,Okay. That was tricky ’cause when it comes to alcohol she generally means business.
5205,Sheldon,It’s a quark-gluon plasma.
5206,Sheldon,You mean this ring? Next time be aware of your surroundings while urinating in a public men’s room.
5207,Penny,Okay Kurt please.
5208,Sheldon,All right. We have seven people and two cars. In the lead car driven by Leonard will be myself Amy Farrah Fowler and Penny.
5209,Leonard,Wait a minute– a child? You never see this girl. You just e-mail and text and Twitter. Now you’re considering having a baby?
5210,Penny,Entertain them.
5211,Leonard,In any case they’re asking me to fill in for him.
5212,Howard,Thank you. Good luck with your future endeavours.
5213,Penny,Yes we win again.
5214,Penny,Paul.
5215,Penny,Okay now that I’ve been completely insulted have a good flight.
5216,Raj,I’m sorry I don’t think that’s a good idea.
5217,Leonard,Actually it would help.
5218,Howard,Eight for 28.
5220,Sheldon,Well as long as it has a healthy gravity and all its moons I’ll be happy.
5221,Howard,It’s a little early isn’t it?
5222,Howard,Remember that little planetary object I spotted beyond the Kuiper belt?
5223,Leonard,What brought this on?
5224,Leonard,Well maybe we shouldn’t have sunk to his level.
5225,Penny,No no I like that show. It’s got dragons and people doing it.
5226,Leonard,No admit that you contaminated the clean room.
5227,Raj,Are you crying?
5228,Leonard,Really? Do you know how much those Lakers tickets were?
5229,Leonard,I’m gonna do it. I’m gonna ask her out.
5230,Howard,Well you say it like it’s easy. Have any one of you ever broken up with anyone?
5231,Penny,Whoa whoa whoa whoa!
5232,Sheldon,Grape. I find it the most mild.
5233,Leonard,Oh. This is the thing about me standing up to him and not letting him run my life?
5234,Sheldon,I should have asked for much more than a comic book and a robot.
5235,Leonard,Yeah well  Sheldon’s still up.
5236,Penny,Now you just get comfortable.
5237,Raj,Sure. Tell us again how you screwed up and got Penny back together with her old boyfriend.
5238,Leonard,Hey Sheldon I was up in the administration office and I happened to overhear the name of the winner of this year’s Chancellor’s Award for Science.
5240,Sheldon,Look you’re gonna be doing this stuff for a while. You’re just gonna have to find a way to get used to it.
5241,Penny,Yeah.
5242,Leonard,So what do you think is there a professional downside to doing it?
5243,Sheldon,Oh yes Priya. Leonard you know I make a point of never interfering in your personal affairs.
5244,Leonard,You don’t need air bags.
5245,Sheldon,Now it’s a fun fact.
5246,Penny,And the wave is gone.
5247,Howard,You know I struggle with Batman.
5248,Sheldon,Oh good grief.
5249,Sheldon,Again urban slang. In which I believe I’m gaining remarkable fluency. So what is the down and the low? And don’t worry this is all entirely confidential so you feel free to include any and all shortcomings in the bedroom.
5250,Sheldon,I’m trying to raise the temperature in here before my nipples tear through my shirt.
5251,Leonard,Oh very. Assuming she takes my call.
5252,Penny,Yeah well it almost killed me.
5253,Sheldon,I can see that. Unless you’re planning on running a marathon choosing both stuffing and mashed potatoes is a starch filled redundancy.
5254,Leonard,These are pretty god what flavour is this?
5255,Penny,So not funny dad.
5256,Leonard,No no she’s too proud to ask for the money. I on the other hand feel you should honour your debt.
5257,Leonard,Yeah just going to a restaurant get some steaks and scotch. Nothing to worry about.
5258,Raj,Also since the time machine doesn’t move in space you’ll end up in 1876 Pasadena.
5259,Leonard,That I would do to her.
5260,Sheldon,I’m sorry Raj I have no desire to salute any article of clothing tonight. Much less one that’s linked to race riots in the 1940s.
5261,Sheldon,We just went swimming.
5262,Sheldon,Ah then again what are the odds of someone attacking me?
5263,Penny,Hey.
5264,Sheldon,I’m trying to determine whether crying infants above my head are a possibility.
5265,Leonard,Just a whole lot of Afrin.
5266,Leonard,You do?
5267,Leonard,Thank you.
5268,Penny,I don’t know I make a movie become rich and famous win an Oscar a Golden Globe and live an incredibly wonderful life.
5269,Sheldon,Oh Dr. and Mrs. Hofstadter lovely to see you this fine morning.
5270,Sheldon,Bye.
5271,Sheldon,Worst Renaissance Fair ever.
5272,Sheldon,What are you talking about?
5273,Sheldon,I believe my alarm is appropriate given the situation. The movie starts in 17 minutes which means we’ll need to make all the lights on Colorado Boulevard plus skip the concession stand and preshow urination.
5274,Howard,Really? Then what were you doing at the comic book store that night?
5275,Penny,Why?
5276,Sheldon,One minute is a long time.
5277,Penny,All right. Look I didn’t know I’m sorry.
5278,Penny,You know I got some candles in my apartment.
5279,Sheldon,Is it about me or the dead pixels?
5280,Leonard,Who else would it be?
5281,Sheldon,After all these years. I’m really happy for the two of you.
5282,Sheldon,What’s he say?
5283,Raj,Wait so Star Wars and Star Trek characters can go on the same branch?
5284,Raj,I should go.
5285,Howard,Okay.
5286,Penny,No.
5287,Raj,Yeah so what?
5288,Howard,It’s a little hard to see with the city lights but that W-shaped constellation is Cassiopeia. And she was the mother of Andromeda who’s over there.
5289,Sheldon,Excuse me Penny but we’re…
5290,Howard,This is the part where you talk.
5291,Penny,You you stupid Pop-Tart.
5292,Leonard,Just hiding some stuff in your closet don’t tell Penny.
5293,Raj,Dude can you even open your mouth without spewing a cultural stereotype?
5294,Sheldon,I have a conclusion based on an observation.
5295,Sheldon,Let’s think out of the box for a moment. How about a molecular sieve?
5296,Howard,Is this what you do when I’m not here make really good points?
5297,Penny,Well he was moping down in the lobby so I invited him over and now I regret it.
5298,Sheldon,You bid $800.
5299,Howard,How are you doing with…
5300,Howard,Any question but that.
5301,Raj,That’s a mirror.
5302,Leonard,Oh you’re good at this.
5303,Leonard,I want to return this Wild West and Witches Ka’a expansion pack.
5304,Leonard,Ah yeah that’s Captain Sweatpants. He doesn’t really help the point I’m trying to make.
5305,Penny,What does that mean?
5306,Penny,No. Come on it’s Sheldon. Nothing is gonna happen.
5307,Sheldon,You guys the bathroom here is amazing. There’s people cooking in it.
5308,Sheldon,I’m not nearly drunk enough. Okay. Do you have any idea what it’s like to see your mother ravaging someone?
5309,Raj,We hide behind the Dumpsters in the parking lot and ambush people when they come to pee.
5310,Sheldon,Well I’m sorry but that is your second strike.
5311,Penny,Look Sheldon all I’m saying is strap on a pair and go talk to Amy.
5312,Leonard,She’s probably heard every possible line Howard. Why don’t you just try hello?
5313,Penny,Oh come on. I’ll be gentle. Let me take your ear virginity.
5314,Penny,Oh absolutely.
5315,Raj,Since when?
5316,Sheldon,Good. And how it relates to the calculus of variations?
5317,Raj,Hey we wrote the Kama Sutra. If it involves butts there’s a word for it.
5318,Penny,Yes.
5319,Leonard,Really? The last green thing I saw you eat was a Skittle.
5320,Raj,Not really.
5321,Penny,Well good.
5322,Leonard,I wonder who’s going to tell his parents they’re not having grandchildren.
5323,Sheldon,Hello fastest man alive. Want to see me read your entire comic book? Want to see it again? Something’s wrong.
5324,Penny,Okay. Good.
5325,Leonard,Oh boy do I?
5326,Howard,God you never listen.
5327,Leonard,I’m sorry you feel that way.
5328,Leonard,Oh too bad. I guess the thing to do now is just pick yourself up dust yourself off forget it and move on.
5329,Leonard,Wait a minute what’s the plan here? Let’s say he meets her and he likes her and they get married what’s he going to do stay drunk for the rest of his life?
5330,Leonard,I think if you’re pulling up your pants you’re not a doorman. 
5331,Leonard,I have to get a lock for my door.
5332,Penny,Yeah kind of but now we can invite our friends and family.
5333,Penny,You hung in there though.
5334,Raj,Don’t try to change me dude. I am what I am.
5335,Raj,I feel you. I’ve been dating multiple women.
5336,Leonard,I don’t know.
5337,Sheldon,What?
5338,Leonard,Then just say go straight.
5339,Penny,See I’m not a scientist like them.
5340,Sheldon,But then Mark Ruffalo was the Hulk in The Avengers and he was even better.
5341,Howard,If you really want to challenge yourself you could learn to speak Hindi.
5342,Leonard,Your friendship means a lot to me as well what else?
5343,Howard,Hello?
5344,Howard,Hey you think it’d be okay if I brought Claire to the wine tasting?
5345,Leonard,Compromise. Watch Babylon 5.
5346,Raj,I don’t know what time their plane gets in but let me let me shoot them a text.
5347,Leonard,No no no come on don’t leave. Just try it.
5348,Raj,Yeah let me start practicing for it. Do you want fries with that Maharaja Mac?”
5349,Howard,Yes I am. The god Kamadeva has shot us with his flowery arrows of love.
5350,Penny,No you’re wrong.
5351,Sheldon,What choice did I have? The mighty Sheldor level 85 blood elf hero of the Eastern kingdoms has been picked clean like a carcass in the desert sun. Plus the FBI hung up on me.
5352,Leonard,You went to President Seibert’s house in the middle of the night?
5353,Sheldon,Yes. Amy are you worried that us living together will take the mystery out of our relationship?
5354,Raj,You have lost so much weight! That must have been difficult for you because you were so so fat! Do you remember?
5355,Sheldon,The exact time machine that carried actor Rod Taylor from Victorian England into the post-apocalyptic future which society had splintered into two factions the sub-terranean Morlocks who survived by feasting on the flesh of the gentle surface dwelling Eloy.
5356,Penny,Listen I don’t want to break up with you.
5358,Raj,Feel better now?
5359,Penny,How am I supposed to plan my bodily functions?
5361,Sheldon,Some will be successful some may be homeless. It’s fun to think about.
5362,Sheldon,I’m glad you think so. That’s what I strive to emulate.
5363,Sheldon,The big deal is I was expecting us to be an intimate group of five. Now we’re going to be a faceless mass of six.
5364,Leonard,Sheldon! How was the comic book store?
5365,Raj,Oh please?
5366,Raj,Are you are you sure? Because this is the part of the night where I’ve said something stupid and the girl usually leaves.
5367,Sheldon,We have to stop at Pottery Barn.
5368,Raj,They know that we’re not exclusive and we just don’t ask too many questions.
5369,Raj,Mm-hmm. How do you sleep in these things? Silk pajamas on satin sheets? I slid out of the bed like three times.
5370,Raj,Okay that I said. But that’s a real problem. You give a girl another woman’s bra and you will not be having sex with her that night. Maybe the other girl but not her.
5371,Leonard,I don’t?
5372,Sheldon,How can she not be sure how she feels? You know when I have a feeling I know it. Trains? Love them. Swordfish? I love them too. They’re fish with a sword for a nose.
5373,Sheldon,She was part of the American team at CERN.
5374,Penny,I’ll risk it.
5375,Sheldon,Did you enjoy my lecture?
5376,Sheldon,Hunger? Indigestion I’m sorry I’m really not very good at this. Anyway Penny now believes that on Friday night we’re going to participate in my cousin Leopold’s drug intervention.
5377,Howard,Sheldon do I really sound like that?
5378,Leonard,Well uh uh what are you doing up?
5379,Raj,Should have put it in the bag first.
5380,Leonard,Like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory. Yep.
5381,Leonard,Because if all guys were like me the human race couldn’t survive.
5382,Leonard,When did we get a wall safe?
5383,Howard,Wow. Looks like the Ganges on laundry day.
5384,Raj,Nice. So mmm. What’s up?
5385,Leonard,Oh really show me where we put a drip tray a sluice and an overflow reservoir?
5386,Leonard,Really?
5387,Leonard,So much.
5388,Raj,You won’t regret it. I’m the most pathetic guy you’ve ever met. And that boys and girls is how it’s done.
5389,Leonard,Not really.
5390,Sheldon,This place is terrific. Why. why have we never been here before?
5391,Sheldon,The more interesting question you should be asking is what does this flower smell like?
5392,Sheldon,Hard as this may be to believe it’s possible that I’m not boyfriend material.
5393,Sheldon,No. I was just tricking you.
5394,Sheldon,You first.
5395,Howard,Whoo-hoo!
5396,Penny,Don’t be proud of that.
5397,Sheldon,Hi Leonard. It’s me Sheldon. In the living room. I just I wanted you to know I saw the tie. Message received. You’re welcome. You carry on. Give my best to Lesley.
5398,Sheldon,Oh very well. I’m no stranger to enjoying the pleasures of solitude. Oh!
5399,Penny,Hmmm. Good for him. Good for Leonard. Okay night.
5401,Sheldon,It’s fascinating. Let me see if I can duplicate the result. Howard I’ve always thought the lemon was an underrated fruit. Care to weigh in?
5402,Leonard,No no don’t tell her.
5403,Sheldon,Thank you.
5404,Raj,It didn’t work for Randy it didn’t work for Tina it sure as hell isn’t gonna work for Jennifer.
5405,Raj,Hey so what did you guys think of the new episode of Caprica last night?
5406,Sheldon,No. The Texas Rangers tracked them down to their village and slaughtered every last one of them. It was a happy ending. Well for my nine-fingered Nana.
5407,Sheldon,Oh this is an unmitigated disaster.
5408,Raj,I’m hammered.
5409,Sheldon,Yes well it’s better than what Wolowitz did. He drew a raccoon with what appears to be a distended scrotum.
5410,Leonard,Maybe something less personal.
5411,Sheldon,It’s a game that I just invented in which the participants answer physics questions in remedial Spanish. Um ¿Dónde está el boson de Higgs?
5412,Howard,No.
5413,Howard,Well he is much more attractive than Leonard.
5414,Sheldon,Morning old chum.
5415,Sheldon,Hurry.
5416,Leonard,Would I be completely out of line to ask you to shoot him?
5417,Raj,Five four three two one. That’s too bad.
5418,Leonard,Not you him.
5419,Leonard,Who are you calling?
5420,Sheldon,I suppose that’s acceptable.
5421,Penny,So what do you want to do?
5422,Leonard,Well it’s gonna take at least an hour to eat and I don’t see a Sheldon-approved restaurant proximate to a Sheldon-approved theatre.
5423,Sheldon,Uh let’s see. 704? No wait it’s on clock. Uh the real answer isn’t much better. 102 degrees.
5424,Sheldon,It’s nothing personal I’d just prefer if my future niece or nephew didn’t become flatulent every time they eat an Eskimo pie.
5425,Sheldon,You look amazing. I mean this resolution is remarkable.
5426,Leonard,That would be great thank you.
5427,Leonard,Yes.
5428,Leonard,Were you seeing other men?
5429,Sheldon,Oh he’s just trying to butter you up. And for the record butter is an excellent lubricant for your rectal exam.
5430,Howard,Well you eloped and we didn’t get a chance to throw you a bachelor party so there’s a van downstairs and we’re here to take you to a surprise location for the weekend.
5431,Sheldon,What happened to the top hats and the corncob pipes?
5432,Sheldon,A summons for what?
5433,Raj,Right now all I can think about is cookies and Hawaiian Punch.
5435,Howard,Hey Leonard did you see my limo downstairs.
5436,Sheldon,Oh sorry. 
5437,Raj,Hey I just found out I have to be at the telescope lab all weekend. Any chance you and Bernadette could take care of my dog?
5438,Penny,It’s hot when Sheldon talks dirty.
5439,Howard,A little one. It’s it’s a farewell for Leonard so all the attention will be on him. If you wear something brown and sit on the couch they won’t even know you’re there.
5440,Howard,Oh why does he need a ladder?
5441,Sheldon,No you’re not. Pay no attention to that man in the bed.
5442,Raj,I don’t understand.
5443,Leonard,Leonard.
5444,Sheldon,Oh I don’t know. I mean statistically speaking I’m sure you have something to worry about.
5445,Raj,Great. They get girlfriends and they just abandon us?
5447,Sheldon,Now before I start I need you to know that I’m very excited about this and anything you say that isn’t enthusiastically supportive will throw our entire relationship into question. So keep an open mind.
5448,Howard,Oh God! Yes we get it. You have a girlfriend now.
5449,Sheldon,Uh mariachi bands wild dogs beans that jump around ’cause there’s a worm inside.
5450,Sheldon,Rats!
5451,Howard,Well I would’ve slept in my own bed but it was being used to bring shame to my family. And the memory of Gene Roddenberry.
5452,Leonard,Rupert Murdoch?
5453,Howard,Okay Leonard here I am at your birthday party I don’t know where you are dude but it’s really kick-ass. Everyone is very very drunk and uh…  Oh look there’s a girl taking her shirt off.
5455,Leonard,Oh.
5456,Howard,Don’t worry. You’re surrounded by your C-Men.
5457,Sheldon, Penny.
5458,Sheldon,Stuart what are you doing here?
5459,Sheldon,Excuse me. I object. You propose a guessing game yet you don’t give me enough time to guess. For the record I was going to say your sister Priya.
5460,Raj,He’s right. Also what kind of name is Biff? Sounds like when you pop open a can of Pillsbury dough. Biff.
5461,Sheldon,You expressed an interest in having people over and I feel I dismissed it too quickly. So I took matters into my own hands and I arranged a brunch.
5462,Leonard,Yeah more cutbacks.
5463,Sheldon,Very well. I’m done talking about it.
5464,Sheldon,Well it’s a game of the imagination Leonard. Paint a picture.
5465,Leonard,You guys all right?
5466,Raj,Nothing I was just hoping for something a little more you know redonkulous.
5467,Sheldon,Good. Little claustrophobic.
5468,Penny,The what?
5469,Sheldon,Fine.  Oh lord. Dr. Koothrappali as your superior I forbid you from writing on my board!
5470,Howard,I’m sorry?
5471,Howard,This is not how I imagined this day going I should be with them right now.
5472,Raj,I skipped spin class for this.
5473,Leonard,It is a little big for the living room isn’t it?
5474,Leonard,Well funny story. So we have plenty of the 60/40 tin-to-lead ratio solder but the spools look a lot like the 63/37 tin-to-lead…
5475,Leonard,You’re saying I couldn’t get laid in a women’s prison with a handful of pardons.
5476,Sheldon,Against my will. In the South pre-adolescent children are forced through a process called cotillion which indoctrinates them with all the social graces and dance skills needed to function in 18th century Vienna.
5477,Howard,That was pretty badass dude.
5478,Leonard,It came from Tiffany’s.
5479,Howard,If she isn’t gonna use it then why are we doing this?
5480,Leonard,Come on he’s not that cute.
5481,Raj,I have a thick accent. You don’t know what I said.
5482,Raj,Hey the jaw wants what it wants.
5483,Raj,She has nothing to do with this. I am my own man.
5484,Penny,Oh that’s great. Let’s open it up and put him in there.
5485,Penny,Hey we’re going to dinner. You want to come?
5486,Leonard,India.
5487,Sheldon,You’re not?
5488,Sheldon,Oh actually I would.
5489,Howard,Can I get anyone anything at all?
5490,Leonard,Thanks for pointing it out.
5491,Penny,What do you think?
5492,Leonard,She lied.
5493,Penny,Yeah well I don’t think we’re gonna get to do that today.
5494,Sheldon,Oh I don’t know about you guys but I have been through the emotional wringer tonight.
5495,Howard,I heard you call her Brown Sugar. In my book that’s defilement.
5496,Sheldon,No I’m just going to tell her I’m coming so she can give that good time Charlie the heave-ho.
5497,Leonard,How was rock climbing?
5498,Sheldon,Oh I’m afraid if we wear the same pocket watch it will be embarrassing.
5499,Sheldon,You can’t be serious. If I wanted to waste my time on nonsense I’d follow Leonard on Instagram.
5500,Sheldon,Because in the last ten minutes Santa came to town kissed Mommy and ran Grandma over with a reindeer. I had a drunk uncle who did all those things. Nobody sings songs about him.
5501,Penny,Oh. Okay great I’m having some furniture delivered tomorrow and I may not be here so….  Oh! Hel…hello!
5502,Howard,Yes.
5504,Howard,You’re lucky. With me it’s usually the other way around.
5505,Leonard,Why is he writing to you?
5506,Leonard,Well I don’t know how you have a relationship without talking.
5507,Leonard,We are communicating through the wall.
5508,Sheldon,What’s a hickey?
5509,Howard,Who wouldn’t? You could zip through a maze in nothing flat squeeze through really small holes and shut down restaurants in a single bound. And the best part is if I were Rat-Man you could be my sidekick Mouse Boy.
5510,Penny,Okay. Raj wait. Thank you for being my friend. 
5511,Penny,Okay sweetie I’ll take care of you what do you need?
5512,Sheldon,Very well. You may celebrate my life by throwing a party with cake presents and a shower of admiration and love. But then you owe me big-time.
5513,Leonard,I think I gave you bad advice about Penny and I want to apologize.
5514,Sheldon,Yes. Do you have something I could use as a cape?
5515,Sheldon,All right invitation pointlessly offered invitation declined as expected everyone’s civil nobody’s fighting. Have a nice evening.
5516,Raj,Yeah me neither.
5517,Leonard,It is. It is about us.
5518,Sheldon,The Conqueror.
5519,Sheldon,Well then you’ll want some manganese.
5520,Leonard,Yeah?
5521,Penny,As he stood for Amelia to dry him…
5522,Leonard,Yup. Got the code.
5523,Penny,How would I know? I’m not even sure I get it.
5524,Sheldon,You and… oh sure and while we’re at it why don’t we get engaged too? Why don’t we get a little house start a family? Enjoy our sunset years together? Do you hear yourself woman?
5525,Sheldon,Brimstone.
5526,Sheldon,Will you all excuse me? Leonard is subtly signalling that he’d like to talk to me in private.
5527,Penny,Apparently the one fella tried to adjust the thermostat then the other fella went bat-crap crazy.
5528,Howard,That had nothing to do with Rachel. It was an overreaction to a bad zipper injury.
5529,Raj,Oh too bad. I’ve always wanted to go to Long Beach.
5530,Sheldon,Well I’m sure he’ll be fine. He has his hammer.
5531,Sheldon,Apologise for what?
5532,Sheldon,Homo Novus doesn’t know.
5533,Leonard,I don’t like it either.
5534,Sheldon,I see what you’re doing. You’re attempting to build on the work of Ebbinghaus by triggering an involuntary memory of me playing that game admittedly the happiest 600 hours of my childhood but it won’t work.
5535,Leonard,Not much. Bro.
5536,Penny,Stop. Okay. They told Mary they were living together there was a fight he got his feelings hurt then he put underwear on his head.
5537,Penny,So this wasn’t the awkward part?
5538,Sheldon,Aaah!
5539,Leonard,I don’t know.
5540,Howard,Oh well her last name is Sweeney and something just didn’t seem right about Koothrapeeney.
5541,Penny,No I really I’m sorry free what? Sorry what what?
5542,Leonard,I’ll set the timer.
5543,Raj,Can I make you breakfast? Admiral Ackbar’s Snack Bar is open for business.
5544,Raj,Yeah me too. We’ve got more important things to do. Who cares what stupid forty-three means?
5545,Leonard,I think you could give a better clue.
5546,Sheldon,We don’t eat here I don’t know what’s good.
5547,Penny,Handicapped people are nice Leonard. Everyone knows that.
5548,Sheldon,Whatever it is we know his life will never be the same.
5549,Penny,Oh God. Probably nothing. I think I saw the director twirling a sign outside the Verizon store.
5550,Penny,Certainly doesn’t feel like it does it?
5551,Sheldon,Yes.
5552,Howard,My father thinks the reason I can’t make a relationship work is because I’m spoiled.
5553,Penny,Hey. What’s going on?
5554,Sheldon,A fitting swan song to your career as a waitress to forget my order one last time.
5555,Leonard,Fourteen fifty but it’s no biggie you’ll get the next one. 
5556,Leonard,It’s not crazy.
5557,Penny,What is that?
5558,Howard,I can’t believe they’re still married. Oh no I forgot Cinnamon’s toothbrush at Howard’s. I guess you’re sharing with Daddy again.
5559,Raj,Well give me a chance you don’t even know me.
5560,Raj,If you ever need somewhere to crash there’s always my place.
5561,Raj,Then spell it.
5562,Sheldon,You realize Penny that the technology that went into this arm will one day make unskilled food servers such as yourself obsolete.
5563,Sheldon,Okay. Just to be on the safe side am I in any danger of getting juggler’s elbow?
5564,Sheldon,It’s Morse code.
5565,Leonard,Because he’s hitting on you?
5566,Leonard,Okay well yeah come on up. So how’d you two guys meet?
5567,Sheldon,Well it’s not just doing simple cognitive tasks. You need to push your brain out of its comfort zone and reach mental exhaustion.
5568,Leonard,I said I’m sorry.
5569,Sheldon,Good news Raj. I got the blood work back from the lab. You’re okay to stay for a while.
5570,Leonard,Why would you do that?
5571,Leonard,What?
5572,Penny,Oh no no you see in the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator so that he’s warm yet not so close that he sweats. In the summer it’s directly in the path of a cross-breeze created by opening windows there and there. It faces the television at an angle that isn’t direct so he can still talk to everybody yet not so wide that the picture looks distorted.
5573,Leonard,No it’s Steel Magnolias 2 Even Steelier.
5574,Sheldon,Leonard who’s really in charge? The person in charge or those who put him in charge?
5575,Leonard,Oh yeah.
5576,Sheldon,Coming! . Greetings friends.
5577,Howard,How dare you. Aishwarya Rai is a Goddess. By comparison Madhuri Dixit is a leprous prostitute.
5578,Leonard,Three two.
5579,Penny,So Bernadette how goes the hunt for bridesmaid dresses?
5580,Howard,Yeah take advantage of that window of opportunity before it slams shut on your little dinky.
5581,Sheldon,20 seconds.
5582,Penny,No no I was just giving you a compliment.
5583,Penny,You’re making it a big deal.
5584,Howard,I’m in.
5585,Sheldon,Ten seconds ago you never heard of him. Now you’re an expert.
5586,Howard,I’m the new Homo in town. That came out wrong.
5587,Penny,You know what? I could use a drink. Do you want to stop for a drink?
5588,Sheldon,I’m measuring residual heat levels on the playing cards to determine which one’s been touched. By the way if you hope to have children I suggest you switch from briefs to boxers. Your testicles look a tad warm.
5589,Leonard,That stinks. How long are you out of the apartment?
5590,Sheldon,Leonard prepare to be humbled and weep at the glory of my genius.
5591,Sheldon,Well the status is as it always was. She’s a girl. She’s a friend. She is not my please forgive me for doing this girlfriend.
5592,Penny,I just meant a question about the drug.
5593,Leonard,I’m thinking you need a testosterone patch. Penny and I just want to do something low-key. You know cocktails light jazz music hors d’oeuvres.
5594,Leonard,Actually he’s pretty cool. I mean not only is he a brilliant scientist but it turns out he’s a Black Diamond skier he collects vintage motorcycles he plays in a rock band.
5595,Penny,Well yeah he’s my boyfriend. Isn’t that like his job?
5596,Sheldon,Did he mean as if she’d been out in the sun tending an herb garden without wearing a hat or sunblock?
5597,Penny,Yeah. It’s cleaner than my couch. Found half a Hot Pocket in there.
5598,Howard,Good good. Oh boy help me out here. Does she want me to kiss her or not?
5599,Sheldon,Who’s Adam West? Leonard what do the two of you talk about after the coitus?
5600,Penny,Okay this is ridiculous.  Sheldon? Can I come in?
5601,Penny,All right how are we gonna play this when they return?
5602,Sheldon,And don’t forget to Skype me when you arrive.
5603,Penny,Oh please how could I possibly devastate Howard?
5604,Sheldon,She returned to her apartment. I presume to shower and vomit. Not necessarily in that order.
5605,Penny,Oh my God. We’ve done things on that couch.
5606,Sheldon,Amy come back. I don’t know how to open the oysters.
5607,Sheldon,But Meemaw just made cookies.
5608,Sheldon,I suppose. What happened to me Amy? Years ago I was completely disengaged from my feelings. I’d say it was a happier time but I was disengaged from my feelings so who can tell?
5609,Howard,How could you do that to me? You know I’ve been working it with Alex for weeks.
5610,Howard,Oh you have to be down there for 12 hours at a time.
5611,Leonard,Not heavy ones.
5612,Leonard,The two aren’t mutually exclusive!
5613,Penny,See? I wish I had some of that fire in my life. I mean I want to care about things and get excited like you guys.
5614,Howard,It’s a great deal. We both get our parents off our backs. I don’t have to come home to an empty apartment every night plus once I’m married I can finally eat carbs again and let myself go.
5615,Penny,Thank you.
5616,Leonard,What about it?
5617,Penny,Amy what about you? What do you think you’d be doing if you never met Sheldon?
5618,Penny,Get rid of her how?
5620,Raj,And judging by her lack of Adam’s apple she’s been female her entire life. I like that in a woman.
5621,Leonard,I’ve got what my father used to call furniture disease. My chest is falling into my drawers. I’m not uh familiar with this model. How do I make it start?
5622,Raj,World’s Greatest Astrophysicist?
5623,Penny,Got it. Hey who’s the murderer?
5624,Sheldon,I told you you weren’t smart enough to take it.
5625,Sheldon,That’s not exactly a mutation that would get you into Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngsters but go on. Leonard?
5626,Raj,Sorry. Walking tree.
5627,Leonard,You’re right. I mean he decides what TV shows we watch what food we eat who my favourite hobbit is. I wanted Frodo but we can’t both have Frodo so guess who’s stuck with Samwise Gamgee.
5628,Raj,Come on dude. This is my sister you’re talking about.
5629,Howard,Hello Sheldon.
5630,Raj,No. I got them all cut.
5631,Howard,Mine says To Raj from Stan Lee.
5632,Sheldon,Amy is free. She had a harp lesson on Saturday but it got cancelled. Boy when you take an interest in people you really uncork a geyser of nonsense.
5633,Leonard,Look Howard if I were to ask Lesley Winkle out it would just be for dinner I’m not going to walk into the lab ask her to strip naked and dance for me.
5634,Sheldon,More? I mean look at us. It’s only been three years here we are in bed together.
5635,Penny,All right. Come on. What is really going on with you?
5636,Howard,See you. No wait take her number. I don’t want the temptation.
5638,Raj,So what’s up?
5639,Penny,Well he’s definitely not gay.
5640,Leonard,Howard this is big science. You could be the engineer who builds the equipment that puts us on the cover of magazines.
5641,Leonard,Actually your name is on the electric bill.
5642,Penny,Because last month I sent the electric company a Starbucks gift card an apology note and a few snapshots of me in a bra.
5643,Sheldon,That’s it? Good”
5644,Leonard,Hey if you wait for us to set up the time machine I can drop you off at work yesterday. Time travel joke it’s not… never mind.
5645,Leonard,Okay I’ll sign it!
5646,Sheldon,We just leave the house on Friday night and we return in the wee hours emotionally wrung out from the work of convincing Leo to go back into rehab.
5647,Sheldon,Right this way Uncle Harvey.
5649,Leonard,What did you mean when you said you’re going to miss me?
5650,Sheldon,Leonard the TV is in the building we’ve been denied access to the building ergo we are done.
5651,Penny,Your dresser? Who is this?
5652,Leonard,I don’t know that I’d call myself an infection.
5653,Raj,So your father-in-law is in there right now?
5654,Sheldon,You were lucky. When I was a kid if I wanted an EEG I had to attach my own electrodes.
5655,Sheldon,Oh ow blueberry in my nose blueberry in my nose!
5656,Raj,Interesting. That might explain my weepy days in the middle of the month. You know what I’m talking about.
5657,Sheldon,Ta-da!
5658,Penny,I know. What are the odds?
5659,Raj,Hello?
5660,Leonard,You went out and bought linen?
5661,Raj,You want to go shopping?
5662,Raj,What kind of idiot throws away a terrific chair like this?
5663,Leonard,Well then what do you want us to do?
5664,Leonard,What are you doing here?
5665,Sheldon,Thanks shortyI’ll take it from here. All right you people ready to have some fun? You have a basic understanding of differential calculus and at least one year of algebraic topology? Well then here come the jokes. Why did the chicken cross the Mobius strip? To get to the same side bazinga! All right a neutron walks into a bar and asks how much for a drink? The bartender says for you no charge. Hello? I know you’re out there. I can hear you metabolizing oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide. Looks like we have some academic dignitaries in the audience. Dr. Randall from the geology department only man who’s happy when they take his work for granite. Ba-da cha! I kid the geologists of course but it’s only ’cause I have no respect for the field. Let’s get serious for a moment. Why are we all here? ‘Cause we’re scientists. And what do scientists study? The universe. And what’s the universe made of? I am so glad you asked.  There’s antimony arsenic aluminium selenium and hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen and rhenium and nickel neodymium
5666,Leonard,That’s my girl.
5667,Leonard,He’s probably busy. You’re worried about nothing. Give it a couple more days. I’m sure he’ll play and you’ll see that everything’s fine. My turn. I can’t let Penny hand in a bad paper but how do I tell her it’s bad without letting her know that I read it?
5668,Leonard,It’s not a moth.
5669,Penny,Well just smile and think about koalas.
5670,Leonard,Oh my God Stuart?
5671,Sheldon,I wonder why it was this particular song that was stuck in my head.
5672,Leonard,Yeah.
5673,Leonard,Whoa!
5674,Sheldon,No not at all. No I’m fine. You know Amy had reservations about our relationship so all worked out for the best.
5675,Raj,That’s ’cause you always fill up on chips.
5676,Howard,Plane tickets? Yeah.
5677,Leonard,Yeah. So Bernadette tells me she knows you from self-defence classes?
5678,Sheldon,Well what if I spill tomato soup on my shirt and have to come home to change only to find there’s no water for an enzyme soak.
5679,Howard,Oh come on we just need to be more creative. What if you didn’t step on the floor at all? Like what if you swung on a rope from the ceiling?
5680,Raj,Where are your tools?
5681,Penny,All right. Can you please just go and we’ll talk about this tomorrow?
5682,Sheldon,Is she a geologist?
5683,Howard,Try to keep up Howard I’m killing it.
5684,Sheldon,I don’t see why I’m the one being persecuted here. Dr. Hofstadter he was bragging about his sexual desirability to anyone who would listen. You know and Howard Wolowitz he spent two years using university resources building a six-breasted sex robot. Oh and at the office Christmas party I heard Rajesh Koothrappali refer to you several times as Brown Sugar.
5685,Penny,So did you get a chance to go over the scene I gave you?
5686,Leonard,And why is that?
5687,Sheldon,What’s 16 times 14?
5688,Sheldon,You once had Leonard and me get your television from your ex-boyfriend.
5689,Howard,What?
5690,Leonard,But it would make the present so much nicer.
5691,Sheldon,All right.
5692,Sheldon,I just found out that you recommended myself Dr. Hofstadter and Dr. Koothrappali to be on the short list for tenure.
5693,Howard,Oh beef I’m going to miss you so much. Do you know at the Mumbai McDonald’s you can’t get a Big Mac? All you can get is a Chicken Maharaja Mac. And the special sauce curry which in India
5694,Leonard,You know what I am sick of the roommate agreement. It’s ridiculous. I’m your roommate not your chauffeur. You know I had better things to do yesterday than drive you all the way to the good model train store in Garden Grove because the one in Pasadena has gotten too big for its britches.
5695,Sheldon,To what?
5696,Sheldon,Howard could you lower the lights? I have a short PowerPoint presentation.
5697,Howard,Good good.
5698,Howard,When did he leave?
5699,Sheldon,Oh please everyone knows what’s going to happen. But I see your point.
5700,Howard,Yeah Penny packed you a bag.
5701,Sheldon,Yes?
5702,Raj,You could play Ping-Pong for it.
5703,Leonard,Listen we can do the experiment as planned and beat the Swedish team to the punch or we can kiss our dreams good-bye because we were to afraid to break a few rules.
5704,Leonard,Great. What did you do?
5705,Sheldon,If you intend to pursue Amy you leave me with no choice but to put a stop to it.
5706,Leonard,Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.
5707,Raj,You’re in a Beatles cover band and you need Howard to replace your dad as Ringo.
5708,Penny,She agreed to go out with you for free. What more do you need?
5709,Sheldon,Hmm I see.
5710,Penny,No!
5711,Penny,Damn you’re sneaky.
5712,Raj,Wouldn’t you feel better about yourself if you were more independent?
5713,Leonard,Heartrate pheromones etc yes.
5714,Penny,Okay nice and cosy okay I’ll see you later.
5715,Penny,Mwah!
5716,Raj,You’re such a child.
5717,Penny,No kidding. Two?
5718,Penny,It’s not a big deal I was making coffee and I ran out of milk.
5719,Penny,You’re right we can’t.
5720,Raj,Uh no water’s fine. Anyhow I’ve been thinking about it a lot and and I totally see why Lucy did what she did. I pushed too hard. But you know what? If I back off and give her enough space maybe there’s still a future for us. Yeah the funny thing about life is that you know sometimes…
5721,Raj,End things? I’m trying to tell you that I love you.
5722,Penny,Well then have the robot go and get him.
5723,Leonard,What are you doing here?
5725,Leonard,Public restroom kit. Everything a boy needs for making pee pee in new and strange places.
5726,Howard,Wild Bill Witchcock.
5727,Sheldon,Okay well since I’m obviously being ignored here let’s go over the morning schedule I use the bathroom from 7 to 720 plan your ablutions and bodily functions accordingly.
5728,Leonard,Yes.
5729,Sheldon,Carlsbad is only a couple of hours away.
5730,Sheldon,So you betrayed me?
5731,Howard,You fail to take into account that even mute I am foreign and exotic while you on the other hand are frail and pasty.
5732,Leonard,Hey Sheldon let’s go mock the people buying homeopathic medicine you love that.
5734,Leonard,Weird.
5735,Leonard,Oh right sure. I wish you could stay in LA a while longer.
5736,Penny,I think it’s so adorable you’re making Sheldon breakfast.
5737,Sheldon,I told you to use the walkie-talkie!
5738,Raj,Interesting. Are you a Droid?
5739,Leonard,There you go.
5740,Sheldon,The math would suggest that in a few I’m a clown made of candy. But I don’t dance.
5741,Sheldon,Shhh!
5742,Raj,And that bright little star peeking her head out early today that’s Venus.
5743,Penny,It’s always nice chatting with you Sheldon.
5744,Raj,I’ve never been to Palm Springs.
5745,Howard,No you have to put this back together right now so I can return it.
5746,Leonard,Hey where’d you go?
5747,Sheldon,I was 13 years old and on spring break from college.
5748,Leonard,Fine but set them to stun. If we vaporize Penny I’ll never find a girlfriend that pretty again.
5749,Leonard,It’s fine it’s fine. Go back to sleep.
5750,Sheldon,But tonight’s Thursday. On Thursdays everybody comes over here and has pizza. Or a reasonable facsimile prepared by someone claiming to be Luigi but who sounds suspiciously like Jackie Chan.
5751,Penny,Uh Bernadette’s nickname for you is the virgin piña colada.
5752,Leonard,Holy crap. Someone just ordered a thousand Penny Blossoms.
5753,Howard,I’m so sorry but how can you not like that movie?
5754,Howard,Okay so what it sounds like is what we want is a device that can deliver a message through not only sight but other senses as well.
5755,Sheldon,That doesn’t sound terrifying.
5756,Sheldon,He’s evil. He plays evil mind games. Did he tell you his grandmother died?
5757,Leonard,So I’m just supposed to be okay with you hogging all the credit?
5758,Sheldon,Why?
5759,Raj,He’s right. Let’s make fun of his mother. Howard come rub my feet! My corns are killing me!
5760,Penny,Okay help me out here. How does an archaeology professor get that good with a whip?
5761,Sheldon,When did we get to the Cheesecake Factory?
5762,Leonard,Her feelings got hurt because you guys went dress shopping without her.
5763,Leonard,How does that involve air travel?
5764,Leonard,Really ‘cos you don’t look like you’re swelling up at all maybe we should just pick up some benedryl at the drug store and go home.
5765,Leonard,That’s absurd.
5766,Penny,You know what? That would make me feel better. Thank you.
5767,Howard,Come on Sheldon!
5768,Sheldon,So my mother thought I was incapable of finding a mate and my mate thinks I’m incapable of running my own life.
5769,Leonard,Thank you.
5770,Sheldon,Uh yes I’m aware. But if I say I want to touch one of my friends I’ll get called into Human Resources.
5771,Sheldon,Oh please. Any contract I sign is enforced by my own personal code of ethics.
5772,Leonard,Oh my God what did you do?
5773,Penny,Yeah we swung by her apartment on the way to the restaurant and they’re gonna be fixing it for a while.
5774,Leonard,He handed you the box directly and called you Stretch.
5775,Leonard,You really should.
5776,Sheldon,Oh the fun doesn’t stop. You’re still going home with a goodie bag full of toast.
5777,Sheldon,No? But we’re friends!
5778,Sheldon,Yeah you know how it works. Once a quarter keep our readiness up. Now rise and shine sleepy head. Half the town is probably dead.
5779,Penny,Okay well you know it’s just me. I’m still getting over this break-up with Kurt and this thing with Doug would be just rebound sex.
5780,Leonard,Thank you.
5781,Leonard,I know exactly what we are gonna do.
5782,Howard,Mine just took me to his gynecology office. I got so bored I’d put vaginal lubricant on the bottom of my shoes and pretend I was ice-skating.
5783,Raj,But if we were part of the team that confirmed string theory we could drink for free in any bar in any college town with a university that has a strong science program.
5784,Leonard,Just keep walking. 
5785,Raj,Oh well then I can actually feel the moisture going into my skin.
5786,Raj,Are you going to let me tell the story or not?
5787,Leonard,Yep it is.
5788,Sheldon,Hello 2003.
5789,Sheldon,Your argument is lacking in all scientific merit. It is well established Superman cleans his uniform by flying into Earth’s yellow sun which incinerates any contaminate matter and leaves the invulnerable Kryptonian fabric unharmed and daisy fresh.
5790,Leonard,Swell. I need a drink. Do we have any alcohol?
5791,Howard,Listen dude it’s time for you to hit the road.
5792,Leonard,What? Why didn’t you say that first?
5793,Penny,Okay Howard’s mother is in like every one of your wedding photos.
5794,Penny,I swear to God I am done with guys like that. You know macho with the perfect body and the hair and the money.
5795,Howard,Do him first.
5796,Leonard,What’s that supposed to mean?
5797,Howard,We might as well go ahead and eat. She’s not coming back anytime soon.
5799,Sheldon,I don’t understand why you’re mad at me. You should be mad at Amy. Like I was this afternoon. Hey look at that I let it go.
5800,Penny,How about we just have a little quiet time now?
5801,Penny,No it won’t. Um how does he know I jog?
5802,Penny,Mmm.
5803,Raj,Oh I totally am. If it wasn’t for this beer I couldn’t even talk to you right now. I’m a wreck. There are many things seriously wrong with me. And not quirks either. Like diagnosable psychological problems. Maybe brain damage.
5804,Leonard,Good luck catching a man with that attitude.
5805,Leonard,He’s okay?
5806,Sheldon, Penny.
5807,Penny,Aw.
5808,Sheldon,I told you we shouldn’t go shopping at night.
5809,Sheldon,Can you sing “Soft Kitty”.
5810,Howard,One Ring to find them.
5811,Penny,Yeah I think so.
5812,Penny,I know.
5813,Raj,We’re going to be fine.
5814,Penny,Guess who?
5815,Penny,Okay you’ve got my number now give me the picture.
5816,Sheldon,You should point out the hypocrisy of that.
5817,Sheldon,Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper and welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Over the next 52 weeks you and I are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology.
5818,Sheldon,Oh you shouldn’t have.
5819,Leonard,Wait Alex. Do you want to join us?
5820,Howard,Why do you care so much? You’re dating my sister and Penny and I are in love.
5821,Howard,Goth food.
5822,Leonard,Well unless he’s makes one out of wood like Gepetto I don’t think it’s gonna happen.
5823,Raj,I love kids how old is he?
5824,Penny,Ah there’s definitely some oak.
5825,Sheldon,I’m not going to say I told you so but we could have killed him.
5826,Sheldon,Because it’s working. In the past few weeks unburdened by trivial decisions I’ve co-authored two papers in notable peer-reviewed journals and I’m close to figuring out why the Large Hadron Collider has yet to isolate the Higgs boson particle.
5827,Sheldon,Do you have the enchanted sword?
5828,Howard,Whatever.
5829,Leonard,Howard sit down.
5830,Howard,Dude why don’t you just invoke your girlfriend pact with Wolowitz?
5831,Howard,Hey. Where are the guys?
5832,Sheldon,Well that was a long bus ride for not very much.
5833,Sheldon, Penny?
5834,Raj,Oh please we all know I’m the friend you call when you have no other options. If we were the Justice League I’d be Aquaman.
5835,Sheldon,I think what really needs to be rescued is your sense of whimsy but one quest at a time. So what’s the plan?
5836,Penny,Oh come on. They’re playing one across the hall we should too. Okay we are gonna take turns bouncing a quarter off the table and if it goes into this cup the other person has to drink. Then you get to go again…
5837,Penny,Good night.
5838,Penny,Oh I pack light. Once I got through an entire spring break with nothing but a long T-shirt and a belt.
5839,Sheldon,It’s not a basket. It’s a soldier’s helmet from 16th century China.
5840,Leonard,You don’t have to. Ever.
5841,Penny,Uh denial. See sweetie the list goes on and on.
5842,Leonard,Well?
5843,Leonard,Seriously?
5844,Sheldon,I can’t wear different pyjamas these are my Monday pyjamas. Penny people cannot be in my bedroom.
5845,Leonard,Fine.
5846,Raj,जो भी तुम्हारे नाव मंगाई. That’s Hindi for whatever floats your boat. Uh listen I got a text from that girl Abby and she and her friend Martha want to hang out with us again. What do you say?
5847,Raj,Moo-stache.
5848,Leonard,Hey. Penny don’t get upset. Here. I love you but no I will not marry you.
5849,Leonard,So some alien kid spent his money on the asthma-and-glasses upgrade for me?
5850,Howard,Okay let me have it. Let’s hear all the Raj is a girl jokes.
5851,Sheldon,Not there. That’s my spot.
5852,Leonard,These things happen all the time Sheldon.
5853,Sheldon,He rejected train day.
5854,Leonard,They bought it.
5855,Penny,All right how much exactly does he pay for?
5856,Leonard,Maybe I could go in a little late.
5857,Raj,Oh an exotic little treat. I was just talking to Siri about Peking duck and she said she knew about four Chinese grocers two of which were fairly close to me. Her spontaneity is contagious.
5858,Penny,Well ladies we killed the bottle.
5859,Penny,Oh yeah be careful.
5860,Raj,Okay we’ll call that plan B.
5861,Penny,Don’t be like that.
5862,Penny,Do I? Listen to me. I need to do this on my own. If I fail I fail. If I pass I pass. Do you get it?
5863,Penny,Gosh Raj do you think you’ll ever be able to talk in front of me without being drunk?  Okay well I’ll just um go eat by myself.
5864,Sheldon,And that’s how it’s done.
5865,Leonard,You know when they were escorting us to the detaining room I looked through a door and I’m pretty sure I saw a display case with the Ark of the Covenant.
5866,Leonard,Hey. Uh what did Sheldon say to you?
5867,Leonard,So what? It’s the same food.
5868,Leonard,Howard just come in here.
5869,Penny,So you gonna get up there later?
5870,Howard,Don’t try to change me dude. I am what I am.
5871,Leonard,You know it’s nice to spend time with people who don’t talk about work like it’s some kind of soap opera.
5872,Penny,So either one of you weirdos want to buy my underwear? Only fourteen hundred bucks.
5873,Raj,That’s sweet of you. But what can you do to help?
5874,Sheldon,What should I tell her.
5875,Raj,I’ll tell you one thing. If I get rich enough that’s the kind of girl I want to take on a submarine ride. And yes that time I meant it to be dirty.
5877,Sheldon,Oh half and half instead of whole milk?
5878,Sheldon,Why are you here?
5879,Sheldon,What about the roommate agreement? It specifically states that any changes in furnishing have to be approved by the Furnishing Committee. Which only sits on alternate years. Yeah and by the way it sits over there.
5880,Leonard,Oh we really need to get you a girl.
5881,Leonard,What do you want from me? I just don’t give a rat’s ass.
5882,Sheldon,Here you go Doctor. Red Zinger with one teaspoon of honey.
5883,Raj,Bye. All right. So uh we’re meeting for coffee like two adults. Everybody’s happy. Easy peasy.
5884,Leonard,I mean she’s really beautiful. She could have any guy she wants. Which is probably why it took her so many years to tell me she loved me.
5885,Howard,Boy I bet Ellen Pages friends aren’t giving her this kind of crap.
5886,Penny,It’s only logical.
5888,Penny,Okay let me check.
5889,Leonard,Yeah but she also used to sleep with Zack.
5890,Howard,It’s different. You’re people don’t worship lox.
5891,Penny,That’s exactly what I thought. Thank you for listening. You’re a doll. 
5892,Howard,Yeah well sometimes your jokes hurt.
5893,Howard,I don’t appreciate your sarcasm but we’ve still got two blocks to go so I’ll put up with it.
5894,Sheldon,Meh.
5895,Sheldon,Ah gentlemen what is on the conversational menu this morning?
5896,Sheldon,I can make it but I won’t.
5897,Raj,Well then what are we going to do tonight?
5898,Leonard,This game’s dangerous. I could get you in trouble.
5899,Raj,Not to mention Malibu Koothrappali and his totally bitchin’ dream house.
5900,Penny,Look sweetie this is a natural thing to feel okay? But just because good things are happening to Leonard doesn’t take anything away from you. You know what? Let me tell you a little story. Once there was a girl who worked at the Cheesecake Factory and she wasn’t very good at her job.
5901,Leonard,Or if we ended up making money from this Sheldon and I could split our shares with you.
5902,Leonard,And we live with Sheldon so the word inconvenience has really lost all meaning.
5903,Penny,Sheldon aren’t you gonna spend a little time with Amy?
5904,Leonard,Do you mean?
5905,Penny,What?
5906,Leonard,Sure
5907,Howard,Good timing. Dinner’s almost ready.
5908,Leonard,Oh. Sure. Absolutely.
5909,Sheldon,Excellent yeah. That was a ruse. They’re not the best. Physics is the best. And by the way coffee was also an unacceptable choice. All right so I see here you’re from Des Moines Iowa. Uh you’re summa cum laude in theoretical physics from Stanford University. Oh and two years ago you had a persistent ear infection. I hope that didn’t cause any hearing loss.
5910,Sheldon,There’s no way.
5911,Leonard,You don’t think you’ll be bored?
5912,Leonard,It might’ve been the worst one we’ve ever had.
5913,Sheldon,Do you want to say it?
5914,Sheldon,Oh. I guess I’m a special boy. You know sometimes when a boy is special he gets a Fudgsicle. Which by the way tastes like the speed of light.
5915,Sheldon,You’re not listening to my side of it.
5916,Raj,Isn’t there a university policy against dating graduate students?
5917,Sheldon,Oh that certainly would suck.
5918,Leonard,Okay I hate to break this to you and whatever your jammy is but I’m pretty sure she is a prostitute.
5919,Howard,Yeah sure.
5921,Penny,Thank you. Hey maybe the answer to your career question is in one of these.
5922,Sheldon,Top of the afternoon gentlemen.
5923,Penny,That’s the thing I’m not. I’m not unhappy at all. It’s just I don’t know I I’ve been in love before but it felt different. But maybe this is a new better boring kind of love. Do you ever feel that way about Howard?
5924,Penny,I’m sorry Stuart. Thanks anyway.
5925,Penny,Wow you popular girls are mean.
5926,Penny,Well no but when I was a senior in high school one of my friends heard I was going to be named head cheerleader. Oh I was so excited. My mom even made me a celebration pie. Then they named stupid Valerie Mossbacher head cheerleader. Big ol’ slutbag.
5927,Penny,Oh he does. He so does. What should he do?
5928,Sheldon,I don’t know. Hey look a quarter.
5929,Sheldon,I’m constitutionally incapable. That’s why I was refused clearance for a very prestigious government research fellowship at a secret military supercollider located beneath a fake agricultural station 12.5 miles south east of Travers City Michigan. Which you did not hear about from me.
5930,Penny,Of course not. If I became a famous actress and had to move you would just come with me.
5931,Penny,Oh I forgot to tell you we’re gonna meet up with Bernadette to spy on Amy and her date.
5932,Sheldon,Is the sex starting now?
5933,Penny,Honey do you want some coffee?
5934,Leonard,So what’s going on?
5935,Penny,Okay calm down no-one can make you get married. Why don’t you just meet this girl and see what happens.
5936,Leonard,What do you think about it Sheldon?
5937,Leonard,Coffee maker?
5938,Raj,Dude.
5939,Sheldon,I’m on vacation. Social convention dictates that I let my hair down at a local watering hole. Social convention is stupid.
5940,Leonard,I’m thinking!
5942,Raj,That’s a cute age. They can do so many things.
5943,Sheldon,No. Amy?
5944,Sheldon,They didn’t used to be. You and Leonard and Penny you all poisoned me with emotions. I was like the Tin Man perfectly content until that evil wizard gave him a heart.
5945,Sheldon,Very well. Enjoy yourself. You’re going to be in the presence of something that I’ve dreamed of seeing for decades. I just hope you’ll be able to appreciate the magnitude of where you are and what it represents.
5946,Sheldon,I gargled with tequila and may have swallowed a teeny bit.
5947,Raj,We only had four servants. And two of them were children.
5948,Raj,Please Bernadette. Let me leave with my dignity.
5949,Leonard,Oh I’m so glad you asked it like that. You.
5950,Sheldon,You know riding with Leonard has gotten a little tedious lately. The only car game he ever wants to play is the Quiet Game. And he’s terrible at it I always win.
5951,Sheldon,I’m calling it. I won.
5953,Sheldon,Oh where to begin? Trees indoors. Overuse of the words ’tis and ’twas. And the absurd custom of one stocking. Everyone knows socks belong in pairs. Who uses one sock?
5954,Raj,Are you impressed by that?
5955,Leonard,No he doesn’t.
5956,Raj,Oh dude I wish you had said something before I pounded that last Red Bull.
5957,Sheldon,The big deal is that nobody touches food on my plate.
5958,Sheldon,You can’t quit. That’s a court-martial offence. That’s punishable by… You can’t quit.
5959,Penny,Oh voodoo’s real. You don’t want to mess with voodoo.
5960,Leonard,Okay that is the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.
5961,Penny,Do you think I have what it takes to really make it as an actress?
5962,Leonard,Oh hey. I just heard back from the liquid helium guy.
5963,Sheldon,I sense that’s not sincere although I have no idea why.
5964,Leonard,Or dinner. I was thinking six thirty if you can go or a different time.
5965,Sheldon,Boy do I love restrictions.
5966,Penny,You know Klingon.
5967,Sheldon,Leonard is upstairs right now with my arch enemy.
5968,Leonard,So what do you need us for?
5969,Leonard,Yes.
5970,Sheldon,You mean just go someplace else and be… someplace else?
5971,Howard,Their meatballs are pretty good.
5972,Leonard,Ugh don’t get me started on rebound sex.
5973,Penny,Oh now I’m with ya. Okay.
5974,Sheldon,Too slow?
5975,Penny,No danger look it’s just me Penny look I got to level 25 and reached Purple Lotus Swamp right?
5976,Sheldon,It’s asymptotically free partons inside a quark-gluon plasma.
5977,Sheldon,Wolowitz has informed me of your grand deception. Do you have anything to say for yourself?
5978,Raj,Thank you. Not just for being upset but for believing that could happen.
5979,Sheldon,Absolutely not.
5980,Howard,I think she’s smoking hot.
5981,Raj,I really thought she would say it.
5982,Leonard,Wake up wake up wake up.
5983,Howard,That’s cruel. You know it goes straight to my hips.
5984,Leonard,Can I control the thermostat?
5985,Sheldon,Come on.
5986,Leonard,How come you’re not doing a mission? You’re just wandering around.
5987,Raj,Uh go ahead. Read it.
5988,Penny,Hu.. what?
5989,Howard,And he’s all like aren’t you the guys from Footprints on the Moo-oo-ooh what is he doing?!
5990,Penny,You know I don’t even know what the point of me staying in L.A. is. I haven’t gotten a single acting job since I moved out here. The closest I came was last month I got a callback for a hemorrhoid commercial.
5991,Penny,All right fine. Well Sheldon I’m no expert but aren’t you completely missing the point of Spock? I mean he liked to act like he had no emotions but he was still half human.
5992,Sheldon,I knew it. Give us the precious!
5993,Howard,I broke up with her.
5994,Penny,You saying I don’t have an open mind?
5995,Howard,No. See what I did there? I turned it around.
5996,Leonard,Hey.
5997,Penny,Well she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my brother so she’s kind of family.
5998,Raj,Oh come on you know you want to say it. Say it. Say you love him. Say it!
5999,Leonard,Look you can spend the rest of the day being bitter about this.
6000,Howard,Uh this is my friend Sheldon. Sheldon this is Emily.
6001,Sheldon,I’m sorry. We just need a word.
6002,Howard,Actually I was thinking Leonard.
6003,Penny,Oh you wanted me to pay.
6004,Leonard,Move out.
6005,Sheldon,Hang on a moment.  Here. Take some. Pay me back when you can.
6006,Sheldon,Great. Kick him out. Break his heart. Everybody wins.
6007,Penny,It’s just a bunch of pants.
6008,Sheldon,Other than my mother my sister and my mee-maw no. But in the interest of full disclosure I was once on a bus and had to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to an elderly nun who passed out from heat exhaustion. Every year I get a Christmas card from her signed with far too many X’s and O’s.
6009,Leonard,Yeah I’m glad.
6010,Leonard,Sheldon the food’s here.
6011,Sheldon,Well there’s nothing embarrassing about that your father worked with Lewis Leakey a great anthropologist. It had nothing to do with your bed-wetting.
6012,Sheldon,Is Penny crying?
6013,Howard,But Papa I’m not supposed…
6015,Sheldon,Hey would you like to hear some songs I’ve rewritten to get children interested in the hard sciences?
6016,Sheldon,You’re so close.
6017,Raj,Let’s see. Uh his name is Trent Monaco.
6018,Leonard,It’s not a big deal.
6019,Howard,I’d like to think the Four on Your Side guy cares about me.
6020,Penny,Alright alright how do I get the sword?
6021,Sheldon,Well you’ve become such an integral part of my life as well as this show I felt it only right to include your name in the title.
6022,Penny,Hi?
6023,Howard,We have 128 assorted Penny Blossoms ready to ship.
6024,Howard,Don’t you mean the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Distribution System?
6025,Leonard,So how’s work?
6026,Howard,Well I try to. I certainly wouldn’t be a scientist if you hadn’t been my role model.  Who wants to go to Vegas in a real helicopter?
6027,Penny,Okay it’s just a notebook what’s the big deal?
6028,Sheldon,Elizabeth’s my friend and you’re playing with her!
6029,Sheldon,It’s a questionnaire I devised. I’m having some difficulty bonding with a colleague at work so I’m doing a little research to better understand why my current friends like me.
6030,Sheldon,Well I guess those chaps will have to have someone else buy their girlfriends presents. Now here is let’s see this is this is about two thousand dollars um I think she likes monkeys and the colour grey. Contribute to my work. Ah kids say the darnedest things.
6031,Penny,Thanks. I was scrambling.
6033,Penny,I’ll pay a thousand dollars to watch you cut footloose.
6034,Sheldon,For the record giant rats are possible.
6035,Raj,Oh I see you’re reading Saga.
6036,Leonard,Okay let’s talk about that.
6037,Sheldon,Amy pointed out that between the two of us our genetic material has the potential of producing the first in a line of intellectually superior benign overlords to guide humanity to a brighter tomorrow.
6038,Leonard,No no no would it help if I told you that I offered her my heart and she kind of stomped on it.
6039,Raj,A Milk Dud?
6040,Sheldon,And then Leonard took me to the barber and the dentist and then to cap off the perfect day the Los Angeles Bureau of Weights and Measures.
6041,Penny,Okay. Here goes.
6042,Penny,Okay look I bought the game and I’ve been exploring the Island of Tordage but I can’t figure out how to get past the guard captain.
6043,Penny,Oh. Sorry. I don’t know your sad song.
6044,Leonard,Seriously? You have nothing better to do than sit around and discuss the possibility of giant ants?
6045,Leonard,Well the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut Raj in half.
6046,Howard,Not the brush part just the little rubber thing to pick food from my teeth and massage my gums.
6047,Raj,Couldn’t leave him one friend could you?
6048,Howard,Your big problem is me telling her.
6049,Penny,Think I’ve been complaining too much about the movie?
6050,Sheldon,Mathematical. 32-ounce banana smoothie 16-ounce bladder.
6051,Sheldon,I can’t help it I feel like a teen heartthrob.
6052,Penny,Well thank you for sharing it with me. I won’t tell anyone.
6053,Penny,Why?
6054,Howard,Wait hold on. This is weird.
6055,Leonard,Doesn’t have to be tonight. I’m free pretty much always.
6056,Leonard,See she knew what always meant.
6057,Leonard,That’s very true.
6058,Penny,Wow.
6059,Leonard,Yeah he does but he got caught up in a computer game and…
6060,Sheldon,I do not agree. Cats make wonderful companions. They don’t argue or question my intellectual authority and this little guy here I think you’ll find to be quite zazzy.
6061,Raj,Whoa. Just trying to help.
6062,Leonard,Ja und later she’s going to arrest me for goink fashter zen da shpeed of light.
6063,Penny,Yeah mm-hmm. Amy it’s Penny. Hey. Just a little heads-up. Leonard bought a dining room table. Yeah. Sheldon’s breaking up with you.
6064,Howard,I was wondering if you’re free Friday. They’re having a Totally ’80s Night at the Greek. Hall & Oates Katrina and the Waves and three-fifths of Kajagoogoo.
6065,Sheldon,You’re right. Judas had the decency to hang himself after what he did.
6066,Leonard,I mean I know she’s not my girlfriend or anything but wouldn’t you think she’d feel a little bad that I’m going to be gone for the whole summer?
6067,Sheldon,I don’t know what you were worried about. I think it really works in the room.
6068,Penny,Did Leonard send you over here?
6069,Leonard,Sheldon why are you sitting by yourself?
6070,Raj,This looks terrible. She she’s gonna know.
6071,Penny,Yeah it kind of does huh?
6073,Howard,What?
6074,Sheldon,Very well. You seem to be headed somewhere. May I walk with you?
6075,Sheldon,Yes that’s what I think. And I’m super smart so it’s probably true.
6076,Sheldon,Leonard do you recall when I said that I was going to revolutionize humanity’s understanding of the Higgs boson particle and you said Sheldon it’s two a.m. get out of my bedroom?
6077,Leonard,It’s getting scary here too.
6078,Sheldon,Hi.
6079,Sheldon,We’re not done?
6080,Penny,Oh no no no not just a blanket. See it has sleeves. Yeah!  So you can you know be all snoodled up while you do your science stuff.
6081,Sheldon,You’re blowing it. We want to meet George Lucas and become his friends and play with him.
6082,Leonard,Uh fifteen…
6083,Sheldon,Penny Leonard. Would you be able to answer some questions I’m having about the events of last night?
6084,Leonard,No no honey if I take it off Sheldon wins.
6085,Sheldon,Attention all bowlers. I’ve taken the liberty of having these made for our rematch.
6086,Leonard,Yeah. Sure sure.
6087,Sheldon,Plane tickets and hotel reservations for a weekend away in San Francisco.
6089,Raj,I’ll let you know.
6090,Sheldon,That’s sad. Let’s ask ourselves is there anyone we know who would make a more manly and convincing son of Krypton?
6091,Sheldon,Allow us to answer a few quick ones that we get all the time. Uh uh yes I really am a doctor. Uh yes she really is my girlfriend.
6092,Leonard,Look at you being all mature.
6093,Leonard,Sixth grade but I wore a sport coat and carried a briefcase so…
6094,Leonard,No no-no-no I’m ready! I gave up the gift of sight for you. If that’s not moving on what is?
6095,Leonard,Listen I could never do what you’re doing okay? I would be terrified.
6096,Leonard,No no no. I I can’t do this. Believe me I really want to.
6097,Leonard,Sheldon doesn’t allow flossing that close to the mirror.
6098,Sheldon,Hey.
6099,Sheldon,Are you sure this is what you want to do?
6100,Howard,Here you go cute huh?
6101,Penny,Mm-hmm.
6102,Leonard,Yes.
6103,Sheldon,There’s a bird outside the window and he won’t go away. That is the hell that is going on. We have no worms or seeds here. Shoo shoo.
6104,Penny,Okay. Thanks.
6105,Raj,What do you mean?
6106,Sheldon,Thank you! Thank you so much!
6107,Sheldon,I think the word you’re looking for is bravo.
6108,Howard,Keep going.
6109,Leonard,Don’t worry. We’re planning to have sex right on the salad bar.
6110,Sheldon,Or do I hmm? Sir Isaac Newton wrote his Principia while convinced he was an armadillo.
6111,Leonard,Oh. Then I guess I’m in.
6112,Penny,I’m Penny I live across the hall. I’ve heard a lot about you.
6113,Howard,Yeah Leonard who?
6114,Leonard,What are you drinking there? A little eggnog?
6115,Raj,Fine I quit too.
6117,Sheldon,In what sense is that a compromise?
6118,Sheldon,Have fun presenting my lucky hunch.
6119,Penny,Why are you telling me this now?
6120,Sheldon,So how was your date?
6121,Leonard,Give me the phone.
6122,Howard,Excuse me I have selective mutism a recognized medical disorder. You’re just a douche.
6123,Leonard,Don’t say anything.
6124,Sheldon,Frenzy stance.
6125,Penny,Oh okay wild adventure. Oh frenzy stance isn’t working die you undead mummy die!
6126,Penny,Okay if you do something cool in science you might change the world. If I become a famous actress I’m not gonna tell you why movie stars are the best. They just are.
6127,Howard,I don’t believe it.
6128,Sheldon,Excuse me miss. I’d like to order lunch.
6129,Sheldon,I know. Go ahead mock me. Just use small words so I understand.
6131,Howard,Sitar music for her ringtone is not cool dude.
6132,Raj,Listen I love your charming racist humour but any chance you could not knock my religion while she’s here.
6133,Sheldon,How?
6134,Leonard,Call me if you need anything.
6135,Raj,That’s really nice of you Howard.
6136,Penny,Boy this is great. I haven’t had a vacation in ages.
6137,Leonard,maybe we should take a little break.
6138,Raj,Yes for you. I do however have a few conditions. First at all times I am to be treated as a colleague and an equal. Second my contributions shall be noted in all published material. And third you are never allowed to lecture me on Hinduism or my Indian culture.
6139,Raj,It’s okay I’m fine.
6140,Raj,Hey Stuart!
6141,Howard,You help me run my game.
6142,Sheldon,Same paradox. If you were to travel back in time and say knock me unconscious you would not then have the conversation that irritated you motivating you to go back and knock me unconscious.
6143,Penny,Not too bad for someone who doesn’t know what axiomatic means.
6144,Howard,Are you kidding me? This may be the biggest scientific breakthrough of our lifetime. How can you as a theoretical physicist not care about this?
6145,Penny,Okay so I’m an adult and the other day I saw an old man slip and fall down and I laughed. I mean I laughed hard. Like like out loud. If he was conscious he would’ve heard me.
6146,Penny,Well you’d have a terrific chance. I mean you’re smart you’re funny you have a cool job. You build stuff that goes into outer space.
6147,Penny,Yeah that’s kind of a problem.
6148,Leonard,Okay I understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me. I mean you can’t compete with me on an intellectual level and so you’re driven to animalistic puffery.
6149,Leonard,Yes.
6150,Penny,You’re talking about Leonard.
6151,Howard,And we still don’t know who framed him.
6152,Raj,So why don’t you get it fixed?
6153,Howard,How could you send her away?
6154,Penny,Okay what’s the big surprise?
6155,Leonard,Yeah he does but he got caught up in a computer game and…
6156,Sheldon,Well I know it was your idea but the reporter said he’s been following my work for a while and the only reason they even mentioned it in the magazine is ’cause my name is on it.
6157,Leonard,Oh good. Wasn’t sure it was coming across.
6158,Sheldon,My point is that you’re going to need to be careful. You used to be protected by your pre-Enlightenment mythology but now you’re going to need a stronger friend named latex.
6159,Sheldon,I already do.
6160,Raj,Let’s see what else can I tell you about me that would make you like me? Ooh I love music. Do you love music?
6161,Leonard,Okay. Well you kids have fun. I’m gonna go to sleep.
6162,Penny,You have Valentine’s plans? Which came out sounding way more surprised than I meant. Here let me try that again. You have Valent… See? I can’t do it.
6163,Penny,You know Raj honey you’re being too hard on yourself. When I first met you you couldn’t even talk to women. I mean you couldn’t even talk if one was in the room.
6164,Penny,Soft kitty warm kitty little ball of fur. Happy kitty sleepy kitty purr purr purr.
6165,Leonard,Maybe if it’s a cute little cuddly cat.
6166,Leonard,They don’t that’s why I saved this one.
6167,Penny,Oh come on. Childbirth is a natural beautiful uuurgh it’s like someone sawed a cow in half.
6168,Leonard,You understand why I’m doing this to you?
6169,Howard,Oh oh yeah and then there was the time when Leonard and I took Howard to Las Vegas and paid a hooker to pretend she was Jewish and that she wanted his little kosher pickle. Of all the Howard humping hookers stories that one’s my favourite!
6170,Leonard,I didn’t think he had it in him.
6171,Penny,What’s going on with them?
6172,Raj,You know there’s something I’ve always wondered about Aquaman.
6173,Sheldon,No. The syrup tastes better and I don’t like it.
6174,Sheldon,All right then. See? Just my valuables. My passport uh my will.
6175,Leonard,Remember uh a couple years back when I was on that research ship in the North Sea?
6176,Penny,he can scrape it off.
6177,Penny,Okay stop stop!
6178,Sheldon,Perhaps I could find someone better than Leonard. Someone I can rub in his face. Chris Pratt’s all the rage right now. I wonder how he’d feel about taking the smaller bedroom.
6179,Leonard,Excuse me your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that Superman’s flight is a feat of strength.
6180,Leonard,Thank you. You look very nice.
6181,Howard,And you knew about this this whole time?
6182,Leonard,Okay I I I think it’s safe to say that we’ve all done some things we’re not particularly proud of. But come on we’re friends. Friends overlook each other’s minor lapses. For the record Howard I’m sorry that I broke our pact.
6183,Leonard,That’s actually my napkin.
6184,Leonard,Huh? Some of this? And since it’s Thanksgiving an extra helping of this?
6185,Penny,No.
6186,Howard,Now who’s dying of jealousy? Oh it’s you.
6187,Leonard,Good night.
6188,Sheldon,At the movies Wolowitz always eats Raisinets.
6189,Leonard,Nice to finally meet you too.
6190,Sheldon,Leonard wait.
6191,Raj,I’d like to apologize for being insensitive. And for possibly making penguins seem like jerks because 99% of them are stand-up guys.
6192,Penny,Are you planning on sitting here?
6193,Penny,You can’t take something like that back. I mean what are we even supposed to do now?
6194,Penny,I I knew the answer. I got excited.
6195,Penny,Yeah give her a break from well come on.
6196,Leonard,You let a guy sit on me.
6197,Leonard,Thanks Wyatt. I’m a keeper.
6198,Sheldon,Why would she be expecting me?
6199,Penny,Yes. Well that is a good question. But is this really the best way to figure it out?
6200,Howard,Ooh I call Kermit.
6201,Sheldon,Leonard would you wrap it up? We’re waiting on you.
6202,Howard,Then we can be the Bengal Tigers.
6203,Sheldon,That’s what my train used to do.
6204,Sheldon,Would you have approved?
6205,Sheldon,What is there to talk about? You have to take it. It’s important.
6206,Howard,Howard the poor thing just got home from work. Let me get you a glass of wine. I’ll cook dinner.
6207,Leonard,You look very nice.
6208,Sheldon,You used my toothbrush?
6209,Penny,Okay uh let’s see. I’m from Nebraska and ever since I was a little girl I dreamed of moving to L.A. and becoming a movie star. Anyway after four years of acting lessons and waiting tables I’ve done a haemorrhoid commercial and a production of Anne Frank above a bowling alley. So you know dreams do come true. Your turn.
6211,Howard,Don’t put yourself down. You’re a very attractive man.
6212,Leonard,No.
6213,Howard,Like when my dog is mad at me she tells me by peeing in my slippers.
6214,Raj,Why are you holding hands? I forbid you to hold hands.
6215,Sheldon,Amy he’s my best friend and if you don’t take me I’m going there anyway.
6216,Sheldon,If you’re implying that I’d have some problem with him moving into my room you’re wrong. Raj is in a difficult financial situation and I’m glad that he’s making changes to improve it.
6217,Howard,All right but I have some conditions.
6218,Raj,I I said she but lot’s of things are she boats and cars whales like thar she blows!
6219,Howard,Okay here’s another one If a zombie bites a vampire and the vampire bites a human does the human become a vampire or a zombie? Or a zompire?
6220,Leonard,Sure. I’d like to meet her.
6221,Sheldon,Hmmph wrong.
6222,Raj,Okay uh I’m gonna own you bitch.
6223,Raj,See you. No wait take her number. I don’t want the temptation.
6224,Raj,Okay just put it on my calendar but start thinking of a reason why I can’t go alrighty? Koothrappali out. God bless that boy I don’t know what I’d do without him.
6225,Raj,How do you know that?
6226,Sheldon,Why would they say at least? Is it ten toggles? Is it a hundred toggles? You know? Is it a thousand toggles? Ten thousand toggles? A hundred thousand toggles?
6227,Penny,You really think so don’t you? 
6228,Penny,Well that’s great Raj. You must have so much in common.
6229,Leonard,Yeah you know what else it is?
6230,Penny,Oh I can’t believe he’s going to marry the girl he cheated on me with.
6231,Leonard,Wow that’s hard to believe.
6232,Penny,Sheldon what do you say to that?
6233,Raj,Oh God.
6234,Sheldon,Leonard please don’t take this the wrong way but the day you win a Nobel Prize is the day I begin my research on the drag co-efficient of tassles on flying carpets.
6235,Leonard,What’s all this?
6236,Leonard,So?
6237,Sheldon,As well you should. But I’m going to make an exception here.
6238,Sheldon,Brilliant. Men love Bluetooth.
6239,Leonard,You know exactly what I’m talking about.
6240,Leonard,Sheldon do you realize that driving is riskier than surgery?
6241,Raj,I’ve reconsidered your offer to let me work with you.
6242,Sheldon,Aw. Yeah this little guy can already recognize electronically transmitted images 20% faster than any other sample in Amy’s lab.
6243,Penny,Or a way for you to avoid her?
6244,Penny,You need me to shut the door so you can do your knocking thing?
6245,Raj,I just felt like drinking alone because I’m deep and dark.
6246,Sheldon,It was simple. I combined a well-known historical fact about Bohemia with the memory of my grandparents Mee-Maw and Pop-Pop singing Christmas carols while I sat in front of the fire and tried to build a high-energy particle accelerator out of Legos.
6247,Penny,Okay come on that’s not fair.
6248,Sheldon,Okay I just did. What was it?
6249,Sheldon,Should I follow you?
6250,Howard,Your next puzzle is a riddle. And who better to give it to you than The Riddler?
6251,Sheldon,You said we were invited.
6252,Penny,Oh kill me.
6253,Leonard,That’s pretty cool Sheldon.
6254,Leonard,A little but he’s basically harmless. He’s actually kind of a nice guy.
6255,Penny,Well you want a date pick a date.
6256,Sheldon,I don’t know. I looked around the room and I saw all the faces and the presents and it it was just too much.
6257,Raj,Oh please. Look in the mirror. You both look ten years older than I do.
6258,Sheldon,So in a way it’s like I’m your son.
6259,Sheldon,What? How should I know? Excited? Itchy? Give me the first letter.
6260,Leonard,Yes.
6261,Penny,Who me?
6262,Sheldon,No of course not. No I used trickery and deceit.
6263,Penny,Honey you can’t make people like each other.
6264,Leonard,Come on I would not have peed my pants.
6265,Penny,We’re married. We’re supposed to share everything.
6266,Penny,Sweetie once you stop paying rent none of this is really yours.
6267,Raj,That’s a Hanukkah present you’re regretting huh?
6268,Penny,Okay. Well I am going to take you shopping get you a nice suit. Might give you more confidence.
6269,Raj,Sheldon what if he gets his Internet from his cable company? He could lose his HBO and all their delightful original programming.
6270,Sheldon,Oh of course.  Did I mention the PS4 controllers light up?
6271,Penny,Yes it is.
6272,Leonard,Wait a minute. Sheldon spent a whole day with James Earl Jones and never told any of us.
6273,Penny,Thank you.
6274,Sheldon,Okay Leonard I know you’re concerned about disappointing me but I want you to take comfort from the knowledge that my expectations of you are very low.
6275,Sheldon,Can’t sleep?
6276,Leonard,Are you okay?
6277,Raj,But you don’t have sex with her either.
6278,Leonard,Yeah or you call me.
6279,Raj,No if we got Captain Reynolds from Firefly to do a signing at Stuart’s store that would be amazing.
6280,Leonard,I mostly just smell my nasal spray.
6281,Raj,Okay we’ve got fajitas with all the fixins so you make your own.
6282,Leonard,Is your tongue blue?
6284,Howard,You’re making me sound like a caveman.
6285,Penny,Yeah I think she’s pretty safe.
6286,Howard,I’m not defacing it I’m fixing it.
6287,Leonard,Okay well thanks for letting me know.
6288,Leonard,Was it out of respect that you didn’t tell Raj about the time you dropped his iPhone in a urinal?
6289,Howard,You know Sheldon…
6290,Sheldon,I may have failed.
6291,Penny,Alright yeah I don’t really know who they are…
6292,Leonard,I mean we were friends and now we’re more than friends. We’re whatever this is. But why label it right? I mean it is what it is and…
6293,Penny,I can’t believe Sheldon was gonna ask Amy to marry him.
6294,Sheldon,Yes. It’s very sweet. Now slowly and carefully flush him down the toilet.
6295,Leonard,Oh let me try.
6296,Sheldon,This is a game to you? Uh was the Battle of Antietam a game? Huh? Was the sack of Rome a game?
6297,Leonard,Is it? Hey everybody it’s five thirty in the morning!
6298,Sheldon,To send a message. She is not for you.
6299,Sheldon,I know. It’s also why I never open a door without knocking three times. I mean the first
6300,Howard,Did you pinky swear?
6301,Raj,Hang on hang on. There’s a 7-Eleven here. We smuggle Slurpies which are essentially Icees in under our coats after having a pleasant meal either here here or here.
6302,Sheldon,To be clear Leonard is referring to the gyroscope not the T-shirt and mugs. Oh now they own the mugs.
6303,Howard,But it’s true. But we-we put all your vital information into this dating site answered all their questions just like you would and they found a match for you. Her name is Amy Farrah Fowler.
6304,Penny,Oh. all right that’s cool no biggie. He said he’d help me set up my printer but I guess I can wait. What exactly is he doing up there?
6305,Penny,Hey how’s your sister?
6306,Sheldon,Whuh are we still doing the dumb thing? Okay why what’s wrong?
6307,Leonard,Well now you’re making me wonder if we should have met him at a neutral location.
6308,Sheldon,You’re a lucky man Leonard.
6309,Leonard,Great. Good night.
6310,Raj,Forgive me for staring but you’re very beautiful.
6311,Penny,If you mean it should end up in the same place then I agree. Is this your… your only tie?
6312,Penny,Ba-eye.
6313,Penny,Okay. See we should’ve done this last night you know have a little wine take the edge off.
6314,Sheldon,Um it’s fairly technical.
6315,Sheldon,But if we show up and you’re holding them she’ll think they’re only from you.
6316,Howard,Everything okay?
6317,Sheldon,Hello.
6318,Penny,Yes we did.
6319,Leonard,Bye.
6320,Sheldon,Well you’re an excellent neuroscientist you’re a wonderful girlfriend and…
6321,Sheldon,You’re kidding. What kind of maniacs have coitus in someone else’s bedroom?
6322,Penny,Come on.
6323,Howard,Wow it’s so cute.
6324,Leonard,Are you experimenting with nutritional suppositories again?
6325,Leonard,The third time I did it in skywriting but she never looked up.
6326,Sheldon,Yes?
6327,Sheldon,Oh all right.
6328,Howard,It’s not creepy. Don’t listen to him. Oh look who’s got the sweetest kisses.
6329,Sheldon,And may I point out she wouldn’t have asked me to go with her if you hadn’t been drunk and boring.
6330,Leonard,Oh another hug thank you.
6331,Sheldon,Let me remind you while my moral support is absolute in a physical confrontation I will be less than useless.
6332,Sheldon,Smart? I’d have to lose 60 IQ points to be classified as smart.
6333,Raj,I like comic books.
6334,Howard,Thanks.
6335,Penny,No no it’s probably just allergies.
6336,Leonard,Ah no kidding! A Fu Man Chu? A handlebar pencil?
6337,Raj,Keebler Elf? I’ve got your Keebler Elf right here.  Okay it’s a stalemate.
6338,Penny,No don’t you dare. You reject me right now and tie things up.
6339,Leonard,What the hell are you guys playing?
6340,Leonard,Yes.
6341,Leonard,About Stuart? Love to.
6342,Penny,Okay.
6343,Sheldon,Hey sweet ride.
6344,Howard,I’ve got the phone number of the tubby girl from Comic-Con.
6345,Raj,Oh beef I’m going to miss you so much. Do you know at the Mumbai McDonald’s you can’t get a Big Mac? All you can get is a Chicken Maharaja Mac. And the special sauce curry which in India
6346,Sheldon,Really more to organise you’re not actually dirty per se.
6347,Howard,It’s not a big thing. Just think of me as a brown Martha Stewart.
6348,Leonard,Well remember when you tried to learn how to swim using the internet?
6349,Raj,So then I went to Cambridge which was wonderful not only because it’s a good school but because it totally looks like Hogwarts. That’s where I fell in love with astronomy and now I’m an astrophysicist at Caltech so I guess you could say uh Raj is my name and stars are my game. And rhyming is also my game. So uh two games. Uh anyway that that’s enough about me. I want to hear everything about you.
6350,Sheldon,It has been suggested to me that acting techniques could improve my lecturing at which if certain tweets and blogs are to be believed I suck the big one.
6351,Leonard,Like you and Sheldon have everything figured out?
6352,Leonard,I can’t do that.
6353,Penny,Oh that’s a Venn Diagram and I remember because I thought to myself venn is he gonna stop talking about this diagram?
6354,Leonard,Oh hi Penny guess what? Sheldon got bongos.
6355,Sheldon,Good evening Leonard Howard Raj freeloader.
6356,Sheldon,Would you like to hear a classic Sheldon Cooper factoid?
6357,Howard,I don’t think I can walk right now.
6358,Penny,Leonard come on she’s your mom. If we can do something to make her happy why wouldn’t we?
6359,Howard,Not until now.
6360,Sheldon,Perform the experiment immediately.
6361,Howard,Shotgun.
6362,Sheldon,What?
6363,Sheldon,I can’t believe you’re not on my side. I was on your side when someone stole your car radio.
6364,Howard,Yeah to Howard. Um uh who’s next?
6365,Sheldon,Oh I appreciate the offer but Arthur is gone and there’s nothing I can do about it. When Darth Vader struck down Obi-Wan did Luke cry like a baby and go to his funeral?
6366,Leonard,Moo-stache.
6367,Raj,You look like a jackass.
6368,Raj,Thank you. 
6369,Leonard,Hi.
6370,Leonard,And I’m cool with surprises. But nothing on a Jumbotron. I don’t want to cry on a big screen like that.
6371,Sheldon,Oh good maybe he can build a nicer bridge to live under.
6372,Penny,Oh please I recognize the walk of shame when I see it. All you’re missing is a little smeared mascara and a purse with panties wadded up in it.
6373,Leonard,You had time to make a label for everything in this apartment including the label maker but you didn’t have ten seconds to make one that said urine cup?
6374,Leonard,Okay I know what you’re doing.
6376,Raj,Is it too late for him to cancel?
6377,Raj,Five four three two one. That’s too bad.
6378,Raj,Wait a second the good wife is crying. Something’s very wrong.
6379,Sheldon,Amy there were Chinese food containers in the trash can.
6380,Leonard,Sheldon I told you I only have access to the free-electron laser at night. I can’t drive you for the next few weeks.
6381,Howard,Very mature. Keep eating like that you’re gonna have a heart attack.
6382,Howard,There it is Priya. We’re Indian. We believe this stuff.
6383,Raj,Come in.
6384,Leonard,You might not want to do that.
6385,Leonard,Anything you’d like to say to him?
6386,Leonard,I’m single I don’t need this crap.
6387,Leonard,Okay okay. Guys what are we doing here?
6388,Raj,It’s not what I have it’s how many people I’m having it with.
6389,Sheldon,Excellent.
6390,Penny,Wait. What’s wrong with geology?
6391,Leonard,No.
6392,Sheldon,No. You’ve opened my eyes to the truth. Amy has made me a more affectionate open-minded person. And that stops now.
6393,Sheldon,You are lucky that this feelings machine doesn’t have feelings.
6394,Leonard,Penny are you okay?
6395,Howard,Run. Run run run. Don’t look back.
6396,Raj,Half of it will be mine.
6397,Penny,No talking.
6398,Penny,Good-bye Sheldon.
6399,Leonard,Really? You’re going to risk getting sleepy in the middle of your thermodynamic fluctuations seminar? You know what happens when you yawn in public.
6400,Sheldon,Would it come with Kung-Fu grip?
6401,Penny,No no no go ahead. I’ll come up with something mushy you’ll cry we got this.
6402,Sheldon,Not as well as we do.
6403,Leonard,That’s true.
6404,Penny,Good night Sheldon.
6405,Leonard,You video-chat with Amy all the time. How is this different?
6406,Penny,Yes.
6407,Leonard,Well for starters I wouldn’t eat the bananas.
6408,Penny,Okay thanks. Um I’m sorry listen could you do me a favour and not tell Bernadette how badly I blew this interview? She’ll get upset. And honestly I’m a a little terrified of her.
6409,Leonard,Couples sounds great. Or we could mix things up. Maybe pick names out of a hat. Whatever.
6410,Penny,Yep!
6411,Sheldon,How would I know do you have a low sperm count?
6412,Howard,I broke down and I read Lucy’s blog and in one of the entries she said when we first met I struck her as a little feminine.
6413,Raj,Hi. I’m good. Really good. Well I don’t know why I said really good. I’m just regular good. I really just wanted to sound confident. And that really was a real really not a fake really like the first really.
6414,Howard,You’re being unreasonable. Why can’t I have a desk?
6415,Sheldon,This is Greek food? Leonard you hate Greek food.
6416,Sheldon,What for?
6417,Howard,This is the worst. If we’re gonna get shot down we might as well just go to a bar and do it old school.
6419,Leonard,What’s going on?
6420,Sheldon,True but the more likely explanation for your attire is that you’re out of clean clothes again.
6421,Sheldon,I don’t see what’s crazy about bringing a backpack with your own toilet paper and Purell.
6422,Penny,Why are you being such a jerk?
6423,Sheldon,Your father may have spoiled you but I won’t. If you want a ticket to Comic-Con I suggest you figure out a way to earn the money yourself.
6424,Leonard,Water nymph.
6425,Howard,It was for the girls. They broke up with me I don’t care if they get fat.
6426,Penny,Well honey you don’t live with Sheldon any more. You can have anything you want.
6427,Sheldon,Oh.
6428,Leonard,You’re not sick. You just don’t want to face Kripke.
6429,Howard,What? You slept with my sister?
6430,Sheldon,Until I can transfer my intellect to a more durable container my body will remain safely ensconced in my bed.
6431,Leonard,Thank you. I…
6432,Leonard,Hang on. I’m counting. It’s okay.
6433,Sheldon,Then no thank you.
6434,Sheldon,Truthfully I’ve never given it any thought but it has been pointed out to me that you carry DNA of great potential.
6435,Howard,No no I don’t know if I should. If she wanted me to know about her blog she would’ve told me. It’s almost like I’m reading her diary.
6436,Sheldon,Can’t you hold it?
6437,Sheldon,Couple of questions about the plaque.
6438,Leonard,Right. Of course.
6439,Leonard,There’s something I wanted to run past you.
6440,Raj,Hey.
6441,Leonard,Just one second. Help Cinnamon’s loose in the building.
6442,Leonard,Glad I could help.
6443,Sheldon,Well I thought we were having a nice conversation but it turns out I was being offensive.
6444,Sheldon,It sounds like a uh contract might be in order.
6445,Leonard,Look at all these activities the university has. Rock climbing club archery flag football.
6446,Raj,Guys they’re gonna sell out.
6447,Sheldon,She did.
6448,Sheldon,Good thinking I’ll just be the muscle.
6449,Penny,And you’re stuck?
6450,Raj,Wait did Amy make her spinach dip?
6451,Raj,Dude the whole front came off. Now she’s gonna know I was snooping.
6452,Raj,That could have been about anyone. Besides you have nothing to worry about because now I’m the dusky half of Koothrapenny.
6453,Leonard,Hey you got a minute?
6454,Sheldon,No I wasn’t talking to Leonard.
6455,Howard,Hello Michaela.
6456,Raj,Rat-Man is nobody’s sidekick.
6457,Penny,Wait w-w-wait-wait-wait you’re ditching me to go look at comic books?
6459,Penny,Alright why don’t you just pick one at random and then if you don’t like it you can sit somewhere else next time.
6460,Penny,Hi Mike.
6461,Sheldon,Possibly but unverified.
6462,Raj,Okay we’ve got the cipher decoded.
6463,Sheldon,But candles? During a blackout? Are you mad? That’s a fire hazard. No Pasadena Water and Power recommends the far safer glow stick.
6464,Sheldon,My family took a trip to Florida when I was a child. A seagull stole a hot dog from me on the beach. I got the message.
6465,Penny,Oh I have a ton of errands to run. I need to make copies of my headshot send them off to agents and sign up for a new acting class.
6466,Raj,Get it? Because you clogged up her bathroom like a radioactive monster!
6467,Leonard,That’s just ridiculous. Why are you cooperating with him?
6468,Raj,Well we’ve all seen your mom. That Butterball turkey was bound to come home to roost.
6469,Sheldon,Now! Do it!
6470,Raj,Well uh for one thing you have bigger emotional problems than I do and I find that very attractive in a woman. I I don’t know. I just I think you’re wonderful.
6471,Sheldon,Since it’s not bee season you can have my epinephrine.
6472,Sheldon,Uh fun fact pontificate comes from the Latin word pontifex which means bridge builder or Pope.
6473,Penny,Goodnight Sheldon.
6474,Sheldon,Oh I forgot about Lee Meriwether.
6475,Penny,Ugh thanks a lot.
6476,Leonard,That was six years ago. I’m talking about tonight.
6477,Sheldon,I can’t. There’s a big dog outside. On the way home we can start thinking about methods of optimizing the detector for 500 GEV particles.
6478,Sheldon,Oh the bubbles tickle my nose. I’ll just open this now so it can get nice and flat before we drink it.
6479,Raj,So did you confront Jennifer?
6480,Sheldon,Thanks Mom.You’re the best.
6481,Raj,Oh hey Bernadette the swing comes with two different mobiles. The giraffes are pretty cute what do you think?
6482,Raj,But Daddy I I miss my family so much and with you and Mummy getting a divorce I feel sad and empty. Buying a little toy every now and then helps me fill that void. So while I can’t hug you every day flying that helicopter…
6483,Penny,This is ridiculous. You know I’m gonna go talk to the maître d’.
6484,Sheldon,Did it when I was four. It’s an icosahedral dye floating in tinted blue water.
6485,Sheldon,What if I choke on my popcorn who will administer the Heimlich manoeuvre.
6486,Sheldon,Leonard kicked me out of my own apartment. And his app team.
6487,Raj,You don’t want to do that. Refreezing not only removes moisture but it creates ice crystals in the fibres of the meat that can compromise its taste and texture. What? I saw a teachable moment. I dropped some culinary science.
6488,Raj,What’s like what is wrong with me? Why why can’t I ever have love?
6489,Sheldon,You said quantum coupling. That made me think of the show Quantum Leap. That’s a tangent and it’s your fault.
6490,Sheldon,I’m not saying you don’t have attractive qualities. Your choice of friends is impeccable you’re a good sleeper and last but not least you buy the grapes I like. You’re a real catch compared to some snoring guy with a fridge full of lousy grapes.
6491,Leonard,Thank you.
6492,Leonard,To be clear I meant like Bernadette not your mother.
6493,Sheldon,Well I could deduce by his facial expression and body language that he was sad.
6494,Raj,No. I’m looking for a hookup.
6496,Sheldon,By this much.
6497,Howard,You know who I blame for my loneliness? The United States of America. Your movies and your TV shows promised streets paved with beautiful blonde women with big bazongas.
6498,Leonard,What’s going on?
6499,Leonard,I don’t know uh Casper the alcoholic ghost?
6500,Sheldon,Oh. Well the real surprise is how surprised you are that I’m great at surprises.
6501,Penny,Night.
6502,Penny,What’s it for?
6503,Sheldon,I can see the ranch Leonard. Oh it’s rustic it’s lovely. I’d take a picture but people are chasing me. I’m gonna make it. I’m gonna make it. They have Tasers but they wouldn’t dare use… Aaaaaaagh!
6504,Howard,Fine. I will melt her heart. And her face.
6505,Leonard,Oh she’s mad at me because she just found out she’s married to Zack.
6506,Leonard,How did we get actual women?
6508,Sheldon,Yeah we’ll do it in two. Hi. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. I’m the actual brains behind this project. Also engineers aren’t real scientists MIT’s a trade school and the Death Star is from Star Wars not Star Trek. But otherwise thank you for your service.
6509,Leonard,Yes.
6510,Sheldon,Those are map coordinates. Got ’em. Let’s go.
6511,Penny,That’s what I told him when he asked me. I hope that’s not out of line.
6512,Raj,What about the money?
6513,Sheldon,Hello.
6514,Leonard,What?
6515,Sheldon,You don’t have the authority to save places in the line. If I do that I’ll be cutting.
6516,Howard,No. You take pretty girls underwater in your private submarine and you show them fish. Why does everything have to be dirty with you?
6517,Sheldon,Dancing?
6518,Sheldon,Hot air blowers are incubators and spewers of bacteria and pestilence. Frankly it would be more hygienic if they just had a plague infested gibbon sneeze my hands dry.
6519,Leonard,In this case you bet she is.
6520,Sheldon,I won’t be there.
6521,Sheldon,Uh you’re really going to have caffeine in front of me when I’m trying to get my life back on track?
6522,Raj,Hello.
6523,Sheldon,Back door has a five-pin tumbler system single-circuit alarm. Child’s play. You can start sorting protons and neutrons while I build carbon atoms.
6524,Raj,It’s going to be okay.
6525,Leonard,It’s important you know how much you mean to us.
6526,Sheldon,Mr. D’Onofrio? It’s Sheldon. They didn’t have anything barber-themed in the gift shop so I got you this. I don’t know if you can read his little T-shirt. It says um get well bear-y soon. Trust me if you were even a little conscious right now you’d be laughing. Anyway there’s new studies that show people in comas are aware of everything going on around them. With that in mind if you can hear me move away from the light and toward the sound of these scissors.
6527,Penny,Sheldon it’s just a box of rhinestones.
6528,Penny,Yeah just hang on Sheldon. You know why we can’t be together? Because you always have to be right.
6530,Leonard,Thanks again for doing this Bernadette.
6531,Raj,Well that didn’t go your way.
6532,Raj,Yeah she and my dad are going through a bit of a rough patch so I wanted to do something to let her know I was thinking about her.
6533,Leonard,He knows wow.
6534,Leonard,Mum’s the word. Sheldon are you sure you don’t want to just apologise to Gablehauser and get your job back.
6535,Penny,Well you know how he is. He’s sensitive and emotional.
6536,Sheldon,No I imagine if you were going to kill me you’d have done it a long time ago.
6537,Leonard,It’s not a matter of opportunity. We’re getting to know each other. There’s a learning curve.
6538,Penny,Who’s Amy?
6539,Howard,Okay we’re all set.
6540,Sheldon,No you weren’t listening. She said it’s not what it looks like.
6541,Sheldon,Excuse me but the sun is essential for all life on Earth. Frosty is merely a bit of frozen supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat. A crime by the way for which he is never brought to account.
6542,Leonard,Okay we saw them. Can we go catch the movie?
6543,Leonard,How was your day?
6544,Sheldon,Well I’m sorry. It’s not my fault. I’m just incredibly smart and everyone around here is dumber than a bag of rocks. Oh now don’t you start crying. You get in that spaceship. Mommy’s late for Indian bingo.
6545,Leonard,Okay great. Still not taking you to Switzerland.
6546,Sheldon,My thank you was not sincere.
6547,Penny,I am saying it is not a compliment to call me doable. It’s not sexy to stare at my ass and say “Ooh it must be jelly ’cause jam don’t shake like that.” And most important we are not dancing a tango we’re not to’ing and fro’ing. Nothing is ever going to happen between us. Ever.
6548,Sheldon,Oh yes. We had a tree we had a manger we had an inflatable Santa Claus with plastic reindeer on the front lawn. And to make things even more jolly there were so many blinking lights on the house they induced neighbourhood-wide seizures.
6549,Leonard,Uh cream.
6550,Howard,If you would just use the bucket you’d be so much more comfortable.
6551,Sheldon,Professor Norton although God knows why. He hasn’t published anything of note since he won that Nobel Prize.
6552,Penny,Sure sure.
6553,Penny,Then what’s the problem?
6554,Leonard,Hey!
6555,Leonard,No no it doesn’t matter we’ll be at work.
6556,Leonard,Oh could you clear off a shelf for me in the bathroom? I take a lot of medicine.
6557,Leonard,Wait for me.
6558,Sheldon,I suppose it is. In fact if you’d like to celebrate with a little music I’d be okay with that.
6560,Leonard,We want you back on the project with us.
6561,Raj,Sorry. I lost my cool.
6562,Raj,Dude why don’t you just invoke your girlfriend pact with Wolowitz?
6563,Sheldon,Well that’s still no reason to rush into anything. I mean look at us. We took things remarkably slow. You and I we didn’t even hold hands for two years.
6564,Howard,I keep telling you close the bathroom door.
6565,Leonard,Okay. Well then I’ll read it to you. It’s from the day we first met. Beauty thy name is Penny.
6566,Sheldon,If I see one scorpion I am getting on someone’s shoulders and never coming down.
6567,Leonard,I don’t know I just got a text. Come on hurry.
6568,Leonard,Well he’s having a rough time. Amy broke his heart the DVR cut off the last minute of Doctor Who. That crow followed him home.
6569,Leonard,So go hit on her.
6570,Raj,So have you figured out what you’re going to say to him?
6571,Howard,I’m telling you dude there’s a seat on the Hogwarts Express with your name on it.
6572,Howard,He’ll be so upset. He’ll probably climb up the Empire State Building and start swatting at planes.
6573,Sheldon,Hang on. Voilà the snowy tree cricket aka Oecanthus fultoni which is Latin for I’ll suck nothing. Of course I’m joking because the Latin for that is nihil exsorbibo.
6574,Leonard,If you ever need a break the owner of the train store will let you leave him there while you get a coffee.
6575,Sheldon,Event A. A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower. Event B. We drive half way across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman’s ex-boyfriend. Query on what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link between these events?
6576,Penny,You’re welcome sweetie.
6577,Leonard,Maybe we should just stop talking about this.
6578,Howard,Hey.
6579,Sheldon,In the pre-Christian era as the winter solstice approached and the plants died pagans brought evergreen boughs into their homes as an act of sympathetic magic intended to guard the life essences of the plants until spring. This custom was later appropriated by Northern Europeans and eventually it becomes the so-called Christmas tree.
6580,Howard,And then went back to the home they share where they probably fell asleep in the matching pajamas she got them because they both just love penguins.
6581,Howard,Hey Penny. Happy Star Wars Day.
6582,Raj,Saturday night at the comic book store they’re having a Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah tournament. First prize is five hundred dollars. If we team up we’d be unstoppable.
6583,Sheldon,Of course you are I’m warm and soothing. I’m like a human bowl of tomato soup.
6584,Leonard,Sheldon I promise. Your uvula does not have an STD.
6585,Raj,Magic wand TV remote?
6586,Penny,Leonard?
6588,Raj,Why are you telling me about my own culture?
6589,Leonard,That’s not what happened.
6590,Howard,You think you’re so cool because your wife is a person?
6591,Raj,No problem. Ooh you made little sandwiches.
6592,Howard,Oh. Something about latin music just makes me feel like I’m on a white sand beach in Rio.
6593,Penny,Hey guys. Congratulations.
6594,Howard,I think it’s an old storage room.
6595,Leonard,Okay I’m leaving for the conference.
6597,Howard,Oh. Mine was Winnie the Pooh. But anyway why don’t we just take a step back and start with a colour? Right? There are so many amazing ones. Red blue green purple.
6598,Sheldon,In addition your premise is flawed. In the original film Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimeaux with that very time machine. In Back to the Future Marty McFly got the opportunity to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother.
6599,Raj,He gave me his business card and asked me to please pass it along to Howard.
6600,Penny,Oh shut up!
6601,Howard,Oh you know. Same old same old. Looked through a telescope saw some stars. Big whoop.
6602,Raj,Barkeep! Alexander me.
6603,Raj,Yeah great.
6604,Leonard,Why do you have to give your paper to George Smoot?
6606,Raj,Fine I’ll leave. But it sounds like somebody needs a fresh diaper.
6607,Raj,Wow you just don’t get it do you? Buying me something pretty isn’t going to make our problem just go away.
6608,Leonard,Here we go.
6609,Penny,Yeah but we could get heart-shaped pancakes.
6610,Howard,Incredibly so.
6611,Howard,C3PO.
6612,Howard,Oh you’re so arrogant. If you were a superhero your name would be Captain Arrogant. And you know what your superpower would be? Arrogance.
6613,Penny,To pay my cable bill.
6614,Sheldon,No it’s not fine. It is a breach of line etiquette.
6615,Sheldon,45 seconds is plenty of time for a woman to walk through that door and fall in love with me. You know probably half that if I break out the old cow eyes.
6616,Raj,Well it’s not the balls-to-the-wall action of badminton or cricket but hey what is?
6617,Penny,Leonard’s Day?
6618,Leonard,Sheldon let it go. It’s not a big deal.
6619,Penny,No come on you’re not an idiot. Look just help me put it back up.
6620,Sheldon,But the turn-by-turn voice option isn’t on. I know I’d feel more safe if you turn on the turn-by-turn voice option. I love the turn-by-turn voice option.
6621,Penny,Oh please it’s not a time machine if anything it looks like something Elton John would drive through the Everglades.
6622,Sheldon,Well excuse me. That was not a betrayal that was an experiment to determine at what concentration food starts tasting mothy.
6623,Sheldon,Yay.
6624,Sheldon,Hello.
6625,Raj,Come on. What do you say? Let me make it up to you.
6626,Penny,And for the record bleugh. So what are you drinking?
6627,Penny,Or as I know him?
6628,Penny,I’m busy.
6629,Leonard,I’m still confused.
6630,Leonard,Sure. In my mind that broke the tension with comedy and led to sex.
6631,Sheldon,Oh I know that now. At first I thought she was cranky because of her horrific menstrual cramps but it turns out no she was genuinely mortified.
6632,Howard,Exactly.
6633,Sheldon,Are you trying to manipulate me?
6634,Howard,Let’s find out. Leonard ready?
6635,Penny,This is even better than you coming to the showcase because now I get to watch you watch me.
6636,Leonard,Here you go Penny. Shrimp with lobster sauce.
6637,Penny,Sheldon it’s C just put down C.
6638,Leonard,I don’t have a problem with Stuart. Besides he gives us a twenty percent discount at his comic book store.
6639,Leonard,You know all those terrible things bullies used to do to us?
6640,Sheldon,Okay.
6641,Leonard,Hmm. You’re up late.
6642,Leonard,No I’m not jealous I’m just a little concerned for her. I didn’t like the look of the guy that she was with.
6643,Howard,Here’s what I wonder about zombies.  What happens if they can’t get any human flesh to eat? They can’t starve to death they’re already dead.
6644,Sheldon,Ah. New topic. Women delightfully mysterious or bat-crap crazy?
6645,Penny,You know it is going to be difficult but I’m going to cancel my plans so I can do this for my bestie.
6646,Howard,Oh derived from the word angel. Appropriate.
6647,Howard,Would you rather go back to the apartment and deal with Sheldon or have a stranger carve out your corneas with a laser beam?
6648,Leonard,He takes it everywhere to bed to the bathroom.
6649,Leonard,You see those too.
6650,Sheldon,Yeah I do. They’re filling up on bread and ruining their meal.
6651,Leonard,Well maybe we are like Haroun and Tanweer.
6652,Sheldon,Did you pick up the low sodium soy sauce from the market?
6653,Leonard,Like I said complicated game.
6654,Sheldon,Yeah only after I eliminated all the obvious answers. You’re welcome.
6655,Sheldon,Not my problem. I just don’t understand how this happened to me. I’m scrupulous about my hygiene. I regularly disinfect my hands and I avoid contact with other people on general principle.
6656,Penny,No you do not.
6657,Leonard,We can’t afford to lose any more time.
6658,Howard,So all right there he is. So should we introduce ourselves?
6659,Sheldon,There’s a wet Band-Aid on the shower floor. .
6660,Howard,There was.
6661,Sheldon,The skills are transferrable. I just have no interest in going in the water.
6662,Leonard,Hey can I talk to you about something? It’s a little awkward.
6663,Raj,That was a lousy suggestion.
6664,Penny,Oh don’t apologize.
6665,Raj,And how you threw up in zero gravity and it floated back in your mouth. And you threw up again. And so on and so on.
6666,Penny,Wow really? Called my bluff. All righty then.
6667,Leonard,I wanted to tell you in the car but you told me to stop talking
6668,Penny,Aw.
6669,Leonard,Come on. It’s just a cup of coffee.
6670,Leonard,You do realize we’re allowed to have fun without you?
6671,Sheldon,I don’t know about you but I’m very uncomfortable with all this.
6672,Howard,That cannot be true.
6673,Raj,Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.
6674,Penny,Oh come on. Why? How bad could it be?
6675,Penny,What was all that about me trading sexual favours for material gain?
6676,Sheldon,This is not anyone’s home this is a swirling vortex of entropy.
6677,Raj,Also the pretty girl left.
6678,Leonard,Anythingforagreencard.com?
6679,Sheldon,And this is a schematic for a bird-trapping device that will ultimately backfire and cause me physical injury?
6680,Leonard,Sheldon get out here.
6681,Raj,Perhaps some of his mojo will rub off on us. Maybe between this and his beach house we will be inspired to greatness.
6682,Leonard,That helped.
6683,Penny,Amy.
6684,Sheldon,Try to put yourself in my place. Imagine you’re the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but dogs. And then it turns out there’s another human being.
6685,Penny,Yes to a poor waitress who loves a boot cut.
6686,Sheldon,The one that estimates the odds of making contact with extraterrestrials by calculating the product of an increasingly restrictive series of fractional values such as those stars with planets and those planets likely to develop life? N equals R times FP times NE times FL times FI times FC times L?
6687,Sheldon,No I said there’s nothing more important than me advancing science.
6688,Sheldon,What? Wh-Where did my cashew chicken come from?
6689,Sheldon,Homeostasis refers to a system’s ability to regulate its internal environment and maintain a constant condition of properties like temperature or pH.
6690,Leonard,How’s she doing?
6691,Sheldon,Interesting. I asked two women out today and they both said no.
6692,Penny,Damn okay I’ll just take the roof.
6693,Raj,Also uh cherries?
6694,Sheldon,This is Leonard. He’s your best friend in the world.
6695,Sheldon,Mountain Dew. Ah refreshing. Now we’re going to combine these chemicals with ordinary dish soap creating a little exothermic release of oxygen.
6696,Penny,Don’t you want to know for sure?
6697,Leonard,Okay Jimmy it’s time for you to go.
6698,Leonard,Okay now do you really need the honorary Justice League of America membership card?
6699,Howard,Uh yeah. Why do you ask?
6701,Sheldon,I’m coming.
6702,Penny,Oh thank you for coming.
6703,Leonard,I live here.
6704,Leonard,Well he’s not wrong. Howard did go to the International Space Station.
6705,Penny,I really thought he was gonna say let it go.
6706,Sheldon,How does that work?
6707,Penny,What’s that?
6708,Raj,When did you learn how to change a tyre?
6709,Sheldon,Well there’s always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter but Occam’s Razor would suggest that someone threw it out.
6710,Penny,Wow you don’t look that much alike.
6711,Penny,What’s the matter?
6712,Sheldon,No she doesn’t.
6713,Sheldon,Okay Howard’s on board. What do you think Leonard?
6714,Leonard,Oh yeah. It’s an extremely competitive cutthroat sport.
6715,Penny,Yes.
6716,Leonard,A joke. Okay. How about this um okay uh there’s this farmer and he has these chickens but they won’t lay any eggs. So he calls a physicist to help. The physicist then does some calculations and he says um I have a solution but it only works with spherical chickens in a vacuum.  Right?
6717,Sheldon,Well regardless she has a distinct advantage in all tavern-based competitions. Pool beer pong wet T-shirt contests they’re all out.
6719,Howard,It’s one of his best moves.
6720,Penny,Okay. You know I’ve always been curious. What was Leonard like when he was little?
6721,Leonard,Penny you’ll have to excuse Sheldon he’s a bit of a germophobe.
6722,Penny,It’s this Friday at eight you guys want to come?
6723,Raj,Just because you’re starving doesn’t make you an artist.
6724,Leonard,I’m not jealous. I just think it’s silly for you to compare relationships like they’re something that can be quantified.
6725,Howard,Oh but there’s money for a drawer full of Red Vines a marshmallow shooting rifle and a super executive ant farm with glow-in-the-dark sand?
6726,Raj,Oh I have an idea.
6727,Penny,Well you saw her the other night. Am I wrong?
6728,Raj,Megan Pincus.
6729,Howard,Lame characters with silly ac… what kind of actress are you?
6730,Sheldon,Assuming that’s a valid reason not to go which it isn’t how do you know this? Did she say it?
6731,Penny,I know.
6733,Leonard,No.
6734,Sheldon,Not really. Apparently grief can make one less regular.
6735,Sheldon,This is how you’re going to entertain your little cousin and his friends? By lying to them?
6736,Leonard,Zack?
6737,Leonard,They have some board games.
6738,Sheldon,On my twelfth birthday I really wanted a titanium centrifuge so you know I could separate radioactive isotopes.
6739,Sheldon,But what if he does? I’ll be obliged to dine on liver and lungs stuffed in a sheep’s stomach. And frankly blood pudding is essentially the same thing. I don’t know why he’s serving both.
6740,Sheldon,Well as you may know I’ve been experimenting with elevated anxiety levels and I thought what better way to increase my discomfort than to subject myself to an evening of tasteless uncensored crotch talk?
6741,Howard,Yeah. Sack up dude.
6742,Penny,Pathetic. All of you completely pathetic. 
6743,Penny,He was gonna throw it in the washing machine with his Spiderman underwear. That’s our Lenny huh?
6744,Howard,Hi!
6745,Penny,Well you know how they gave me the company car? Didn’t make sense to have two so I sold the other one.
6747,Sheldon,No no. The comforting part is that the Germans have a term for what you’re feeling. Weltschmerz. It means the depression that arises from comparing the world as it is to a hypothetical idealized world.
6748,Sheldon,Am I okay? Leonard I’m on a lifelong trajectory that includes a Nobel Prize and cities named after me all four wisdom teeth fit comfortably in my mouth without need of extraction and my bowel movements run like a German train schedule. Am I okay?
6749,Leonard,I don’t know. Maybe.
6750,Leonard,That narrows it down.
6751,Raj,So my visa’s only good as long as I’m employed at the university and when they find out I’ve got squat they’re going to cut me off. By the way when I say squat I mean diddly-squat. I wish I had squat.
6752,Sheldon,I can’t. I’m naked.
6753,Sheldon,I assume you’re referring to the sea shanty. It’s a rhythmic work song designed to increase productivity.
6754,Sheldon,Amy I don’t understand are we broken up or not? It’s like you can’t make up your mind.
6755,Sheldon,Want me to sing it again?
6756,Leonard,You’re my surrogate family?
6757,Sheldon,No wait. Perhaps I should sleep here so you don’t miss Leonard as much uh ’cause you’re being kind of a baby about it.
6758,Leonard,Isn’t that confusing? AA might mean something else to certain people.
6759,Leonard,Like what?
6760,Sheldon,If someone as damaged as you can find his way to crawl out of bed each morning I think I can face a simple award ceremony.
6761,Leonard,You’re right. But what? Mexican? Italian? German? Indian? Greek? Cuban? Chinese? Pizza? Barbecue? Korean? Korean barbecue?
6762,Sheldon,Excuse me. Do you have any books about making friends?
6763,Sheldon,That’s a somewhat ambiguous response. Am I going or not?
6764,Leonard,All right. I like a good brainteaser. Give it a whirl.
6765,Raj,Can you say it again for me?
6766,Leonard,Bye Sheldon.
6767,Howard,Yeah we have plans this weekend. And if it’s a clear night I’m gonna lay some romantic astronomy on her.
6768,Sheldon,Why are you shaking? Are you cold?
6769,Leonard,Here you want my peas?
6770,Howard,Why wouldn’t you take Penny?
6771,Penny,Well it’s a fun sweater it’s got a bold geometric print.
6772,Leonard,I don’t know who you talked to but that wasn’t my mother.
6773,Leonard,Kidding. Just a couple of friends goofin’ around.
6774,Sheldon,If we poison the critical thinking faculties of children by telling them that rabbits come out of hats then we create adults who believe in astrology and homeopathy and that Ryan Reynolds was a better choice for Green Lantern than lovable rogue Nathan Fillion.
6775,Sheldon,Yeah wait Raj where do you stand on the anthropic principle?
6776,Raj,Oh there it is now that you don’t have a girlfriend you want to hang out with me again.
6777,Leonard,And his girlfriend Amy.
6778,Penny,E equals MC squared. Yeah. E is for energy M for mass and C for the speed of light.
6779,Leonard,Hi Penny how’s it going. Listen that guy Mike that you were dating is that still going on?
6780,Leonard,It’s David Underhill. So what?
6781,Sheldon,I told you she made spaghetti with little hot dogs. I like spaghetti with little hot dogs.
6782,Sheldon,The best way to achieve a goal is to devote 100% of your time and energy to it. When I decided I was going to be a physicist I didn’t take some other job in case it didn’t work out. Which wasn’t easy because there was a lot of pressure from Ms. Pearson for me to be chalk monitor that year.
6783,Sheldon,Oh. Uh uh she liked it fine. But she doesn’t have the history with the franchise I do.
6784,Sheldon,Of course not. And technically magic beans would be food although eating them would be quite a waste since you could plant them and overnight have a giant beanstalk which would provide enough roughage for a small city.
6785,Penny,So you know isn’t there maybe some way you and Sheldon could compromise on this whole presentation thing.
6786,Howard,I was quoting a man who knows a thing or two about women Sir Elton John.
6787,Leonard,Yeah good for you.
6788,Sheldon,I don’t feel different this alcohol’s defective.
6789,Howard,You know you and I have so much fun hanging out. If you were a girl all our problems would be solved.
6790,Sheldon,You know for a Thanksgiving buffet in an aquarium cafeteria that was really bad.
6792,Leonard,Yeah.
6793,Sheldon,Oh good. You picked me you picked me.
6794,Leonard,Thanks. It’s good.
6795,Penny,Don’t take advice from a man who threw his shoe at a crow.
6796,Sheldon,Don’t sign anything? That’s your advice? Okay so uh if during this meeting one of us were to say complete an oil painting you’d recommend that we leave that unsigned?
6797,Sheldon,No he didn’t do anything. So I said you just saw me jaywalk why aren’t you doing your job? You know? May maybe I should arrest you for for impersonating a police officer.
6798,Howard,What if we brought them down with us?
6799,Sheldon,Is this the fellow who peed in your Hawaiian Punch?
6800,Leonard,Once I found a stash of contracts under his bed. It was weird.
6801,Leonard,I know it only takes one doctor’s finger.
6802,Sheldon,So first there was PlayStation aka PS1 then PS2 PS3 and now PS4. And that makes sense. You’d think after Xbox there’d be Xbox 2. But no next came Xbox 360. Hmm? And now after 360 comes Xbox One. Why one? Maybe that’s how many seconds of thought they put into naming it.
6803,Leonard,Just look at the board.
6804,Howard,But you’re a dentist he’s nuts.
6805,Howard,You mean one of the hopeless geeks? No. Those are crazy people. Howard be a dear and get me another one of these. Now him he’s one of those geeks.
6806,Sheldon,Homesick is a type of being sick.
6807,Sheldon,Wow Amy’s mad and Leonard was right. What a weird day.
6808,Sheldon,Jibber-jabber? I don’t jibber-jabber.
6809,Sheldon,I’m not sure how listening to other nine-fingered banjo players makes me dog but all right.
6810,Raj,Are there any chopsticks?
6811,Howard,Well to be honest Leonard’s on the other line and he offered me their spare bedroom.
6812,Penny,Oh jeez you’ve got to be kidding me.
6813,Leonard,Oh a little Red Dead Redemption huh?
6814,Raj,It’s very nice of you I would like that.
6815,Howard,I really like my saber-toothed cat. Thank you.
6816,Leonard,What?
6817,Leonard,I don’t know what to tell you. Buy her something.
6818,Howard,You’re a good friend. I owe you one.
6819,Raj,Sounds great!
6820,Howard,Okay yup. See see that that looks like that looks like they could be bigger. But you know I bet I bet when I do it mine do the same thing.
6821,Penny,Wait. What are you talking about?
6822,Penny,You know I’m gonna read it either way.
6823,Leonard,So what do you think we can learn from that behaviour that we can apply to our own lives?
6824,Raj,Got a hot girlfriend now. I want the haters to know.
6825,Leonard,Really? Why?
6826,Leonard,Hi.
6827,Penny,Okay the point is one of the ways we show we care about people is by putting thought and imagination into the gifts we give them.
6828,Penny,Yes it is. That’s why I broke up with him he always does stuff like that.
6829,Leonard,So much for our friendship with Sheldon.
6830,Leonard,Wish we weren’t so far from my parking space.
6831,Sheldon,Where?
6832,Sheldon,Is he making any progress? Because I’d like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil.
6833,Leonard,I don’t think George Lucas put his headquarters in the middle of nowhere because he wanted people dropping in.
6834,Leonard,Do you understand why people don’t want to play with you?
6835,Howard,You’re gonna have to be quieter than that.
6836,Sheldon,Why are you crying?
6837,Sheldon,Sorry. I need to work on this engine so when I get to the train yard I won’t look foolish.
6838,Leonard,We don’t say that either. I’ll make you a list.
6839,Leonard,You might want to check YouTube.
6840,Leonard,We’re gonna have so much more fun than him.
6841,Penny,Well I don’t have any. You’re kind of making me look bad.
6842,Sheldon,I’m actually more of a theorist.
6843,Sheldon,You don’t need chopsticks this is Thai food.
6844,Sheldon,I’m quite familiar with plumbing. Not to brag but I spent most of fifth grade with my head in a toilet.
6845,Leonard,Beats the hell out of me.
6846,Penny,Oh no no. We said we were going to hang out let’s hang out.
6847,Penny,Oh too bad well I got to get to rehearsal see you guys.
6848,Howard,Not much but he seemed to be in a pretty good place.
6849,Sheldon, Good morning.
6850,Sheldon,I never realized this building was classified.
6851,Sheldon,I’m not being weird. I it’s hard to explain.
6852,Penny,Oh oh good because um his mother called me.
6853,Leonard,Sheldon don’t you think you’re overreacting?
6854,Howard,Looks good.
6855,Howard,So you’re a dental student? Hmm are you aware that dentists have an extremely high suicide rate? Not as high as say air traffic controllers but then there are far more dentists than air traffic controllers so in pure numbers you’re still winning.
6856,Penny,You know it’s bad enough what happened but then he tried to hide the fact that he sees her all the time at the university.
6857,Leonard,It’s like when I started doing chin-ups I didn’t want you to see until I could do one. FYI really close.
6858,Leonard,Who‘s there?
6859,Penny,Unbelievable.
6860,Sheldon,Given that when we met her she was finishing law school and planning an internship at a large Indian car company it’s actually extremely plausible.
6861,Sheldon,I was talking with Penny.
6862,Sheldon, Penny.
6863,Penny,Sorry.
6864,Penny,Okay.
6865,Sheldon,And a funny Greek letter.
6866,Howard,You really think so?
6867,Sheldon,Potato clock. Do potato clock.
6868,Sheldon,No turbulence is just the equalization of diurnal temperature variations in the atmosphere. I’m not scared at all. Oh apple juice stay where you are.
6869,Leonard,Stay out of it Kevin Smith.
6870,Leonard,You sure you want to do this?
6871,Sheldon,How do I get 12-year-old girls excited.
6872,Sheldon,Oh you have to say that you’re sweet on me.
6873,Leonard,No he lives here now.
6874,Sheldon,Nonsense. I look like a train conductor. Under what pretext did you lure her here?
6875,Leonard,Hey she didn’t compromise. She settled. There’s a difference.
6876,Leonard,There’s no music.
6877,Howard,Yeah great. Um I’ll put food in her top half you deal with whatever comes out the bottom.
6878,Sheldon,He is getting a lot of work done. He had a pretty interesting take on proton decay.
6879,Penny,Sheldon she doesn’t want your stupid…
6880,Sheldon,Oh that’s nonsense. I mean you tell me stories about your day all the time. I don’t care how they end.
6881,Sheldon,But who’s gonna tell them they’re doing it wrong?
6882,Raj,Mmm I love how they put a waterfall at centre field. It really ties the whole stadium together.
6883,Penny,What?
6885,Leonard,Thank you.
6886,Howard,Thank you. That’s why I say Keaton’s number one. He brought a sense of humour to the role.
6887,Howard,I’m sorry?
6888,Sheldon,Forgive me Penny but that would be the very definition of a frivolous lawsuit.
6889,Sheldon,Hello to you insufficiently intelligent person.
6890,Raj,Excuse me I think how could you she’s my sister takes precedence over a five year old pinky swear!
6891,Penny,I know. Every Saturday at 815 easy to anticipate.
6892,Sheldon,Oh. You must be one of those dessert before dinner people.
6893,Penny,Well you’re the one worried having someone live with us is a sign of problems.
6894,Raj,What? What about the mission? You said we were a real-life landing party.
6895,Leonard,I’m very hungry. For food right?
6896,Raj,Leonard what are you talking about?
6897,Sheldon,All games are made up. They’re not found in nature. You don’t just dig in the ground come across a rich vein of Rock’em Sock’em Robots.
6898,Penny,I was just hungry and cranky and I’ve never been called ma’am before.
6899,Sheldon,All right everyone pay attention. Yes I have a friend named Amy Farrah Fowler. Yes she is female. Yes we communicate on a daily basis but no she is not my girlfriend.
6900,Sheldon,Okay we don’t have that in stock but I can special order it for you.
6901,Leonard,I am not a crybaby.
6902,Raj,Howard please you can’t treat the man differently just because he’s disabled. That’s not okay.
6903,Penny,Hi. Sure.
6904,Penny,All right let’s go.
6905,Raj,Congratulations. Does it have that new car smell?
6906,Penny,Good night you.
6907,Howard,Maybe that’s what they want to talk about.
6909,Raj,Mine says To Raj from Stan Lee.
6910,Raj,What’s this button do?
6911,Raj,All right. Great.
6912,Sheldon,I’m concerned about Amy. She’s acting a bit odd lately.
6915,Raj,He’s right. This is an important achievement for two reasons. Number one and of course number two.
6916,Leonard,Guys tickets already went on sale.
6917,Raj,Did you get a Japanese love pillow?
6918,Sheldon,Fine! Smoot-Cooper. Wow what a diva.
6919,Penny,No.
6920,Sheldon,Evolution isn’t an opinion it’s fact.
6921,Raj,I was quoting a man who knows a thing or two about women Sir Elton John.
6922,Raj,We are now.
6923,Sheldon,Wolowitz went to MIT. What’s your educational background?
6924,Howard,You know that hurts my feelings.
6925,Sheldon,Let me put it this way do you own a barrel and suspenders?
6926,Penny,You’re unbelievable.
6927,Raj,Oh Double Stuffed Oreos I remember when I could afford you.
6928,Leonard,Right.
6929,Penny,That is the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.
6930,Penny,What? Tha… That is not true.
6931,Penny,Oh yeah? well there’s a difference between being a jerk and being an ass!
6932,Penny,Well where you going just put them on.
6933,Raj,Oh please allow me. That’s a lot of empty calories.
6934,Sheldon,Okay. Amy will be here shortly expecting the perfect Valentine’s gift so you’re up kid. Dazzle me. Go.
6935,Sheldon,I may have left a suggested organisational schematic for her bedroom closet.
6936,Penny,Ubabsubolubutubly ubi duboo.
6937,Leonard,My dad was an anthropologist. The only father-son time he spent was with a 2000-year-old skeleton of an Etruscan boy. I hated that kid.
6938,Sheldon,Wait. I’m a little concerned. Blueberries are rich in antioxidants.
6939,Penny,Oh. Good for you.
6940,Sheldon,What?
6941,Raj,Maybe he didn’t know what to pair champagne with. Strawberries caviar oysters. All good choices. Yeah that look right there is why people eat before they come to your parties.
6942,Leonard,Unsweetened almond…
6943,Penny,All right come on just try it my way. Pretend you’re sad to see him go. I’m gonna lead you in. His unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy. That’s your cue.
6944,Penny,You also got a nosebleed watching Up.
6945,Sheldon,He can’t eat cheesecake he’s lactose intolerant.
6946,Leonard,Uh let’s see. Uh I am an experimental physicist at Cal-Tech most of my research is with high-powered lasers and oh I’ve just gotten a big government grant to see if they can be used to knock out incoming ballistic missiles.
6947,Leonard,Okay I know you’re upset and there’s a lot of stuff going on but it’s nothing we can’t work out. Come on let’s get you home.
6948,Raj,What do you suppose she meant by that?
6949,Sheldon,I know that if I had a wife or a fiancée I’d ask her first before I invested money in a comic book store.
6950,Howard,No I I won’t. I’m I’m unlovable.
6951,Sheldon,As a result you have taken the most important step on the road to success learning what not to do. Now let’s start fresh. Howard we’re going to need some tea.
6952,Penny,What is wrong?
6953,Penny,It really has.
6954,Raj,Non-alcoholic bee-ee-eeuh 
6955,Howard,I’ll tell you what how about we go rock-paper-scissors?
6956,Leonard,No I can’t look at you or your avatar right now.
6957,Howard,Uh-huh.
6958,Penny,Oh come on you went to college.
6959,Sheldon,233 if we include the one somebody forgot to press record on.
6960,Raj,He probably just goes to the bathroom.
6961,Sheldon,Now?
6962,Sheldon,But I would like to remind you that in science there’s no such thing as failure. There once was a man who referred to his prediction of a cosmological constant as the single biggest blunder of his career. That man’s name was surprise surprise Albert Einstein.
6963,Leonard,What?
6964,Sheldon,Well I would love to help you but since I discovered the satisfaction of working with my hands on a train engine I don’t think I can go back to theory. I’m an engineer now. And hey just to be clear a train engineer. Not that goofy kind you are.
6965,Sheldon,So Leonard how goes the mimesis?
6966,Sheldon,What difference does it make?
6967,Howard,Prostitute.
6968,Sheldon,No it’s not fine. What kind of store in the 21st century doesn’t at least have Wi-Fi? I’m going to call their corporate office. Son of a biscuit.
6969,Penny,Yep.
6970,Penny,I don’t know what to do. My car threw a rod and it’s totaled. I can’t afford a new one I have no job and now I can’t drive to auditions.
6971,Penny,Oh no not at first. Right after I pointed it out.
6972,Sheldon,Today it’s a Chinese food retrieval robot. Tomorrow it travels back in time and tries to kill Sarah Connor.
6973,Raj,Go ahead tell my parents why they won’t have any grandchildren.
6974,Leonard,Okay.
6975,Howard,So?
6976,Penny,Whatever. Ooh I’m gonna get the cheesecake out of the fridge.
6977,Raj,Uh pull over.
6978,Raj,On Sesame seed Bunzillas.
6979,Penny,No no no you can’t. Your career is far too important.
6980,Leonard,I’ve got a solution.
6981,Penny,Guess it would be fun to be Cinderella.
6982,Sheldon,Because I’m a fraud. No. I purport to be a man of the mind. I’ve been such a a vocal champion of the singularity but how can I leave my body behind and become one with the internet when I’ve never even thrown a toothbrush away?
6983,Leonard,What?
6984,Sheldon,And you said there’d never be enough pasta for the three of us.
6985,Sheldon,Remarkable. Diamonds crystallized carbon. Every day people go to the grocery store and come home with sacks full of carbon in the form of charcoal briquettes that they toss in their barbeques and set on fire. But just because you’ve got some carbon with the atoms stacked neatly you expect me to plunk down thousands of dollars.
6986,Leonard,Not helping buddy. Mother Penny and I really want you to be part of this. Please stay.
6987,Sheldon,I need soup.
6988,Leonard,We got him. We’re almost done.
6989,Sheldon,When in the course of human events it becomes necessary to dissolve the bonds that tie three competent scientists together…
6990,Howard,Excuse me. I’m here to pay my respects to Professor Tupperware or whatever his name is.
6991,Raj,And snacks.
6992,Leonard,Yes I have it’s just a matter of actually making a date with someone.
6993,Sheldon,Yes. Now should that happen I would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido.
6994,Raj,So if the fact that your husband left you makes you feel unattractive just remember penguins get cheated on and they’re adorable.
6995,Raj,Are you sure you’re not him? Uh you can tell us. We’re scientists not crazy fanboys.
6996,Raj,We could play outside.
6997,Penny,You know I’m very proud of you for trying to live with Amy.
6998,Sheldon,What? Did she do it yet?
6999,Sheldon,Yeah me too. I was stuck for a metaphor.
7000,Leonard,Okay.
7001,Howard,Now don’t blame yourself. He was a groveller from way back. But the point is the two of you got past it. And Leonard you go and propose to this poor girl in the middle of sex? That was some weak tea dude.
7002,Sheldon,Hold on. You honestly expect me to believe that social protocol dictates we break our backs helping Wolowitz move and then he only need buy us a pizza?
7003,Sheldon,Said the Grinch to Christmas.
7004,Penny,What do you want me to tell you Sheldon?
7006,Sheldon,All right this is about me and him you’re not part of it. Stuart perhaps we do take you for granted and that is not acceptable. Please know that you truly are a valuable member of our social group.
7007,Howard,Sheldon did we all not just watch the same video? Kripke’s robot just had angry sex with a mid-sized automobile.
7008,Penny,Yeah I’m gonna go. It’s just not my idea of a good time.
7009,Leonard,Hi. Well uh oh welcome to the building.
7010,Sheldon,Well I thought he made that up. Isn’t hypochondria a common idiosyncrasy of Jewish people?
7011,Howard,Sheldon it’s your play. Sheldon.
7012,Sheldon,Oh I think that sounds wonderful.
7013,Penny,Really? For a wedding?
7014,Howard,You suck Wolowitz.
7015,Penny,Supper?
7016,Sheldon,Why would you knock over a lamp?
7017,Raj,I don’t mean to burst your bubble dude but those penile enlargement pills do not work.
7018,Penny,I’m suggesting there might be something you could do about Amy’s urges?
7019,Sheldon,Oh he didn’t perform stand-up comedy he was a philosopher.
7020,Raj,I feel bad for the guy.
7021,Sheldon,Yeah and talked about physics with them.
7022,Leonard,Why are you learning Chinese?
7023,Sheldon,Mohammed Lee.
7024,Penny,Do I really force you to do things you don’t want to?
7025,Sheldon,Oh I can’t believe that.
7026,Penny,For what?
7027,Leonard,It was us. We knocked over a lamp.
7028,Penny,You’re kidding.
7029,Leonard,I don’t know. Maybe because I’m crazy?
7030,Raj,He’s selling the Sword of Azeroth on ebay.
7031,Sheldon,I forgot to tell you the sandwich is promiscuous.
7032,Sheldon,Please please please please please please please.
7033,Leonard,Sure.
7034,Leonard,It’s a blanket with sleeves.
7035,Raj,Would you like to go with me?
7036,Sheldon,Well I’m sorry is the winner of the physics bowl the team that has the most fun?
7037,Howard,I think we were misled about the cute girls.
7038,Leonard,Oh how’s it going? You taking Hollywood by storm?
7039,Leonard,That was almost a minute.
7040,Leonard,I’m your son. What about the fact that she’s good enough for me?
7041,Howard,Sounds fun.
7042,Sheldon,What’s wrong?
7043,Howard,I would never call Howard.
7044,Howard,Nothing to worry about. People meet people all the time and it isn’t weird. I met Bon Jovi once which you’d think might be weird. Turns out total sweetheart.
7045,Leonard,Are you thinking about adding a desiccant like calcium sulphate?
7046,Sheldon,Aw nuts! One…
7047,Leonard,No kidding?
7048,Sheldon,Congratulations. You may not have succeeded in getting cash but you did secure a formal acknowledgment of the debt. 
7049,Raj,Hey Stuart I see you’re getting ready for your Halloween party.
7050,Sheldon,Actually he might have to. There’s an economic concept known as a positional good in which an object is only valued by the possessor because it’s not possessed by others. The term was coined in 1976 by economist Fred Hirsch to replace the more colloquial but less precise neener-neener.
7051,Sheldon,And you haven’t fallen hopelessly in love with me?
7052,Leonard,Anyway wish me luck.
7055,Sheldon,Oh very well. What have you been working on? And feel free to honk during the boring parts.
7056,Sheldon,Hold.
7057,Sheldon,What are you smiling at?
7058,Howard,How about Lasic?
7059,Raj,Boy Sophie could have used a time machine in that movie. Did you see it it’s rough.
7060,Leonard,I need you to apologize to How…
7062,Raj,Go away. 
7063,Penny,Oh it’s okay I didn’t really need to work today it’s not like I have rent or car payments or anything.
7064,Penny,Okay how about we toast your newfound freedom?
7065,Leonard,I’ve never been there have you?
7066,Sheldon,Well of course you don’t you’ve never excelled at anything.
7067,Penny,May I take your cloak?
7068,Sheldon,Well this is confusing for me. But I don’t want to stand in the way of your happiness. So I’ll condemn you internally while maintaining an outward appearance of acceptance.
7069,Penny,Really? You don’t sound so sure.
7070,Sheldon,Nothing I just really didn’t want to come. Virgin diet cuba libre please.
7071,Leonard,Come on. We’re gonna have sex and it’s not gonna mean a thing!
7072,Leonard,Okay I’d better go in there and talk to him.
7073,Sheldon,I’ll I’ll let you get back to sleep now. Good night.
7074,Penny,Oh look at us. Our last Thanksgiving as husband and wife.
7075,Sheldon,The fun starts with brunch at Carney’s in Studio City a hot dog stand in a converted railroad dining car. Next stop Travel Town an outdoor museum featuring 43 railroad engines cars and other rolling stock from the 1880s to the 1930s. Finally we’re off to the glitz and glamour of Hollywood for dinner at that’s right the Hollywood Carney’s a hot dog stand in a different converted railroad dining car.
7076,Leonard,I doubt it.
7077,Sheldon,Okay first of all that’s a comparison of quality not intensity. Secondly Star Trek I is orders-of-magnitude worse than Star Trek V.
7078,Penny,You’re going to go down swinging huh? All right well we got your body lotion your InStyle Magazine your jewellery box.
7079,Raj,Boy I’m so hungry today. I wonder why?
7080,Sheldon,Is that a yes or a no on the freezer? The woman has the attention span of a gnat.
7081,Raj,What kind of superhero says dibs on the red tights dibs on the red tights.
7082,Leonard,You’re thirty years old and you live with your mother.
7083,Howard,You call yourself a friend? I was trying to help you and at the first sign of trouble you ran away leaving me to fend off a family of rats. You’re a completely selfish human being and a and a physical and a moral coward.
7084,Penny,Oh Penny this is Dr. Plimpton a leading expert on quantum cosmology. Dr. Plimpton Penny is a waitress who doesn’t understand the role gasoline plays in the internal combustion engine.
7085,Sheldon,Just tell her I can’t come.
7086,Raj,Like a hero.
7087,Leonard,Come on Sheldon we’ve hardly shown him anything.
7088,Sheldon,Now just click on the enchanted boots to put them on.
7089,Sheldon,Not really. But I’m mad at him too so lemon bars it is.
7090,Sheldon,And reverse the spin on the antiproton and gamma becomes alpha multiplied by a matrix of negative I comma zero and there we have it. Conclusive proof that I am absolutely worthless after nine o’clock.
7091,Raj,You know what? You’re my best friend and she’s in a bad marriage. I give you my blessing.
7092,Leonard,Sheldon.
7093,Penny,Are you sure?
7094,Howard,Did the listing actually say miniature?
7095,Raj,I said no questions.
7096,Sheldon,Actually I have your signature on a roommate agreement that says you do.
7097,Howard,You’re kidding right?
7098,Leonard,Are there any other honours I’ve gotten that I don’t know about? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it?
7099,Sheldon,I wouldn’t say amazing. At best it’s a modest leap forward from the basic technology that gave us Country Bear Jamboree.
7100,Penny,You keep saying you’re on my side but you don’t act like it.
7101,Leonard,Mm this one comes with music and flowers. Oh they even stream the whole thing live on the Internet.
7102,Sheldon,Good perfect timing.
7103,Sheldon,He is a born showman.
7104,Howard,Oh. I always thought if I had a white name it would be Gavin.
7105,Sheldon,And it was literally the moment you walked out the door. But I see the type of personal revelations you’re going for. Okay here’s one I thought I’d take to the grave.
7106,Leonard,The poor guy on the bike. I had a nice time.
7107,Sheldon,A doctor? Well I hope you’re not contagious. I’ve got a weekend in the telescope room I’ve been excited about for almost three minutes.
7108,Penny,I don’t know; we shouldn’t worry her if it’s nothing.
7109,Penny,You know Sheldon Howard Raj who all’s coming?
7110,Sheldon,Great. Now I’m gonna have that song in my head all day.
7111,Leonard,Yes it would.
7112,Sheldon,He’s in the laundry room now. Now would be a good time.
7113,Howard,You were supposed to keep that to yourself.
7114,Penny,I also know your voice gets higher when you’re lying.
7115,Howard,You could try saying that without smiling.
7116,Sheldon,Exactly what 1970s television crime dramas have taught us. You give us the helium first.
7118,Sheldon,FYI I was defrosting a steak in there.
7119,Howard,Ah really? Thank you. Fate has given me a rare second chance and I swear to Vishnu I’m not gonna blow it. Or normal words followed by a charming smile.
7121,Howard,Then she’s going to have to convince your mother to let you go into space.
7122,Penny,Doesn’t it?
7124,Sheldon,Are you suggesting the work of a neurobiologist like Babinski could ever rise to the significance of a physicist like Clarke-Maxwell or Dirac?
7125,Sheldon,Excellent. If the yogurt works I bought some delightful scented candles.
7126,Howard,Don’t feel bad Leonard negative results are still results.
7127,Sheldon,They’re mint in box.
7128,Raj,The people from People.
7129,Penny,You know this is wrong. Let’s put everything back. Here.
7130,Sheldon,They found the remote controlled cars.
7131,Leonard,Of course not. Why would they be? Why would I ask? Why am I rambling? Why don’t you stop me?
7132,Leonard,In what universe is that a present?
7133,Leonard,Well then start throwing grenades.
7134,Leonard,Thanks.
7135,Sheldon,Well actually the risk of throat cutting is very low. On the other hand severe string burn is a real and ever-Present danger.
7136,Leonard,Yeah good for me. I’ll never have sex again.  I was wrong. See ya.
7137,Penny,I’m sorry. What can I do?
7138,Sheldon,Oh we’ll make the puzzles extremely challenging to eliminate unworthy candidates.
7139,Raj,Holy crap!  Holy crap!
7140,Sheldon,We’d have to take your car.
7142,Sheldon,Despite recent events I do consider our experiment in cohabitation to have been positive.
7143,Sheldon,Maybe there’s a third option.
7144,Howard,No if I buy those I just go through them like candy.
7145,Penny,Well good for you.
7146,Leonard,Come here. Tell you a secret?
7147,Leonard,So you’re actually okay with invading your friend’s privacy?
7148,Penny,Wow. Okay. Well um how about this? Maybe while you’re still in town Leonard and I could have another small ceremony. You know if you’re interested.
7149,Howard,Great. And?
7150,Sheldon,Well my existence is a continuum so I’ve been what I am at each point in the implied time period.
7151,Howard,Why do you have a parking spot? You don’t have a car. You don’t even drive.
7152,Leonard,Sheldon you’re being ridiculous.
7153,Sheldon,Hello Wil Wheaton.
7154,Raj,When did you learn how to pick locks?
7155,Howard,Then put on a sweater.
7156,Leonard,I know. Food fight. I’ll keep thinking.
7157,Sheldon,Or maybe she wants to be friends and he wants something more.
7158,Sheldon,Are you saying that you think a celebration pie is even remotely comparable to a Nobel Prize?
7159,Penny,You have to we all have to be there at the same time to yell “surprise!”
7160,Leonard,Will you stop with that already?
7161,Penny,The problem isn’t what’s on the inside. It’s the creepy candy coating.
7162,Sheldon,Good Lord. Padawan’s the student not the teacher.
7163,Sheldon,Oh that would be good! Sawing hammering eating out of a lunch pail as my working-class fellows and I sit perched precariously on a girder high above the metropolis.
7164,Leonard,She’d need some kind of industrial cooling system.
7165,Sheldon,If you weren’t my friend there’d be a hole in my life.
7166,Leonard,Mm-hmm. For two of us it’s in the right direction.
7167,Leonard,Oh to be honest I don’t think it’s going to work out.
7168,Raj,Yeah but he doesn’t mean it.
7169,Howard,I don’t think that’s what you want at all.
7170,Penny,Are you gonna want to order food?
7171,Leonard,Behold?
7172,Sheldon,Yes. Look this over and tell me what’s unclear to you.
7173,Leonard,Us guys?
7174,Penny,That believe it or not is my prom dress.
7175,Penny,Oh my God.
7176,Howard,Are you sure?
7177,Sheldon,Comforting is a part of leadership. It’s not a part I care for but such is my burden.
7178,Howard,Well he’s not doing twenty-minute abs because if he were he would have way better abs. Can you hear anything?
7179,Sheldon,May I point out that for eight long months I suffered in silence as your female companion filled our apartment with her off-key country music caterwauling the unappetizing spectacle of her grinding a pumice stone against her calloused feet in our living room and night after night of uninformative TV documentaries about the Jersey Shore.
7180,Sheldon,Hmm. Eat one of your Luna bars. Very often when women think they’re angry they’re really just hungry.
7181,Leonard,You remember Sheldon and Raj and Howard.
7182,Sheldon,Ah! A vintage mint in box 1975 Mego Star Trek transporter with real transporter action. Hot-darn!
7183,Leonard,To… carve the… okay I’ll see you six thirty.
7184,Raj,Oh not really just hang out.
7185,Sheldon,Darn! She found me!
7186,Raj,Papa please don’t start.
7187,Sheldon,Are you Todd Zarnecki?
7188,Leonard,You made fun of us. Said it was stupid.
7189,Penny,Not really. My shirt was soaking wet. I got like the biggest tip of my life.
7190,Penny,Yeah.
7191,Leonard,Well a goof or not you’re actually married. You need to get this taken care of.
7192,Penny,Did I miss it?
7193,Sheldon,Screwed.
7194,Leonard,How many times are you gonna tell me? What’s with you?
7195,Leonard,Right.
7196,Raj,I’d like to back you up but it sounds like it was pretty precious.
7197,Raj,Can you believe how pushy she is?
7198,Raj,All right.
7199,Raj,It’s a little more bleak than I thought.
7200,Penny,Oh you think coffee means coffee that is so sweet. Come on I think I have decaf.
7201,Leonard,He offered me a fair price for the whole collection.
7202,Penny,‘Cause I already know what he’ll say. Wah wah wah you shouldn’t do it.
7203,Penny,I don’t understand exactly how did he get any friends in the first place?
7204,Sheldon,I should’ve warned you one has to navigate a labyrinth of social nonsense before one can be fed here.
7205,Leonard,Sheldon he’s just practising for his cousin’s birthday party.
7206,Leonard,Great.
7207,Raj,That’s just Amy.
7208,Raj,I don’t think we’re going to do that.
7209,Leonard,A solar system. Uh uh uh uh um unidentified flying liverwurst? I don’t…
7210,Sheldon,I’m getting dizzy.
7211,Penny,Well what’s wrong with that?
7212,Sheldon,Wait. What?
7213,Leonard,You okay?
7214,Sheldon,Gladly. Can we storm out?
7215,Penny,Wait what the hell’s going on with Leonard and Alex?
7216,Penny,Pretend he’s that TSA agent. Come on.
7217,Howard,Holy crap are we nerdy.
7218,Howard,So walk home.
7219,Sheldon,It’s called parallel play.
7220,Sheldon,Well to celebrate this reconciliation let’s all share a milk shake. Uh Penny you’ll need a straw.
7221,Howard,As a matter of fact I did. I’ve spent so many years living in fear saying no to new experiences but from now on I’m gonna say yes yes to love yes to adventure yes to life. Whatever it may be the answer’s going to be yes.
7222,Leonard,No but I was awake all night.
7223,Howard,Easy. Sleeping with Penny.
7224,Leonard,Yeah.
7225,Raj,Ooh! Girls’ night girls’ night! Ooh! Ooh!
7226,Penny,Great.
7227,Howard,No I got it.
7228,Sheldon,Yes?
7229,Leonard,I’d love it if my dad could come.
7230,Sheldon,Oh no.
7231,Leonard,I heard of ’em. Didn’t know they were a band. Sheldon she’s gone. You can turn off the blender.
7232,Penny,Huh.
7233,Raj,Really? The only thing I’ve learned in the last two hours is that American men love drinking beer pee too often and have trouble getting erections.
7234,Leonard,Ah I also made oatmeal.
7235,Howard,This is all your fault I should’ve listened to Mun-Mun because I’ve been playing with a cobra and her name is Penny. Why are you so cruel? Do you enjoy my pain?
7236,Sheldon,All right let me show you some of the features of the room. First windows. Conventional. Open closed open closed halfway open or halfway closed depending on your philosophical bent. Over here is my comic book collection. Feel free to browse. There’s a box of disposable reading gloves on the night stand.
7237,Leonard,I’m starting to get a sense of it. Don’t worry. I’ll take you to the dentist tomorrow.
7238,Sheldon,Big boy!  Someone touched my board. Oh God my board. Leonard! Leonard!
7239,Penny,Wait wait wait guys just hang on.
7240,Howard,I’m hammered.
7241,Leonard,Hey.  Oh no.
7242,Leonard,Was that a flask?
7243,Sheldon,Did you know that Leonard?
7244,Penny,Talk about what?
7245,Sheldon,All get vasectomies so this doesn’t happen to us?
7246,Penny,What? Are you kidding? We’re not hanging it.
7247,Howard,It was a tutorial. And yes I’m happy to keep Sheldon company.
7248,Sheldon,Or maybe she doesn’t. Let’s find out.
7249,Howard,Totally guys are the worst. I mean look at me. I let Emily make me a frittata and I kept the leftovers in Claire’s fridge that night. I’m such a dog.
7250,Howard,Dude my accent is brilliant.  Hey my snow-white American friends let’s put some cow meat on the barbecue and eat it until we’re all obese.
7251,Sheldon,My primary concern with being granted tenure is living with an insanely jealous roommate after the fact. I might need to sleep with a gun under my pillow. Or a chainsaw.
7253,Sheldon,Leonard i’ve been meaning to ask you what size shoe do you wear?
7254,Penny,Uh Sheldon I didn’t see your present.
7255,Leonard,Come on everyone to the hospital.
7256,Leonard,Okay good night.
7257,Leonard,Yeah toddlers do that.
7258,Raj,Oh come on I brought you one too.
7259,Penny,Oh see?
7260,Sheldon,Okay that’s it I don’t know how but she is cheating. No-one can be that attractive and be this skilled at a video game.
7261,Leonard,Penny.
7262,Sheldon,Oh there you are. Just so you know I was up all night but I have finally completed the Penny-specific section of the new roommate agreement.
7263,Raj,How could you do that to me? You know I’ve been working it with Alex for weeks.
7264,Sheldon,No that’s not fair either.
7265,Sheldon,Howard did you want your clothes arranged seasonally or by colour?
7267,Howard,Roger Abbott Roger Abbott Roger Abbott. Oh my God Leonard I know he’s dead but try it. It’s fun. Roger Abbott Roger Abbott.
7269,Leonard,You mean my cello?
7270,Sheldon, Leonard.
7271,Howard,I’m sorry that’s ambiguous. Is it five minutes apart starting at the top of the hour or five minutes apart starting with the first contraction so essentially like 65 minutes?
7272,Leonard,Actually science is my lady.
7273,Leonard,Yeah well not necessary. We broke up again.
7274,Sheldon,You’re tying my hands here.
7275,Sheldon,And then declaring the party a fiasco and storming out leaving him humiliated in front of his guests. Love it.
7276,Howard,Sorry. Better?
7277,Leonard,What’s the big deal?
7278,Sheldon,Well that would raise a number of problems. We’re colleagues. I’m currently in a relation… Excuse me a moment.
7279,Penny,Problem?
7280,Leonard,I can’t believe they kicked you out.
7281,Leonard,I said stay. I’m going to work. Do not follow me.
7282,Leonard,Hey.
7283,Sheldon,You know how when you’re sick you’re allowed to be cranky and say whatever you want and other people’s feelings don’t matter?
7284,Sheldon,Excuse me. I have to break up with my girlfriend.
7285,Sheldon,It’s true. In 1982 Wil played the voice of Martin the mouse in The Secret of NIMH. You moved me.
7286,Howard,If you were having Sheldon’s baby would you really want him in the room?
7287,Leonard,I don’t know what that means.
7288,Howard,I think you made that very clear.
7289,Leonard,So in conclusion the data show that at temperatures approaching absolute zero the moment of inertia changes and the solid becomes a super-solid which clearly appears to be a previously unknown state of matter.  Are there any questions?
7290,Leonard,That is a lovely story um are we going to do anything about Sheldon?
7291,Leonard,Will you relax? I’ll get it in a minute. Hey how was work?
7292,Penny,Oh so there’s no job?
7293,Raj,You know guys when facing disappointment Eat Pray Love teaches us–
7294,Penny,You were okay with that?
7295,Sheldon,Your meme hypothesis does intrigue me. How might we examine this more closely?
7296,Howard,So how’s your apartment?
7297,Raj,Fine you drink it.
7298,Howard,Oh my God what happened?
7299,Sheldon,No.
7300,Sheldon,Ow. That was your fault.
7301,Raj,Well I’m a Hindu. My religion teaches that if we suffer in this life we are rewarded in the next. Three months at the North Pole with Sheldon and I’m reborn as a well-hung billionaire with wings!
7302,Penny,What do you mean?
7303,Sheldon,To comfort you of course. No that’s not going to work at all I’ll comfort you from over here. Leonard what you’re experiencing is a classic Jungian crisis in which the aging individual mourns the loss of the never-to-be realized ideal family unit.
7304,Penny,Ooh low-techie-techie. So what are you working on right now?
7305,Sheldon,My pants are missing I don’t remember anything. Penny this is your youth. What do I do?
7306,Penny,I can’t even believe this. You know maybe you should just go.
7307,Penny,Oh damn they cancelled my Visa. Oh yay a new MasterCard!
7308,Sheldon,But I said I’m sorry.
7309,Sheldon,I appreciate your interest in the apartment. I just need to ask you a few standard questions.
7310,Leonard,Ah!
7311,Howard,Well uh for one thing you have bigger emotional problems than I do and I find that very attractive in a woman. I I don’t know. I just I think you’re wonderful.
7312,Leonard,I’m going to invite her over. We’ll have a nice meal and chat.
7313,Penny,Knowing them they will.
7314,Howard,That’s Professor Wilkinson’s wife she’s like 80 years old.
7315,Leonard,Fine. With.
7316,Sheldon,Well you remember when you told me I talk in my sleep? Well it occurred to me that like most things I say it’s probably pure gold. So I started recording it all and now Alex gets to comb through eight hours of what I like to call Sheldon After Dark.
7317,Raj,We could go up to Big Bear and get a house on the lake.
7318,Leonard,Wait twice?
7319,Sheldon,I’m confused. I was given an understanding that you allow your friends time on the machine?
7320,Penny,Oh. Wow. Good for you. 
7321,Leonard,See what?
7322,Leonard,Do not adjust the dosage. You nailed it.
7323,Penny,What is the problem?
7324,Leonard,No our names are on the sign-in sheet.
7325,Sheldon,I’m no stranger to memetic epidemiology. At Johnson Elementary School the phrase Shelly Cooper’s a smelly pooper spread like wildfire.
7326,Howard,I can’t. I’m too sick. Go away.
7327,Penny,Okay well your friend and his mother are there we’re going.
7328,Raj,No.
7329,Sheldon,Double Stuf?
7330,Penny,Great.
7331,Leonard,Preach.
7332,Penny,Look I know you were just trying to help with your Star Wars thing. I didn’t mean to call it idiotic.
7333,Raj,No.
7334,Leonard,Just sit here.
7335,Raj,I really don’t get your problem with birds.
7336,Sheldon,Thank you. I assume you’d like to reopen our dialogue about the university forcing me to continue with string theory?
7337,Sheldon,Well when challenged monkeys generally assert their dominance through chasing assault and a stylized penile display. That’s a little outside my comfort zone.
7338,Raj,She’s tired that was funny.
7339,Howard,She was looking for a husband so she can appear to be straight. And you know it sounded crazy to me at first but I’m actually thinking about doing it.
7340,Leonard,Well what difference does it make? If you’re moving back to India we’re obviously breaking up.
7341,Howard,Well that wasn’t as entertaining as when he rents bowling shoes but it was right up there.
7342,Raj,Okay okay guys new back stories. Uh Penny and Leonard you two lovebirds are super successful and living in New York. Uh you’re an actress you’re a professor and you have three beautiful kids.
7343,Howard,Not me I’m a hundred percent honest in all of my relationships.
7344,Leonard,Wouldn’t you rather bring Sheldon?
7345,Sheldon,Yes he won’t let go of my comic book.
7346,Sheldon,Please.
7347,Sheldon,I’ll do what I can. But it’s not going to be easy because when I’m with Amy and our bathing suit areas mush together boy howdy is it magic
7348,Leonard,I’m not afraid of you any more Jimmy. Now get out!  Uh-oh.
7349,Sheldon,You’re thinking of the moving assembly line an understandable but not excusable mistake. No. The moving assembly line that was introduced by Henry Ford in 1908. That innovation is what made possible our modern consumer culture by enabling a low-unit cost for manufactured goods. I guess that isn’t one of the topics discussed on your Radiohead.
7350,Sheldon,No I do. You’re upset about Emily and you’re Indian. I need to make you chai tea. Now I have all the ingredients except cardamom seeds. Do you happen to have any on you?
7351,Howard,Ooh I don’t like where this is going.
7352,Leonard,Nice shot.
7353,Sheldon,Done. You understand that moving forward we deal with the fact that my mother does not approve of you?
7354,Penny,Okay thanks anyway. Bye. Well his fiancée thought the idea of us working together was stupid. You were right I was wrong. Aren’t you gonna say anything?
7355,Sheldon,Hugh.
7356,Sheldon,Hello dear friends. And Dr. Hofstadter.
7357,Penny,I’d like a drink.
7358,Raj,And when you go to a Chinese restaurant he always gets the same fortune in his fortune cookie.
7359,Raj,Or possibly Durham North Carolina.
7360,Penny,Oh my God Howard. That’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever heard. And it came out of you.
7361,Sheldon,You know it might be fun. You love hummus.
7362,Sheldon,I don’t understand why I can’t talk at this meeting.
7363,Leonard,Come on Dennis I’ll show you the rec centre they’ve got nautilus equipment.
7364,Raj,You’re blowing this for me!
7365,Sheldon,Given that Saint Valentine was a third century Roman priest who was stoned and beheaded wouldn’t a more appropriate celebration of the evening be taking one’s steady gal to witness a brutal murder?
7366,Howard,Yeah that’s true. In fact they liked the song so much they retooled the whole script around it.
7367,Leonard,Penny you’re always welcome to stay with us.
7368,Raj,It’s okay.
7369,Leonard,Um hey Wil. What you doin’?
7370,Sheldon,Too bad your show is done. I kind of liked it. Leonard did you hear that? Oh the people are heartbroken. I can’t take this away from the world. Fun with Flags is back.
7371,Sheldon,I do like the X-Men.
7372,Leonard,Hey for the record Jimmy wasn’t the reason I wet the bed. That one has my mother written all over it.
7373,Howard,Oh get over yourself it’s a high-tech toilet.
7374,Leonard,What? Who would tell you something like that? Why would you tell her something like that?
7375,Sheldon,Check.
7376,Sheldon,The prospect of fried chicken.
7377,Penny,There. Done.
7378,Sheldon,Well that can’t be right.
7379,Leonard,Why?
7380,Leonard,Without.
7381,Howard,That’s exactly what she said. How do you know that?
7382,Raj,Nope. It’s exactly as lousy as advertised. Speaking of friends they have been asking to meet you. I was thinking maybe we could all hang out sometime?
7383,Leonard,‭Yeah. It’s a dinky little convention where they sell collectibles and get sad D-list celebrities to appear. Why?
7384,Raj,Well that wasn’t as entertaining as when he rents bowling shoes but it was right up there.
7385,Sheldon,That’s okay. Lactose intolerance is nothing to be embarrassed about.
7386,Penny,What exactly does that mean?
7387,Sheldon,Well I’m a lot less likely to see an Eastern Goldfinch or be murdered I’ll tell you that.
7388,Sheldon,Hello.
7389,Sheldon,I’ll sit over there it looks cleaner.
7390,Penny,Take us to a place we can waltz.
7391,Howard,I suppose you could have your android penis circumcised. But that’s something your Rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturers.
7392,Penny,Uh it’s okay sweetie good news Leonard’s home!
7393,Penny,So how was work today?
7394,Leonard,My God who’s the dork now? Thank you for wearing your flats.
7395,Leonard,Well do you really think I have a shot?
7396,Raj,Oh you’re welcome. Of course I couldn’t get you into the VIP section because you know that’s for VIPs and you guys are just you know Ps.
7397,Leonard,I’ve had it for a couple years not important. Penny will you marry me?
7398,Howard,I went and looked. It was a high and tiny window. She must have been very motivated.
7399,Raj,Hi. Hi. Yeah it’s Raj. Rajesh. We met at the comic book store.
7400,Penny,Hang on a second you picked up your mother? Her own legs are barely able to do that.
7401,Sheldon,Oh. Alright noted. Sorry.
7402,Leonard,Don’t say that to anyone.
7403,Penny,Well come on now she did kind of start it.
7404,Leonard,Boy you suck.
7405,Sheldon,I know. As hard as this is I have to move on. I can’t keep postulating multidimensional entities and get nothing in return. I have needs too.
7406,Leonard,Sheldon’s office? Is she lost?
7407,Sheldon,Keep it up?
7408,Sheldon,Shrewd.
7409,Raj,I was sleeping.
7410,Howard,Are you are you sure? Because this is the part of the night where I’ve said something stupid and the girl usually leaves.
7411,Raj,I don’t have plans which is why I booked time on the big telescope that night.
7412,Leonard,Okay Sheldon I am out of options. Video store owner Nursis Manookian has no next of kin.
7413,Raj,I don’t know.
7414,Sheldon,Drop axe. Brilliant.
7415,Leonard,Thank you.
7416,Penny,Well then why are you doing it?
7417,Sheldon,But I used science to construct the perfect joke.
7418,Raj,So Bernadette have you thought about how you’re going to redecorate this place?
7419,Sheldon,Well let’s see. We might consider Schrodinger’s Cat.
7420,Sheldon,I don’t know what colour lonely is.
7421,Penny,Oh you will. That’s why they give you the bucket. Uh-oh.
7422,Raj,What?
7423,Leonard,Wonder why she didn’t tell me.
7425,Raj,Not getting to see who wins at pigeon ping-pong comes to mind.
7426,Penny,Oh he’s all bent out of shape about having a roommate agreement meeting.
7427,Raj,I wonder if he’s listening to our music right now.
7428,Leonard,Okay… I just… I kind of…
7429,Leonard,Fine. Just get back under your blanket and I’ll drive you there.
7430,Raj,I was on the radio once. I called in to Fever 104 FM New Delhi and was the fourth person to say the phrase that pays “Fever 104 आज के नये अच्छे संगीत का घर.” That means “Fever 104 home of the really good current music.” It’s much catchier in Hindi.
7431,Leonard,Morning.
7432,Leonard,My last growth spurt.
7433,Leonard,Okay continuing our quest.
7434,Howard,Oh. Well that’s disappointing.
7435,Penny,Yeah you did. I felt so self-conscious I had to return them.
7436,Leonard,Come on buddy open up.
7437,Penny,Sheldon! What did you do?!
7438,Raj,Um kind of hit a bump. When I was honest and told Emily she wasn’t the only person I was seeing it went great. So I tried the same thing with Lucy.
7439,Penny,Um if if we want to order the soufflé we might want to get on that.
7440,Penny,I had a feeling we’d have a talk like this sooner or later. Are you finally getting fuzz in weird places?
7441,Sheldon,Will our hotel room be ready?
7442,Penny,Maybe Friday.
7444,Howard,Oh okay. Sounds like it’s me and you Sheldon. How about we sic some guppies on those puppies?
7445,Leonard,Again that doctor didn’t insult your honour. Just checked your prostate.
7446,Sheldon,What?
7447,Leonard,Uh Th that’s true. How late did we stay up last night?
7448,Penny,Oh it’s cute.
7449,Leonard,I’m hoping you can get an annulment. It’s just like it never happened.
7450,Raj,At least now I can focus all my energies on just one girl.
7451,Sheldon,Interesting. My mother and I have the same agreement about church.
7452,Penny,I don’t know the man on the box looks so happy.
7453,Sheldon,That’s what you did. I assumed as in a number of languages that the gesture was part of the phrase.
7454,Sheldon,I’m not going and you can’t make me.
7455,Sheldon,I don’t see anything.
7456,Sheldon,Of course.
7457,Leonard,Right.
7458,Howard,I don’t think that’s possible dude.
7460,Penny,I did?
7461,Leonard,My water. You’re drinking it.
7462,Sheldon,Don’t you ever speak to me again.
7463,Raj,Welcome.
7464,Leonard,Calm down we’ll make the movie.
7465,Leonard,Oh. That was really an asthma attack. I just sold it.
7466,Sheldon,Well oh it’s just a it’s a a golf ball that my brother threw at my head. You can still feel the dent. It’s right next to the hockey puck dent.
7467,Leonard,Yeah.
7468,Howard,Spending Valentine’s Day with Emily.
7469,Leonard,Okay feel better bye.  She doesn’t want to talk.
7470,Sheldon,Are you going to confront Penny?
7471,Raj,No no no no I think it just means it’s the kind of sauce that mobsters like.
7472,Sheldon,Huh. Yeah I always took it literally. That’s why I have never once moved my bowels in this or any restaurant. Hmm.
7473,Sheldon,Thank you. Have you chosen one to copulate with?
7474,Leonard,I’m not saying you have to ask my permission but you could have talked to me about it before you said it was okay.
7475,Raj,Simple subtraction will tell you it’s six better.
7476,Sheldon,Oh!
7477,Howard,Dude.
7478,Penny,Right.
7479,Sheldon,His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.
7480,Sheldon,Try and stop me.
7481,Howard,What the balls is forty-three?
7482,Raj,Well he could have been hit by a bus. You don’t know.
7483,Raj,Hey.
7485,Raj,Did he get superpowers?
7486,Sheldon,You’re asking a lot of questions Wil Wheaton. As a matter of idle curiosity which of your shrubberies do you feel would benefit from a thorough vomiting? Never mind I’ll choose.  You were so good in Stand by Me.
7487,Howard,Hey so what did you guys think of the new episode of Caprica last night?
7488,Sheldon,May I come in?
7489,Sheldon,Only you.
7490,Penny,Yeah that’ll slow it down.
7491,Leonard,Am I allowed to ask how the class is going?
7492,Leonard,Very comforting. Okay so what do I say to her?
7493,Penny,I can’t believe this. You realize I make more money than you?
7494,Raj,I do appreciate that.
7495,Sheldon,What else would I drink? Gasses? Solids? Ionised plasma?
7496,Leonard,What you doing?
7497,Raj,By the time I was born Voyager 1’s mission was supposed to be over. It had seen Jupiter and Saturn and all their moons but it kept going. When I left India for America I was never more scared in my life. I had no idea what lay ahead. Whenever I feel that way I think about how Voyager is still out there somewhere beyond our solar system going further than anyone ever thought it could. Don’t leave. You can do this.
7498,Leonard,What can we do that’s different?
7499,Sheldon,Here day one uh this was the seat I was going to sit in but didn’t because there were cracker crumbs on it. As it was first class I suspect Ritz. This is the train bathroom. This is the Imodium I took so I would never have to use the train bathroom.
7500,Howard,You have lost so much weight! That must have been difficult for you because you were so so fat! Do you remember?
7501,Sheldon,You know I have always thought that this couch would look fantastic on the curb in front of the building.
7502,Sheldon,I don’t see why that’s surprising. I excel at so many things. You’ve had my sourdough bread.
7503,Leonard,Yeah I can see how that would… a bunch of people?
7504,Penny,Oh sweetie it was the best speech I…
7507,Sheldon,Thank you. I’m gonna go next door and play with Leonard.
7508,Howard,With a woman you were chasing through a park? That’s not a shot that’s a felony. What’s worse it cost me my prized Patang fighting kite. Sheldon I don’t suppose there’s any chance you could give me my kite back?
7509,Leonard,Yes.
7510,Leonard,Then what can I do?
7512,Sheldon,My shirt is itchy and I wish I were dead.
7513,Sheldon,Well it’s hardly my business what you eat as long as it doesn’t crunch during the film and it’s Raisinets.
7514,Sheldon,Before I tell you perhaps I should soften the blow. You’re face is pleasingly symmetrical.
7515,Howard,So I read a study that says a man with a dog is three times more likely to get a woman’s phone number.
7516,Sheldon,Mai du lui tsa.
7517,Raj,If you weren’t screwing around with Sheldon’s assistant none of this would be happening.
7518,Sheldon,Do another one do another one.
7519,Sheldon,Oh yeah I’d have to say it’s the most exiting time in the history of the field.
7520,Sheldon,Oh look at you the little engineer that could.
7521,Raj,You’re a good son. I don’t know how you do it.
7522,Howard,I may be moving out soon. I think I found a place to live.
7523,Penny,Actually I think he’s onto something.
7524,Howard,He’s depressed because he’s pathetic and creepy and he can’t get girls.
7525,Penny,Are you trying to make small talk? Oh sweetie you really don’t have to.
7526,Raj,Hey uh thanks for keeping me company.
7527,Leonard,I have never been more attracted to a woman who sounds like a man in my life.
7528,Penny,Yeah well he brought a book okay? What’s yours?
7529,Raj,Well uh there was a time when I had a thing for Penny and I thought she was into me too because she got drunk and naked and climbed into bed with me. But apparently I misread those signals.
7530,Sheldon,To that point it occurs to me that we might have an opportunity to finally snare Best Group Costume if we shore up our weak link which is clearly Leonard as Superman.
7531,Sheldon,You whistled?
7532,Sheldon,My credibility may have been damaged…
7533,Sheldon,You aren’t you gonna come with me?
7534,Leonard,Forget about the bobcat.
7535,Leonard,Uh-huh I can already feel it working.
7536,Leonard,I was working with Dave Underhill.
7537,Sheldon,I don’t need to outrun him I just need to outrun you.
7538,Leonard,Oh. Cool. I’ve got a lawyer. And I’ve seen her naked.
7539,Leonard,Look even if it’s not him Amy’s probably going to date someone at some point.
7540,Penny,Well In that case do you mind giving me some advice?
7541,Sheldon,Oh none that I could see. I saw a man who loved flags almost as much as I do. I got goose bumps.
7542,Sheldon,I suppose we can stay up and talk.
7543,Penny,Don’t you quit on us!
7544,Sheldon,You’re so cute. I’m gonna go learn how to walk on stilts.
7545,Raj,Are you seriously going to deface your body just for the possibility you could have cheap sex with a strange girl you met in a bar?
7546,Leonard,Yeah so?
7547,Raj,Come on Sheldon!
7548,Penny,He didn’t know it till he was cuffed but yeah.
7549,Penny,Sure sure. Uh did you ever figure out who told?
7550,Leonard,Well have you considered telling her how you feel?
7551,Raj,Wow if he cracks that it’s a game changer guys. It’ll completely redefine our understanding of the physical universe.
7552,Sheldon,Oh I always enjoy that but I’m a little busy.
7553,Raj,Preach.
7554,Leonard,Long long night.
7555,Raj,Yes Mommy.
7556,Sheldon,Oh please. Look at you with your pouty bee-stung lips.
7557,Leonard,Well The point is if this got out it would destroy Howard and Raj’s friendship.
7558,Penny,Who’s the duchess?
7559,Sheldon,Oh okay well then calm down.
7560,Sheldon,That’s it. The Sheldon Cooper Girlfriend Challenge is officially live.
7561,Leonard,Do you think maybe it’s tight because you’re wearing long underwear?
7562,Penny,Of course she told me it’s the most interesting thing that’s ever happened to her in her entire life.
7563,Sheldon,You know the more I think about it the mobster sauce couldn’t possibly contain chunks of mobster.
7564,Sheldon,You gave Leonard somewhere to go. Thanks to you Amy’s out buying his and hers bath towels. Like I’d ever dry myself with something that has a possessive pronoun on it.
7565,Sheldon,Where are we going?
7566,Leonard,Okay. So we went out saw a movie met some nice people said horrible things about each other in public all in all a pretty magical night.
7567,Sheldon,I do see what you’re saying. That helps.
7568,Leonard,No no no you don’t get it um Howard enable public access.
7569,Raj,Just for the record when you enter five million three hundred eighteen thousand and eight in a calculator upside-down it spells boobies.
7571,Howard,And it only took 28 minutes.
7572,Howard,I almost met someone last night but I blew it. I was walking Cinnamon and this girl introduced herself but she was so cute I panicked and said wouldn’t it be easier if instead of talking we could just sniff each other’s butts?
7573,Sheldon,Don’t know.
7574,Sheldon,Oh no not at all. No we uh found a place online that uh repurposes diamond drill bits.
7575,Sheldon,I love that one.
7576,Leonard,S’mores huh? Good for you.
7577,Howard,Okay okay the point is that we accept your apology.
7578,Sheldon,It’s my office.
7579,Sheldon,Okay thanks. Just throw it out. Speaking of occupants I’m given to understand Raj will be moving into my old room.
7580,Howard,He never touched my telescope.
7581,Raj,How are you doing with…
7582,Sheldon,Ow. We didn’t vote!
7583,Raj,Please my pleasure.
7584,Raj,If you would just use the bucket you’d be so much more comfortable.
7585,Raj,No thank you. I’m fine.
7586,Leonard,She didn’t dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.
7587,Howard,Congratulations you are the proud owner of a miniature time machine.
7588,Raj,But remember our agreement? You can joke about murdering people but you have to say just kidding.
7589,Sheldon,Go apologize to Penny.
7591,Howard,Wow. You’re even prettier than Penny said. I can’t believe a girl like you doesn’t have a boyfriend.
7592,Howard,I’m sad.
7593,Howard,Dude this is this is brutal.
7594,Penny,Your love confuses me.
7595,Leonard,Oh crap!
7596,Penny,Okay.  Wait wait where are you going?
7597,Sheldon,Just one more bite.
7598,Howard,You’re right let’s talk again in a few days.
7599,Sheldon,I wasn’t talking to you.
7600,Sheldon,One of my best don’t you think?
7601,Penny,But you’re curious about aluminium cans? You’re a weird little guy.
7602,Leonard,I don’t think the lever’s working.
7603,Raj,Listen uh there’s something I want to talk to you about. I I wasn’t ready until now but I think it’s time.
7604,Leonard,Why did you need a belt?
7605,Sheldon,Did you let Wil Wheaton get in your head?
7606,Howard,What about that little cup they give you?
7607,Howard,Why me?
7608,Penny,No you’re totally right. She could be skinny ’cause she’s dying.
7609,Penny,Well aren’t you sweet?
7610,Sheldon,Hello.
7611,Penny,And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?
7612,Sheldon,There are no do-overs in Wii bowling.
7613,Penny,Not a chance.
7614,Sheldon,I don’t understand. You were happy to do this when I hired you. Why why are you upset with me now?
7615,Penny,I can’t help it. But look I figured I could sit around and feel insecure or I could do something about it. So I got a course catalogue at school and looked at some of the science classes.
7616,Leonard,Hey you got Snoopy out. Can I have a snowcone?
7617,Raj,How could you send her away?
7618,Sheldon,I’m glad I told you about the storage unit.
7619,Raj,Cheers.
7620,Penny,Oh sweetie it’s okay. I don’t want tea.
7621,Leonard,You know ’cause ’cause a lot of people lose their virginity on prom night.
7622,Sheldon,Who was he?
7623,Leonard,He won’t say. He just smiles and eats macaroons out of his bat jar.
7624,Sheldon,Welcome to the building.
7625,Sheldon,In the past you’ve come to me when I’m struggling with a dilemma.
7627,Sheldon,Hello.
7628,Leonard,Because I’m Frodo.
7629,Penny,Well now I can’t blow this thing off without being a bitch.
7630,Howard,What? This is not a problem okay? If you don’t want to know I don’t have to tell you.
7631,Leonard,Raj is probably right. You should get someone to give you some pointers.
7632,Leonard,Come on you guys let it go.
7633,Sheldon,Well until they invent nose condoms I’m not finding out.
7634,Leonard,You’re nitpicking.
7636,Howard,So where’s your roommate tonight?
7637,Leonard,Do you mind if I spend the weekend playing video games with the guys?
7638,Penny,I know right? Okay let’s see what else? Um that’s about it. That’s the story of Penny.
7639,Raj,Because instead of being in the telescope room I was busy making you guys home made jam for the holidays.
7640,Leonard,We’re heading out for some kite fighting.
7641,Penny,Okay look don’t think of it as dating a girlfriend. Think of it as uh getting to know the future mother of your child.
7642,Howard,No it’s okay. I don’t have to go. I’m happy just to guide you and your ladies to suitable entertainment choices. I’m a walking brown Yelp.com.
7643,Sheldon,Oh. Uh no no no thank you.
7644,Penny,Howard never let her go.
7645,Penny,Okay but you may feel some discomfort.
7646,Sheldon,My mother was right. Hell is real.
7647,Leonard,I’m going out for a while.
7648,Sheldon,And you know why? ‘Cause you’re a man. The champagne of genders.
7649,Howard,Well you know whenever you and I would try to hit on women in bars and they’d blow us off and then we’d tell each other they were probably gay. It’s like that. Except this time it’s true.
7650,Penny,Okay come on I don’t even have my own house I’m going to build one for someone else?
7651,Sheldon,In this context for me could mean with me.
7652,Howard,He is kind of a weirdo. Maybe he’s got Leonard Nimoy chained up in there. Or Bill Gates. Or Stephen Hawking.
7653,Leonard,Oh good.
7654,Leonard,Say what you will about the healthcare system in this country but when they’re afraid of lawsuits they sure test everything.
7655,Leonard,Why?
7656,Howard,Ooh dark matter. We better bring a flashlight. I was making a joke.
7657,Leonard,Well Sheldon it took me all morning but I found the owner of the video store. And I am happy to report that he died peacefully in his sleep drunk at the bottom of a pool. Anyway there is no one to return the DVD to so this issue is resolved. Ah! And I’d just like to point out that even though the sweater was uncomfortable I didn’t use it as an excuse to antagonize everyone around me.
7658,Leonard,Sheldon I’ve got some bad news.
7659,Raj,Hey don’t talk to her like that. She’s a lady.
7660,Leonard,We’re not doing names now. Howard?
7661,Howard,Thanks Barry. Siri remind me Friday morning to make my famous popovers.
7662,Sheldon,Never.
7663,Penny,Oh thank you Beverly.
7664,Raj,I think you’re both cute.
7665,Leonard,Yes.
7666,Raj,Oh boy! Tator tots and a party invitation? What a great day!
7667,Howard,There’s been a problem with an experiment. A bird got into the clean room.
7668,Howard,I may not be liking this game so much.
7669,Raj,No she didn’t.
7670,Sheldon,We haven’t established that I’m wrong once.
7671,Sheldon,You’re welcome. Point of inquiry why did you put your car key in the door lock?
7672,Howard,Kripke? Is that you?
7673,Sheldon,You don’t have to leave.
7674,Sheldon,Leonard I assumed you knew. The ranking of relationships in our circle by quality is me and Amy Howard and Bernadette Raj and his girlfriend Penny and Chardonnay Penny and you.
7675,Sheldon,Sorry I have company.
7676,Sheldon,I believe that uh we just killed a dragon. While the others pillage the corpse I lead you to a secluded area where I attempt to remove your leather armour.  It comes off.
7677,Leonard,Come on it’s Christmas just give me this one.
7678,Sheldon,Now I’m thinking about Jell-O.
7679,Leonard,I know you’re joking but I’d be okay with that.
7680,Sheldon,When I was six they told me Batman was coming to my party. I waited by the door for hours. Closest thing to Batman I saw was when a robin flew into the window.
7681,Raj,Bad news the Nigerian prince may be a fraud.
7682,Howard,Hey Stuart you got anything going on for Valentine’s Day?
7683,Sheldon,Engineering. Where the noble semi-skilled labourers execute the vision of those who think and dream. Hello oompah-loompahs of science.
7684,Raj,Uh maybe it’ll come up when I apply for citizenship. Oh crap what if it comes up when I apply for citizenship?
7685,Penny,Well have fun tonight.
7686,Penny,Okay. Oh it’s a bowling alley.
7687,Sheldon,Do you see me drinking lemonade?
7688,Sheldon,Given the reaction to my costume this party is a scathing indictment of the American education system.
7689,Howard,Come and get it.
7690,Raj,Okay uh will I get to see you tomorrow?
7691,Penny,Oh the poor guy’s so lonely. We should set him up with someone.
7692,Sheldon,Well no. It’s not cool. If there were reserved seating and we all had tickets that would be fine. But this line is first-come first-served. Not show up tardy and nevertheless be first served. Right here.
7693,Sheldon,Of course I could.
7694,Howard,So are you worried because he’s replacing you as a son or are you worried because he’s becoming her lover?
7695,Sheldon,I had no choice he cried in front of her.
7696,Sheldon,Yes.
7697,Leonard,Well I think I came up with a pretty good solution.
7698,Leonard,You get that these are personalised action figures.
7699,Penny,Okay moving on. Now who are these guys at Disney World?
7700,Sheldon,Not quite accurate. The Macy’s balloons are filled with helium whereas Leonard produces copious amounts of methane.
7701,Sheldon,I am.
7703,Howard,Don’t flatter yourself dude. I want to go out and meet a woman.
7704,Leonard,Isn’t that terrific? He is such a good friend. You know what the best thing about friends is?
7705,Howard,Huh. That is so strange. Human Resources wants to talk to me tomorrow.  Could you stop licking your ass for two minutes? I have a problem here.
7706,Penny,Could you two really have some sort of super-intelligent child?
7707,Leonard,You did?
7708,Sheldon,It’s a good thing you’re cute.
7709,Howard,It’s open.
7710,Leonard,Like what?
7711,Penny,Let’s go.
7712,Leonard,You and I never just hang out like this. Why is that?
7713,Leonard,Why?
7714,Leonard,Sheldon what are you doing?
7715,Penny,You really think there’s some kind of scientific discovery in here?
7716,Leonard,Still get in.
7717,Leonard,And no one told me?
7718,Penny,That’s no reason to back out. You know I once got a pretty big honour in high school and I was terrified about appearing in front of a big crowd but I went through with it and you know what? The world looked pretty darn good sitting on a haystack in the back of a Ford F-150 as a member of the Corn Queen’s court.
7719,Raj,Maybe. Why not? Who do I have in my life to watch my figure for?
7720,Sheldon,Leonard.
7721,Penny,Oh hey.
7722,Raj,Why not?
7723,Sheldon,I imagine there aren’t many kosher corn-huskers.
7724,Penny,Okay really? So you’d be fine if I went back to acting and waiting tables again?
7725,Sheldon,Well but what kind of scientists would we be drawing a conclusion after only 12 hours of data?
7726,Raj,Well anyway I’ll leave you to your girls’ night.
7727,Penny,Okay and after all that you just moved in?
7728,Sheldon,Laminate the core material.
7729,Sheldon,Better. It has a gold crown. You see the king wondered how much gold was in it and charged Archimedes with coming up with the solution. Because the crown was irregularly shaped there was no way to mathematically determine its volume. But while bathing Archimedes realized he could immerse the crown and measure the amount the water rose.
7730,Raj,Oh I’m gonna do a pre-cry before I go in there. Really dry myself out.
7731,Howard,Mmm. Amy that pudding was delicious.
7732,Howard,What?
7733,Howard,Even drunk he’s still smarter than all of us.
7734,Raj,Okay how about this. Even Spock had a date once every seven years.
7735,Howard,You know if I made more money I could take time off from work and give pretty girls submarine rides.
7736,Raj,Potty is innocent. Potty is adorable.
7737,Raj,I’d like to weigh in here. No.
7738,Sheldon,Oh dear Lord yes yes oh yes! Amy I’ve never been touched like this before! Oh! Oh my hands are magic!
7739,Penny,That sounds so great. But I have a little more studying to do.
7740,Sheldon,Oh very much so. Listen to this. This is from two days ago. Hi. Hope you’re having a good day. Who has time for this constant sexting?
7741,Leonard,No there was no spat.
7742,Leonard,What’s in the bag?
7743,Penny,Come on everybody has a deal.
7744,Sheldon,No. I decline to provide one.
7745,Sheldon,Elbow macaroni with ground hamburger and tomato sauce.
7746,Howard,Really? Us gonna tell him?
7747,Leonard,Raj please let’s stay serious here. Superman’s body is Kryptonian therefore his sweat is Kryptonian.
7748,Raj,Hello-lo-lo.
7749,Penny,Oh. I was just kind of hoping you were drunk. Now we’re back live.
7751,Sheldon,Leonard as your friend I feel I should tell you something.
7752,Sheldon,Well done Dr. Koothrappali.
7753,Penny,Why not?
7755,Sheldon,Shh! Ramona’s sleeping on the couch.
7756,Sheldon,Thank you.
7757,Leonard,You know what I mean could you just give us a little privacy?
7758,Sheldon,All right. Let’s go to the comic book store.
7759,Leonard,Oh fun. I get to spend another night in front of our apartment dressed like one of the Village People.
7760,Penny,Sheldon’s churro on my shoes.
7761,Penny,Missy I’m going to go get my nails done. Do you want to come?
7762,Leonard,I don’t know. Because we don’t have a date?
7763,Sheldon,Hey isn’t that Professor Proton?
7764,Leonard,I don’t really go by Lenny but that’s okay. Um you remember Sheldon Howard and Raj.
7765,Sheldon,Leonard don’t be fooled. I’m from Texas Me-hi-co is Spanish for Mexico.
7766,Sheldon,It’s like you said you’re my girlfriend.
7767,Leonard,Turned to boom-boom.
7768,Sheldon,I’m getting worried.
7769,Sheldon,Hey uh Bernadette let’s test this theory. What do you think I’m feeling right now?
7770,Raj,I’m sure you were great.
7771,Raj,So?
7772,Penny,Yeah I’ve been thinking about it too.
7773,Howard,You’re just saying that.
7775,Sheldon,Oh thank goodness.
7776,Leonard,Excuse me if I were to give up at the first little hitch I never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang.
7777,Leonard,No no say it. Sing it. Rent a plane write it in the sky.
7778,Sheldon,No that can’t be it. And since you seem to have forgotten the reason we live together is we’re best friends. And I got your back Jack.
7779,Raj,Are you sure?
7780,Penny,Well I will still come to your meeting.
7782,Penny,Your arch enemy?
7783,Leonard,Watch me.
7784,Howard,Yeah I’m making a bunch of changes. This morning I fired my dog walker.
7785,Sheldon,Don’t take it personally it’s his pathology he can’t talk to women.
7786,Raj,I’ve been plenty of times. If I miss one it’s fine. I’m a big boy.
7787,Howard,I like green lantern I’m just saying it’s pretty lame that He can be defeated by the colour yellow.
7788,Penny,Yeah me too.
7789,Penny,Please Sheldon. I need you.
7790,Sheldon,How are you going to take notes without a notebook?
7791,Howard,Hey guys. Hey Penny. I really appreciate you helping me with this. I don’t know what to do.
7792,Raj,It was a classic western set in the post-Jurassic period and it changed my life.
7793,Leonard,This is it.
7794,Penny,Oh you’re welcome sweetie.
7795,Sheldon,I don’t know what Arctic expedition you guys were on but I thought it was a hoot and a half.
7796,Sheldon,I think so.
7797,Leonard,Oh God.
7798,Leonard,I tried to stop you.
7799,Leonard,You’re right it is simple. 
7800,Sheldon,You are overlooking the fact that we now know what we’re up against and we can modify Monte so that he’s prepared.
7801,Penny,Well I’ll have you guys know I turned down a part in a movie last week.
7803,Leonard,I’m going to the movies with Penny. I don’t want her to think that I think it’s a date.
7804,Leonard,He just made that easier.
7805,Sheldon,And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes but on a more serious note it’s 813 and we’re still not playing Halo.
7806,Raj,To friendship.
7807,Penny,Nice to meet you too. Are you enjoying your stay?
7808,Raj,Okay that’s not so bad. You know what happened to the scientists that worked on the Manhattan Project? The government forced them to move to the desert. They had to live in secret and when Oppenheimer objected to what they made him do they destroyed his reputation.
7809,Leonard,How could you lose that?
7810,Penny,And go where?
7811,Raj,Why?
7812,Sheldon,Wait no that’s a false equivalency. More does not equal merry. If there were 2000 people in this apartment right now would we be celebrating? No we’d be suffocating.
7813,Sheldon,I think you’re gonna like a lot of things I have in store. For example in this world only the men get pregnant so your husband is home trying not to pee when he laughs.
7815,Sheldon,It was a map leading to the lost treasure of famous pirate One-Eyed Willy.
7816,Leonard,Well ho-hold on. What if the wizard casts a Helmet of Confusion spell on Billy the Kid’s cowboy hat?
7817,Leonard,Why don’t you just eat in your desk chair?
7818,Sheldon,Did I? Well that can’t be right. No one’s ever done that before. Except me because I just did it. Sheldon and his brain yeah. Sheldon and his brain yeah. Sheldon and his brain yeah. Sheldon and his brain yeah. Sheldon and his brain…
7819,Leonard,All the time.
7820,Sheldon,Said the hangman offering a noose.
7821,Sheldon,Why are you all smiling like crazy people?
7822,Leonard,Look I know he can be aggravating but what you have to remember is that he’s not doing it on purpose. It’s just how he is. But he’s also loyal and trustworthy and we have fun together.
7823,Penny,Okay.
7824,Sheldon,What emergency happened at the L.A. Zoo?
7825,Howard,Just until he gets back on his feet which are looking pretty good in the boots I bought him for his birthday.
7826,Raj,Are you Spock?
7827,Sheldon,Clogzilla. That’s pretty funny. I don’t think that’s gonna pass.
7828,Leonard,You’re kidding.
7829,Penny,That we’re engaged and have nothing in common and it scares me.
7830,Penny,Really? Because to me it seems like we’re about to get married and you’re trying to sabotage it.
7831,Leonard,She’s doing amazing. She can actually make a side effect like 10% chance of liver failure sound like a 90% chance of liver success.
7832,Leonard,You know what Sheldon take it. In fact you can have everything I really don’t care.
7834,Howard,Two words deaf chick. It doesn’t matter if I can’t talk because she can’t hear me.
7835,Howard,With my luck hepatitis
7836,Sheldon,Yeah the math is so inelegant. I’m not even sure it makes sense.
7837,Sheldon,Penny lied about graduating from community college because she is afraid she’s not smart enough for Leonard.
7838,Sheldon,You could have told her the truth.
7839,Howard,What is wrong with people? Why don’t they stop?
7840,Penny,Oh hon… Uh…  Soft kitty warm kitty…
7842,Leonard,Never mind what’s your announcement?
7843,Sheldon,According to the roommate agreement paragraph nine subsection B the right to bathroom privacy is suspended in the event of force majeure. And believe me I am experiencing a very majeure force.
7844,Leonard,No.
7845,Sheldon,That’s some smart talk from a guy who can’t even keep his face in focus. Where’s the bathroom?
7846,Howard,Well you must have someone in your family that’s a lawyer.
7847,Leonard,Okay a complete pass. First down New England. I think I’m starting to get this.
7848,Sheldon,Well statistically speaking…
7849,Penny,Sheldon just stop look the fight is over. Oh and FYI you never even heard of The Black Eyed Peas until you met me!
7850,Leonard,Okay. Well then it’s settled. Small indoor church wedding black-tie no butterflies.
7851,Penny,I don’t understand why doesn’t Howard just introduce you to the guy?
7852,Penny,No I know you’ll try but it’ll make you miserable which will make me miserable and I’m just gonna stay where I’m at for now.
7853,Sheldon,You see a dragon.
7854,Penny,Aristotle?
7855,Sheldon,Now I know how you felt getting mauled by that sex-crazed gorilla.
7856,Penny,Disgusting. Do not tell him.
7857,Sheldon,It was nice of her to show us playing dumb with an example.
7858,Howard,You don’t have to make me anything.
7859,Raj,What up guys?
7860,Leonard,That’s it. No more Thai food.
7861,Penny,Look it’s Stuart.
7862,Sheldon,Roughing it? Okay. Everything looks so big from down here. This must be how Leonard feels.
7863,Sheldon,Oh uh never have I ever put my foot in the ocean.
7865,Raj,Excuse me but I think you’re missing a big opportunity here.
7866,Raj,That is that is so good!
7867,Leonard,No no no I don’t want to.
7868,Sheldon,I believe I’ve made some progress on our ground rules.
7869,Leonard,Well then we’ll avoid Finkleday we’ll meet the new department head congratulate him shake his hand and go.
7870,Howard,Mm-hmm.
7871,Sheldon,No I need a new woman in my life to ignore so I can hyper-focus on my work again.
7872,Raj,Yeah well maybe the village was too busy checking out the local Montessori school for the new arrival.
7873,Leonard,We had that idea years ago. How come we never did anything with it?
7874,Leonard,He kind of does.
7875,Raj,Yes. Arlene. She wrote no way on both our cappuccinos.
7876,Sheldon,Eh why? My spot your spot what difference does it make?
7877,Leonard,I don’t want to play a game Sheldon.
7878,Leonard,Yes.
7879,Leonard,Why are you making it worse?
7880,Raj,Sheldon if you don’t like this stuff let’s just go next door and build her a bear.
7881,Sheldon,Well the American Midwest was mostly settled by Scandinavian and Germanic peoples who well they have a characteristic facial bone structure….
7882,Leonard,Your son seems to think we need to launch a pre-emptive strike on Burbank.
7883,Sheldon,Sheldon’s journal. Security system in place. However sleep continues to elude me. I’ve seen the underbelly of Pasadena this so-called City of Roses and it haunts me. Ah the injustice I lie here awake tormented while out there evil lurks probably playing Donkey Kong on my classic Nintendo.  Leonard and Penny.
7884,Leonard,Hey buddy. Good to hear your voice.
7885,Penny,You want some wine?
7886,Penny,Oh God Sheldon look I’m trying to understand but you’re going too fast. Can you just back up a little bit?
7887,Leonard,Hey I made French toast sticks.
7888,Sheldon,Why would I be jealous?
7889,Penny,Wow Sheldon I cannot believe you made up your own game.
7890,Leonard,All right this is one-on-one. First person to five wins the office. Any questions? Yes Sheldon?
7891,Penny,Raj if you need a place to stay of course you are welcome here.
7892,Sheldon,I can’t tell you.
7893,Howard,How you feeling?
7894,Raj,You don’t know that. Prison changes people.
7895,Leonard,Yeah?
7896,Sheldon,And the first woman you ever disappointed sexually. Ba-da-bazinga!
7897,Raj,Bye Cinnamon. Be a good girl.
7898,Leonard,Raj what’s going on?
7899,Raj,Leonard’s having astronomically inaccurate Star Trek sex with my sister.
7900,Penny,I drink my potion.
7901,Raj,Actually 2008 NQ sub 17 is a planetary body.
7902,Sheldon,How could you not find him?
7903,Raj,Okay so what it sounds like is what we want is a device that can deliver a message through not only sight but other senses as well.
7904,Leonard,Have you been outside in the rain with Sheldon?
7905,Sheldon,Oh they shot a lot of Star Trek episodes out there.
7906,Raj,Why would you do that? I specifically asked you not to do that.
7907,Penny,Oh pfft.
7908,Penny,Oh yeah. So Leonard tells me you’ve had a busy day.
7909,Sheldon,And is that lipstick on your cheek and neck.
7910,Leonard,Why? Because I’m a a smart decision?
7911,Howard,No jokes about the year I took ballet.
7912,Leonard,That beats the onesie I was gonna get them from baby Gap.
7913,Howard,And it’s done.
7914,Howard,Yeah but if he’s a sore loser maybe you’re better off without him.
7915,Sheldon,Leonard. Oh I’m so happy to see you.
7916,Penny,Well so are you. In fact you know what? We will never take you for granite. Did you get that? Granite? A little geology joke.
7917,Sheldon,2530 East Andy Devine Avenue
7918,Raj,Actually I was less the chatter than the chattee.
7919,Sheldon,Friday was that morning or afternoon?
7920,Leonard,It’s hard to talk with so much heavy chewing to do.
7921,Leonard,Of course. Good night.
7922,Sheldon,Hello.
7923,Sheldon,Yeah uh wait. Doesn’t he say something first? You know maybe in the voice of a beloved celebrity?
7924,Howard,Looks like someone else is going to have to be Wonder Woman.
7925,Raj,No thank you Mrs. Wolowitz. As it is I’m going to have to carry my stomach out of here like I’m a fireman rescuing an infant.
7926,Penny,All right who wants to go to my apartment and look at bridal magazines?
7927,Sheldon,Excuse me. I think you’re being a little rude.
7928,Sheldon,If you’re suggesting that that is the actual ring of power forged by Sauron in Mount Doom I look at you with an expression of exhaustion and ever so slight amusement.
7929,Sheldon,I do. You just happen to have caught me on a break. Oh let me see those cards.
7930,Sheldon,Oh I’m fine. It’s just some uh stomach medication for my trip. There’s the remote yet distinct possibility that I may end up in South America.
7931,Leonard,Hey Stuart what’s going on?
7932,Leonard,Really? Any chance you find them cold cruel and unsuitable for innocent little boys who just want to be happy?
7934,Penny,Okay can I get you after Friday when I get paid?
7935,Leonard,Hey Cinnamon guess who just did it human style.
7936,Raj,Well there’s a reception for my magazine article on Saturday.
7938,Howard,… but then it turns good again and that means it’s better than if it had never been bad for a while. I know that now thing’s aren’t good they are in fact very very bad but at least my heart is starting to heal. Slowly but surely. And oh how I cried. It was like a little uh thunderstorm on my face. But I’m a man okay? So I need to pull myself together pick up a pen and get it all out in my journal. I mean it’s not all bad right? Having my heart broken has allowed me to finally speak in front of you so you know a silver lining….
7939,Sheldon,I must say I was surprised you chose to spend our date night in your apartment. As I mentioned the Pasadena City Council is debating longer crosswalk times and later the LEGO store is having a midnight madness sale. You ask anyone that’s a hot date.
7940,Sheldon,Oh yes please. A pair of pants. And my toothbrush. Yeah and my mail. And a really good comeback for chicken legs because “I know you are but what am I?” was met with stony silence.
7941,Sheldon,Just a few.
7942,Sheldon,It’s actually Thai. You’re slipping.
7943,Sheldon,So does this fellow but he can’t without it burning like hot soup.
7944,Leonard,I’m sorry. Give him a hamburger.
7945,Penny,Shut up.
7946,Leonard,Exactly.
7947,Howard,If I don’t call her I won’t hear the end of it from my parents.
7948,Sheldon,Oh great now I work the controls I say all aboard. You sit quietly and watch.
7949,Raj,Kites ho!
7950,Sheldon,There being no objections…
7952,Leonard,Sure why not?
7953,Leonard,You mean kiss you now?
7954,Penny,We gotta get her to a vet right now.
7955,Sheldon,Don’t worry. As your tertiary friend I am prepared to step in and comfort you.
7956,Raj,Oh uh on the off chance that Bernadette doesn’t call back and apologize how do you feel about Mexican food for dinner tonight?
7957,Sheldon,So this is how it ends with cruel irony. Just as I make the commitment to preserving my body I am betrayed by my appendix a vestigial organ. Do you know the original purpose of the appendix Leonard?
7958,Penny,Of course it’s making me uncomfortable can’t you tell?
7959,Leonard,Amazon offers one-day rush.
7960,Leonard,The one with the little onions? Mmm.
7961,Leonard,I think it’ll be pretty clear. If not we’ll take a vote. Oh and also…
7962,Howard,Dude there’s so many cool things we could be doing tonight. Look. At the Glendale Galleria put on your best zoot suit it’s a salute to Swing music in the center court near Macy’s. 5pm to 9pm huh huh? A salute to zoot. Sounds like a hoot.
7963,Leonard,Why?
7964,Raj,Why yes I love to party. Party is my middle name. Or it would be if it weren’t Ramayan.
7965,Raj,Go online and look it up.
7966,Howard,Simple subtraction will tell you it’s six better.
7967,Raj,Look the problem with commencement speeches is that they’re boring. Ooh do you own a T-shirt cannon?
7968,Leonard,Sheldon can you grab me a water?
7969,Leonard,We must not be playing it right.
7970,Penny,Why don’t you just admit you only want to play this game because you always play it with Leonard and you miss him?
7971,Leonard,Howard artificial women are your department. You want to take this?
7972,Penny,No and no. Everything okay with you and Bernadette?
7973,Penny,Okay I’ll go to a hotel. Text me in the morning if you’re still alive.
7975,Leonard,If you had ripped jeans and a leather jacket you’d be like the toughest kid on the Disney Channel. So anything else planned for tonight?
7976,Sheldon,Cobbler. I’m still laughing.
7977,Raj,Penny I I miss her already.
7978,Sheldon,Why didn’t you stop me?
7979,Sheldon,Oh yes it’s Halo night. Let me just dry my tootsies.
7980,Penny,Sorry. Okay who wants syrup and who wants cinnamon sugar?
7981,Raj,I know you could ask Bernadette for a raise in your allowance.
7982,Penny,Yes yes look and now you have a photo to remember that heroic day.
7983,Raj,My name is Howard. I can make your hair into diamonds. My mom is morbidly obese. Everybody love me.
7984,Leonard,Don’t worry about it. You know there’s some guys over there. You should go talk to them.
7985,Howard,Penny?
7986,Penny,Wait I remember that. Hang on. You did it at our place?
7987,Howard,Here.
7988,Leonard,What do you mean you’re moving out? Why?
7989,Penny,Oh uh not much. We do have a chocolate key lime that’s moving pretty well.
7990,Sheldon,But I occupy the moral high ground.
7991,Leonard,No you’re not. You’re here to see if I get my underwear pulled over my head.
7992,Leonard,Have you guys heard about this research team that’s trying to transgenically manipulate chicken DNA to create some sort of chicken dinosaur?
7993,Sheldon,Well now I have to correct you. As a bit of an elephant seal buff the more accurate comparison would be when two mother seals actively seek to nourish the same pup. So I believe the term you’re looking for is a double mother suckler.
7994,Sheldon,Cholera is water-borne. You’re mocking me.
7995,Penny,Oh the flu I guess.
7996,Raj,Just bust a move
7997,Howard,No. I haven’t played the race card yet.
7998,Sheldon,If I’m not taking credit for our work then nobody is.
7999,Leonard,I’m so proud of you.
8000,Penny,Sure. I did the one with the frogs.
8001,Sheldon,Oh. All right. Um. I should probably tell you something about this gift.
8002,Howard,So how are you gonna return the DVD if the store went out of business?
8003,Leonard,Do I have to?
8004,Penny,Oh. Penny. Nice to meet you.
8005,Sheldon,Oh right yes I could have stayed behind and watched Wolowitz try to hit on Penny in Russian Arabic and Farsi. Why can’t she get her own TV.
8006,Leonard,Hey.
8007,Howard,Yeah great.
8008,Leonard,Let’s go check to see if the university has any helium in reserve.
8009,Sheldon,They had a make your own sundae bar. Ooh that was a night to remember. Do you know on the one trip I just had a bowl of nuts.
8010,Penny,It was over a bowling alley.
8011,Leonard,What did you have in mind?
8012,Penny,Sure.
8013,Penny,Yeah. I’ve got eight pounds of salmon that’s about to go bad. Do you know how to cook it?
8014,Penny,All right well I’ll see you later.
8015,Sheldon,Yeah I know. Forever. Who would have believed these things would happen to us?
8016,Sheldon,Will you be serving cranberry jelly or cranberry sauce?
8017,Raj,Sheldon.
8018,Penny,Un-freakin’ believable.
8019,Penny,Hmm. That’s too bad. We could have spent New Year’s Eve waiting for the ball to drop.
8020,Sheldon,He does? Who is it?
8021,Sheldon,So Wil what do you have for us first?
8022,Leonard,I don’t know I kind of promised Howard.
8023,Leonard,I don’t want to.
8024,Sheldon,And you don’t wish to alarm me with any more loud noises very thoughtful. Warm milk Penny?
8025,Howard,Yeah. Come on I’ll give you a ride.
8026,Sheldon,How can she remember all those lines but as a waitress she can’t remember no tomato on my hamburger?
8027,Sheldon,Shedding the yoke of my oppressors you blind sad little man.
8028,Leonard,Very funny.
8029,Raj,At least Leonard Howard and I would have always been friends.
8030,Penny,You know what? I’m sorry. It’s stupid to fight over money.
8031,Penny,Hey.
8032,Raj,Hey Penny. Happy Star Wars Day.
8033,Leonard,Why don’t I just start? Sometimes people have trouble accepting accolades if on a subconscious level they don’t feel they deserve them. Do you think maybe that’s what’s happening here?
8034,Howard,But wouldn’t Man-Batman just be a Batman that was bitten by a radioactive man?
8035,Leonard,How is that going to help them?
8036,Sheldon,Oh that part wasn’t so bad. I didn’t like them either. But then I’d inevitably spend the whole day being tortured by my sister’s friends.
8037,Raj,You’re right. Let’s talk about your grandmother.
8039,Sheldon,All right all right. He can buy his own desk.
8040,Penny,Now imagine you’re holding that pen.
8041,Howard,Oh yes. There was a very official email that was sent to everyone whose insurance files indicated they had daughters between the ages of 14 and 16.
8042,Penny,Um okay sure. Luckily we sell both shoes and yogurt here.
8043,Howard,Oh don’t be such gloomy Gusses. Look at the size of these shrimp! At what point do we start calling them lobsters?
8044,Leonard,Someday when I’m up on murder charges you’ll be hearing from me.
8045,Howard,So we’d be like owners of a comic book store?
8046,Leonard,So one of us came back from the future to murder Stuart?
8047,Raj,No it’s not. I’ve always thought that was unfair.
8048,Penny,Goodbye Leonard!
8049,Sheldon,You’re just misappropriating my understanding.
8050,Penny,That sounds like fun.
8051,Sheldon,Oh that’s true. I suppose it’s only fair we make compromises.
8052,Leonard,Aren’t you going with Sheldon?
8053,Sheldon,No no. No I learned my lesson. I understand that was inappropriate.
8054,Penny,Oh yeah just the first one. I didn’t save them all.
8055,Penny,So we’ll just be friends.
8056,Penny,Even Doctor Who.
8057,Howard,What are you doing?
8058,Sheldon,All right so less or equally awkward got it.
8059,Sheldon,Hurts doesn’t it? You know I find myself wondering if anything you’ve ever told me is true.
8060,Raj,Like I said you ladies have fun.
8061,Leonard,All right cool. I think you’ll like the next one better. All the cheerleaders are suffering from an evil curse.
8062,Leonard,Thank you Sheldon.
8063,Howard,Hello.
8064,Sheldon,Oh dear Lord. Where’s Amy?
8066,Penny,Yeah.
8067,Sheldon,That’s the sauce my mother uses. She likes cooking Italian because according to her that’s what the Romans made Jesus eat.
8068,Leonard,Um I don’t really know how to say this.
8069,Sheldon,It’s a conversation starter.
8070,Sheldon,What a remarkable woman.
8071,Raj,Before you go at least let me pack you some Attack of the Scones for the road.
8072,Penny,Well he was going on and on about this college and that grad school and I didn’t want him to think I was some stupid loser.
8073,Sheldon,If that’s Morse code that’s terrible. As I was saying you and Leonard had a disappointing sexual encounter. Earlier this evening Leonard characterized it as just fine. So what you’re seeing here is a continuation of the mocking that followed.
8074,Leonard,Stay down bitch. Yeah ha ha natural selection at work.
8075,Howard,No. I got them all cut.
8076,Leonard,Oh no. No come on. I have a friend in you. You said so.
8077,Leonard,Hi.
8078,Sheldon,Is he? Well then it seems we have reached an impasse. I see no other option than to challenge you to a duel. I’d smack you with a glove but just last week I packed away my winter things.
8079,Sheldon,But seriously even if I disregard the Uncle Carl factor at best I have 60 years left.
8080,Howard,Train day?
8081,Leonard,Yeah yeah now that’s you obnoxious and insufferable.
8082,Leonard,Hi.
8083,Penny,I know what it means Sheldon! God you know I have been in L.A. for almost two years now and I haven’t got a single acting job I have accomplished nothing haven’t gotten a raise at work haven’t even had sex in six months and just now when I was walking up those stairs a fly flew in my mouth and I ate it.
8084,Leonard,Sheldon! We’re working here!
8085,Raj,When I call him his phone plays Brown Eyed Girl. Which now that I think about it is not so good.
8086,Sheldon,Would you like some aloe vera? You just got burned. All right my turn. Howard Bernadette. Daq tu’ taH Daq yIn tlhej ghajtaH.
8087,Sheldon,Oh my goodness. Where do I begin? For instance my laptop contained four out of the five gedanken experiments necessary for a cogent restatement of the quantum measurement problem.
8089,Sheldon,Ooh that’s a lot of carbohydrates for a man on the prowl. You know what? You eat it. You’re married it doesn’t matter what you look like.
8090,Raj,Seriously guys I don’t want to know.
8091,Penny,You threatened to sue?
8092,Penny,Come here. Just listen to me. I want to go back to the way we were before. You know friends. No sprinkles.
8093,Sheldon,Sarcasm?
8094,Sheldon,What a Gryffindor sleeping with a Hufflepuff? How scandalous. You naughty girl you went to the Wizarding World theme park without me.
8095,Sheldon,Dr. Plimpton I’d like you to meet my colleagues Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali
8096,Sheldon,It’s pretty convincing huh? And it wasn’t even a real person. And here is the clincher. A lock of Maggie’s flaming auburn hair.
8097,Raj,You know what would be great? Let’s do it like the old days.
8098,Leonard,Not easy but we’re making it work.
8099,Sheldon,Wait excuse me but it’s much more Christmassy than anything you’ve put on the tree.
8100,Raj,What? Why?
8101,Penny,Sheldon that is incredible.
8102,Penny,As long as things keep going great between us you’ll keep asking me to marry you and eventually I’m gonna end up saying yes and then we’re gonna be married forever and the whole thing just freaks me out.
8103,Penny,Not always. Unless your date drives a van with an air mattress then always.
8104,Sheldon,Howard?
8106,Sheldon,I said to myself I think I can I think I can. And then I couldn’t so I paid two men who promised not to come rob us later.
8107,Penny,So movies yes or no?
8108,Penny,Good night real Amy.
8109,Raj,I went and looked. It was a high and tiny window. She must have been very motivated.
8110,Leonard,This was Feynman’s van? That’s so cool.
8111,Sheldon,And that is the answer to the question what is wrong with eating at The Cheesecake Factory?
8112,Sheldon,The online game? Bully!
8113,Penny,Mm.
8114,Sheldon,Do I say stop what or just throw in the towel?
8115,Sheldon,You honestly think you can buy back my friendship with a cheap souvenir?
8116,Penny,Yeah she wants me to take him shopping for sheets and towels.
8117,Sheldon,Those are the robes of the Jedi the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy.
8118,Penny,Trust me this is the right thing.
8119,Raj,What are you doing?
8120,Sheldon,Gentlemen please this is a significant decision. Now do Amy and I continue living together? Or do I move back in with Leonard?
8121,Sheldon,Say it. Arthur say it. Say I’m annoying. Say it. Say it. I’m annoying. Say it.
8122,Leonard,All I’m saying is if they can cure yellow fever and malaria why can’t they do something about lactose intolerance?
8123,Sheldon,I’m sorry. I just love that line. Even the way you do it.
8124,Howard,Oh come on man. Bros before… my sister.
8125,Penny,What what do you mean? Are you breaking up with me?
8126,Leonard,Well you have me.
8127,Leonard,Ow!
8128,Leonard,Well that part’s true!
8130,Sheldon,It was a Monday afternoon. You joined us for Indian food.
8131,Sheldon,We would indeed. In this particular case your lack of femininity works to our advantage.
8132,Sheldon,Oh I informed you thusly. I so informed you thusly.
8133,Sheldon,What would we talk about? We’ve no overlapping areas of interest I’m aware of and you know I don’t care for chit-chat.
8134,Penny,Oh that’s beautiful. What does it mean?
8135,Howard,Some of it makes sense some of it’s crazy. My point is you can’t go out with Leonard.
8136,Penny,Okay. Well wait what about Leonard?
8137,Sheldon,Second um I thought your paper was inspired.
8138,Sheldon,Well I don’t know we’re all Groot? Just tell me.
8139,Raj,Why should I back off you back off dude.
8140,Leonard,It came to $28.17. Let’s say six bucks apiece.
8141,Leonard,I don’t care. I’m done.
8142,Leonard,That’s a relief.
8144,Raj,Sheesh.
8146,Howard,I’m so not talking to you. I’m talking to him.
8147,Raj,Oooh.
8148,Sheldon,Apparently you can’t hack into a government supercomputer and then try to buy uranium without the Department of Homeland Security tattling to your mother.
8149,Howard,Well I don’t think you have to worry about Penny telling my sister that.
8150,Raj,We haven’t settled on anything yet.
8151,Raj,Holy crap. It’s like Silence of the Lambs down here.  Don’t do that!
8153,Sheldon,Thanks for your consideration now please leave.
8154,Sheldon,I was giving clear concise orders.
8155,Sheldon,Jenga I win!
8156,Penny,Truth.
8157,Sheldon,You can’t go out it’s Halo night.
8158,Sheldon,And if they have any of those tiny bottles of shampoo?
8159,Howard,Yeah yeah me too. I didn’t do anything.
8160,Raj,Gentlemen have you come to the realization that the only reasonable course of action is to sell the ring and divide the money?
8161,Raj,Three two one.
8162,Penny,I myself grew up in Nebraska. Small town outside of Omaha. You know nice place mostly family farms a few meth labs.
8163,Howard,When can I sit with you again?
8164,Leonard,Or in this case the bar mitzvah boy with pinkeye.
8165,Sheldon,Do you know that when I get out of the shower she eyes me up and down like I’m a piece of meat?
8166,Leonard,Oh uh clear nail polish. I had a mani-pedi. Men can get those. Anyway I may owe you an apology.
8167,Leonard, Ah it’s Penny.
8168,Penny,So what do we got going on tonight huh? Playing Halo watching Battlestar drop some mentos in diet coke?
8169,Raj,He’s using psychological warfare. We must reply in kind. I say we wait until he looks at us then laugh like yes you are a smart and strong competitor but we are also smart and strong and we have a reasonable chance of defeating you.
8170,Penny,Okay why are you arguing about this?
8171,Sheldon,Honestly I’ve been better. Do you have time? Leonard says you’re very busy these days.
8172,Penny,Sorry I forgot.
8173,Howard,I can’t tell you that. But perhaps the killer dropped a fun and imaginative clue somewhere in the apartment.
8174,Howard,Gamma.
8175,Leonard,To live with Penny and not you you crazy bastard.
8176,Penny,You know if you pump at the bar I promise we’ll get free drinks.
8177,Sheldon,For an audience with the queen yes. For an evening of passing a bottle of fortified wine around a flaming trash can you look great.  What am I thinking? Whiskers!
8178,Penny,Frenzy frenzy frenzy frenzy frenzy!
8179,Leonard,Psst! Psst!
8180,Leonard,What are we gonna do?
8181,Sheldon,Well there are others who might be more qualified but the thought of interviewing them gave me a stomach ache. Now I know I’m proposing an enormous undertaking so why don’t you take a few moments to discuss it?
8182,Sheldon,At the end of the ceremony all the students throw those pointy hats in the air. It’s all pomp and circumstance until someone loses an eye.
8184,Leonard,So this is accurate?
8185,Penny,And that girls is how you make a phony phone call.
8186,Penny,Oh my inference is justified. Sheldon you are so funny. Anyway I need to do my laundry too because these clothes are so dirty. Almost as dirty as the dirty girl who’s wearing them.
8187,Sheldon,A little tremor that turns routine sinus surgery into a frontal lobotomy. Oh I don’t care for this at all. Oh I need to see he’s okay.
8188,Leonard,So which one do you think it is matey?
8189,Raj,I’m curious. In the “How Well Do You Know Sheldon” section what do you put for his favourite amino acid?
8190,Leonard,What?
8191,Leonard,Hey you got Snoopy out. Can I have a snowcone?
8192,Sheldon,Why wasn’t that Plan A?
8193,Sheldon,Never mind you won’t get it right I’d better come with you.
8194,Sheldon,I’ve been sitting in garbage!
8195,Penny,Oh stop it! Bye guys.
8196,Sheldon,There’s no need to get frustrated people learn at different rates. Unlike objects falling in a vacuum which…? MA equals MG?
8197,Sheldon,Does it affect me?
8198,Sheldon,Since Amy and I have been living together we’ve been bickering like my parents used to.
8199,Penny,Oh. Then never mind.
8200,Leonard,Yes.
8201,Penny,Oh cool. Are there pictures?
8202,Sheldon,Can I have one more moment with Leonard?
8203,Leonard,I’m not allergic to latex.
8204,Howard,Excuse me. I can’t be drinking I’m about to make an important scientific discovery here.
8205,Raj,All right uh forget pulling. How about we get an electric saw and cut it off?
8206,Raj,My pleasure nothing makes me happier than the chance to spoil a lady. Just ask my dog. My vet says if I give her any more foie gras she’s going to die of gout.
8207,Sheldon,It is extracted from the plant…
8208,Raj,Wow. You’re not only our first astronaut. You’re also the first one of us to kick a girl out of bed. You’re like a rock star.
8209,Raj,Seriously? I’m heartbroken and you’re hitting on me?
8210,Sheldon,There was a project I’ve been thinking about starting.
8211,Sheldon,He has glasses and I’m a know-it-all we are not built for prison.
8212,Leonard,Hey what’s going on?
8213,Sheldon,I hope you’re right. ‘Cause a grown man living with his brother and his brother’s wife is weird.
8215,Leonard,Oh no no no he doesn’t.
8216,Sheldon,May I say something?
8217,Penny,Will you go with me?
8218,Sheldon,Oh Leonard. Now how can you not get that?
8219,Leonard,What? Congratulations.
8220,Sheldon,Copy that Red Five. Radio contact is sufficient. No need to extend your middle finger.
8221,Howard,Congratulations.
8222,Leonard,In fact if you want we can do it right here on Sheldon’s spot.
8223,Leonard,What can I tell you? They probably have steaks on sale at that big-ass Costco over there.
8224,Raj,Thanks.
8225,Leonard,Congratulations.
8226,Leonard,Oh my God.
8227,Penny,I’m sorry. You know what I’m talking about though.
8228,Penny,Hey Sheldon.
8229,Leonard,I didn’t see it.
8230,Leonard,I’m sorry don’t listen to him. We’re actually physicists. We’re giving a lecture at Berkeley later today. We just we had some time to kill.
8231,Howard,No you didn’t. There are millions of data points there.
8232,Raj,Why do you need Kripke? Can’t you just go to Party City for helium?
8233,Sheldon,I’m not. No offence.
8234,Sheldon,Why on earth are you telling me all this?
8235,Leonard,Oh. Okay. Tomorrow you’re going to get a card in the mail. Just throw it away.
8236,Leonard,Isn’t it kind of nice? I mean he was with the wrong person and now he found the right person.
8237,Sheldon,Gladly.
8238,Penny,Yeah good call.
8239,Sheldon,You’re far too short to be Darth Vader. At best you might be a turncoat Ewok.
8240,Leonard,Hey uh penny you want to hear something awesome?
8241,Sheldon,Leonard I’m not expert here but I believe in the context of a luncheon invitation you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements.
8242,Raj,How did you get it?
8243,Leonard,Give me back that juice.
8244,Penny,Ooh I can’t do that. If I stand over a steaming pot my hair just goes boing! What else could I do?
8245,Raj,Uh Origin of Species.
8246,Sheldon,You got emotional when that lab monkey died.
8247,Penny,Okay I can answer that one I’ll be bored.
8248,Sheldon,Fine. You took my room. You turned my friends against me. I hope you’re happy.
8249,Penny,Question one. Given the choice of anyone in the world whom would you want as a dinner guest?
8250,Penny,Please don’t do that.
8251,Sheldon,Uh one question about that picture. Can it be with George Lucas? Ooh grumpy you are.
8252,Penny,You want to talk?
8253,Sheldon,Yes well I’m the Doppler Effect.
8255,Leonard,Okay have fun.
8256,Raj,Me too.
8257,Leonard,I don’t know if you want to do that I was just okay never mind.
8258,Penny,So did you wind up sending that machine back?
8259,Sheldon,You are free to believe whatever you like. And unfriend Rajesh Koothrappali.
8260,Sheldon,Look at that the problem solved itself.
8261,Leonard,So is that it? Are are we engaged?
8262,Penny,Oh yeah you can’t sit there.
8263,Raj,And you’re eating alone at a deli. I don’t buy it you’re not him.
8264,Leonard,There you go Howard. Sounds like Raj’ll have your babies problem solved.
8265,Leonard,Of course I do. She’s a great actress. I’m proud she’s taking this risk.
8266,Raj,Ever since I was a little boy my father wanted me to be a gynaecologist like him. How can I be a gynaecologist I can barely look a woman in the eye. You know what I’m not going to let my parents control my future any longer it’s time for a showdown. Somebody give me a computer with a webcam.
8267,Leonard,I just assumed. Who sells a full sized time machine for $800?
8268,Sheldon, Penny?
8269,Howard,I talk with my eyes.
8270,Raj,It’s a piercing. So uh how many tattoos?
8271,Sheldon,W-Where are you going?
8272,Howard,I’d be more interested in a scene depicting Spock’s conception.
8273,Leonard,Oh thank God.
8274,Sheldon,Oh Howard. I appreciate the gesture but this is a graduate-level physics class. I don’t think you’d understand a single thing I was talking about.
8275,Leonard,It’s not gonna be the same without you.
8276,Penny,That is what I write on the bathroom walls. For a whimsically inventive time call Leonard Hofstadter.
8277,Sheldon,As Professor Proton always says there is no problem you can’t solve if you use your noggin.
8278,Sheldon,Alright?
8279,Leonard,Yeah. He thinks I betrayed him. I mean come on what would you guys do if you were me?
8280,Howard,Hello Priya. What’s up? How would I know if Leonard’s at work or not? Don’t be suspicious. Look if you want your relationship with Leonard to continue you’re going to have to believe whatever wild-eyed cockamamie excuse the white devil has the nerve to offer you. Okay? Yeah bye-bye. You owe me.
8281,Sheldon,What’s funny about Cylon toast?
8282,Raj,But I’m Green Lantern.
8283,Sheldon,No but that list was sounding a little thin.
8284,Leonard,Okay fine I’m I’m a horrible human being I’m the Darth Vader of Pasadena.
8285,Leonard,I’m really nervous.
8286,Howard,Wait wait. Sheldon stop being crazy for a second. How much is something like this worth?
8288,Penny,Sheldon do you have anything to say that has anything to do with you know what I’m talking about.
8289,Leonard,Okay let me try it this way uh I was at a coffee klatch with a couple of friends and one thing led to another and it turns out you’re off the team.
8290,Leonard,How about this are you familiar with the typical development for computer software?
8291,Penny,Okay shh guys guys this is it.
8292,Leonard,What are you doing?
8293,Sheldon,Twelfth century code of chivalry not exactly current. You’d also have to be knighted for that to apply.
8294,Sheldon,Making the extra effort. Good for you.
8295,Leonard,I don’t know. It-it-it’s hard sometimes. Everywhere you go guys hit on you even if I’m standing right there. And they’re all taller than me. Why is everyone taller than me? You know what this is all in my head. It’s my problem not yours.
8296,Leonard,Thank you.
8297,Raj,Oh did some bad man put us in a drawer?
8298,Leonard,But you have a whole bunch of ’em.
8299,Sheldon,I know Mr. Data isn’t supposed to smile but here it comes.
8300,Howard,And worst of all Fin Fang Foom.
8301,Sheldon,Hello Bert. What is your flag-related comment or query?
8302,Penny,Bernadette sweetie shut up.
8303,Penny,Excuse me?
8304,Sheldon,And that men of his large stature are more susceptible to a wide array of life-threatening diseases.
8305,Howard,Hey an animal can be both sacred and delicious.
8306,Leonard,Yeah.
8307,Sheldon,Are you using trains to trick me into giving you advice?
8308,Raj,Which would have been two and a half if they ordered the souffle when they sat down.
8309,Leonard,At least I know not to blab to a girl about somebody flirting with her boyfriend.
8310,Penny,Sweetie you can be any pastry you want.
8311,Sheldon,Oh well great then here you sign here date here and Penny if you could initial here to indicate that you’re accepting Leonard in as is condition.
8312,Sheldon,Maybe you’re right.
8313,Penny,Uh keep your mouth off other women.
8314,Howard,Excuse me.
8315,Raj,But you’re okay with Superman concealing his identity with a pair of glasses?
8316,Penny,What’s up?
8317,Raj,They’re here. Our action figures have arrived. This is the best five hundred dollars I’ve ever spent.
8318,Sheldon,So there is the possibility however remote that resting in her loins is the potential for another individual as remarkable as myself.
8319,Leonard,Oh hold on.
8320,Leonard,What?
8321,Penny,Oh Amy come on.
8322,Leonard,I’m on it.  Hi Mrs. Wolowitz. Is is Howard there? Okay thanks. That particular dog of war will have to call you back after his bath.
8323,Howard,It’s possible she may have misunderstood us.
8324,Leonard,Sheldon can you believe that we’re driving in a van that was owned by one of the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century? It’s like the Batmobile. If Batman was real and a physicist and his car wasn’t cool.
8325,Penny,Okay give. Can you guys handle this or not?
8327,Leonard,It’ll be good to have him back.
8328,Sheldon,Yeah provided he has already read Infinite Crisis and 52 and is familiar with the re-establishment of the DC multiverse.
8329,Sheldon,I’ll be back.
8330,Sheldon,Of course it is. Even talking to you is sufficiently menial that I can feel the proverbial juices starting to flow.
8331,Leonard,Priya and I are both adults. We didn’t betray Raj.
8332,Penny,It’s passion fruit new on the menu.
8333,Howard,Yeah of course. We have no secrets.
8334,Howard,Okay yeah that’s pretty good.
8335,Leonard,Thanks again for coming. Six hours was gonna be a long drive by myself.
8336,Howard,Sure you can. Do it! Do it!
8337,Sheldon,Well I actually might be able to help.
8338,Leonard,Pretty sure.
8339,Penny,Oh my God.
8340,Penny,Wait wait. Aren’t you going to go talk to him?
8341,Raj,Can you believe Stuart’s walking around taking credit for this party?
8342,Leonard,Sheldon the world is filled with dirty discarded socks.
8343,Leonard,Just think. Thanks to your hard work an international crew of astronauts will boldly go
8345,Sheldon,Was he the one who used your head to open a nut?
8346,Howard,No I’m not gay. If anything I’m metrosexual.
8348,Leonard,Because I didn’t want to sound like a jerk.
8349,Sheldon,How about four thousand. One for every domino I set up to make that American flag. Please enjoy these highlights.
8350,Leonard,Well she’s done.
8351,Leonard,Remember show your work.
8352,Leonard,General Order 104 Section A does not apply in this situation.
8353,Sheldon,I know when I’m beat.
8354,Sheldon,She’s still not answering.
8355,Sheldon,I have a working knowledge of the important things in the universe. Good luck.
8356,Leonard,Do you think Penny’s mad at me?
8357,Sheldon,Yes they’re interviewing me by phone from my office regarding the recent so-called discovery of magnetic monopoles in spin-ices. It’s pledge week and they’re trying to goose the ratings with a little controversy.
8358,Raj,Uh that was my dad on the phone. He moved out.
8359,Sheldon,Oh an excellent idea! I could certainly use a break.
8360,Sheldon,Well now well that’s hurtful.
8361,Leonard,What are you doing?!
8362,Penny,Oh my God. I didn’t used to like you.
8363,Penny,Oh we would love that.
8364,Penny,Sheldon I am really really sorry but it’s only for a week. Can’t you be a little bit flexible? Yeah sorry. I didn’t really think that through.
8365,Sheldon,Okay. Go ahead.
8366,Leonard,How was it resolved?
8367,Penny,What?
8368,Howard,Cute? It’s not cute. Cute is children dressed as vegetables.
8369,Raj,But I also upset Sheldon and he’s not gonna want to come over if I’m there.
8370,Sheldon,It was a compliment. I believe in giving credit where credit is due.
8371,Sheldon,Yeah and my eighth favourite episode of Professor Proton was Alka-Seltzer rocket. You said plop plop fizz fizz oh what a blast-off it is. Remember? Remember that? Remember?
8373,Penny,Sheldon I don’t understand. I thought you said you were fine with it.
8374,Sheldon,Historically I don’t do well with change.
8375,Penny,I’m sorry to hear about you and Amy.
8376,Raj,Maybe that’s what they want to talk about.
8377,Penny,Well yeah.
8378,Sheldon,I’ve been cooped up in here too long. Maybe I need some fresh air.
8379,Howard,Wonder what she saw in that guy.
8380,Leonard,That’s how I’m going to make it look.
8381,Howard,Someone should really close that loading door.
8382,Raj,Who wants hot cinnamon rolls?
8383,Howard,Oooh he’s got me.
8384,Raj,Oh I miss her already.
8385,Penny,Well either that or he’s lost his tie rack and gotten really into Bryan Adams.
8386,Sheldon,Or that’s complete poppycock which Amy made up. It still could be the map.
8387,Leonard,How long have you known Adam?
8389,Leonard,I’m not gonna make a fake appointment with a psychiatrist. What would I say is wrong with me?
8391,Sheldon,He’s not gonna make it.
8392,Sheldon,I can’t bring the nitrogen tank down.
8393,Sheldon,Would you prefer a simpler application of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle in which I could either know where you are or whether I like you but not both?
8394,Penny,Seriously let him go.
8395,Leonard,It’s take your daughter to work day.
8396,Sheldon,I can’t believe I didn’t bring my gieger counter. You know I had it on my bed and I didn’t pack it.
8397,Sheldon,Nothing odd. I just wanted to rub Amy’s nose in it.
8398,Sheldon,Interesting. I suppose if someone could teach sign language to KoKo the gorilla I could teach you some rudimentary physics.
8399,Sheldon,Okay. So Feynman Einstein and Schrodinger walk into a bar. Feynman says it appears
8400,Howard,Well if you want privacy let go of the ring. I’m so glad we came to this gentile strip club! Howard here’s more bacon to tuck into the shiksa’s G-string!
8401,Sheldon,Uh hello and welcome to a special live edition of Dr. Sheldon Cooper…
8402,Sheldon,Hello.
8403,Sheldon,Uh it also wouldn’t have happened if in the early universe hydrogen was a little more common or a little less common. This is fun. Your turn.
8404,Sheldon,I’m not aware of any social convention that requires you to intervene at all.
8405,Leonard,We’re gonna set a date.
8406,Penny,Dr. Sheldon Cooper?
8407,Raj,I’m not hungry.
8408,Leonard,Just come with me to Raj’s.
8409,Leonard,Hey if you’re hungry there’s a breakfast buffet at the strip club next door.
8410,Raj,Also a good plan.
8411,Leonard,How is this my fault?
8413,Penny,Fifteen’s the point the point is fifteen. Give the little lady some room here it is coming out. Sixteen! Yes! Oh please tell me we’re playing for money.
8414,Leonard,Thanks for understanding Howard.
8415,Leonard,Yeah. No matter what happens we’re coming back tomorrow to watch it again.
8416,Sheldon,Fine. You can walk ahead of me and scare off the pigeons.
8417,Howard,You know you don’t worry about money. I’ll take care of everything.
8418,Sheldon,That’s a good idea get your rest. There are a lot more rich old ladies out there and Daddy needs a new linear accelerator. And I thought he didn’t learn anything from his relationship with you.
8419,Leonard,Is it too much?
8420,Leonard,No there isn’t! They’re synonyms!
8421,Penny,Well why?
8422,Sheldon,Are you suggesting a limited liability corporation? ‘Cause I did not L-L-see that coming.
8423,Penny,They’re gonna get beaten up at Walgreens. Oh sorry Sheldon I almost sat in your spot.
8424,Sheldon,What insult?
8425,Howard,Enjoy Oxnard. I’m sure your daughter’s looking forward to having you.
8426,Penny,Leonard. It’s eight a.m. It’s like the middle of the night.
8427,Leonard,Wait you invited him here?
8428,Leonard,Penny just wait. I’ve been thinking about what I said when we were in bed the other night.
8429,Sheldon,I’m not sure of the protocol. Television teaches us that the man’s supposed to sleep on the couch but of the two of us you’re clearly more sofa-sized.
8430,Leonard,Really good.
8431,Penny,Okay Sheldon what happened between you and Amy?
8432,Penny,This is really impressive.
8433,Leonard,So was there anything that Professor Abbott worked on during his life that came close to an accomplishment?
8434,Penny,Okay. Who do I make it out to?
8435,Penny,Hey what’s going on?
8436,Raj,That’s actually not a bad idea. Maybe I could even get them all together sort of like a a focus group to find out what’s wrong with me.
8437,Leonard,Oh yeah? Spell asthma.
8438,Sheldon,Violation of the roommate agreement overnight guest notification clause.
8439,Sheldon,Is the whip sound app contextually appropriate here?
8440,Howard,Ah.
8441,Sheldon,I’m sensing things have gotten awkward.
8442,Raj,Wow. I can’t believe old Smelly Pooper finally got laid.
8443,Raj,No need. I’ve already done that. Siri do you have a last name?
8444,Howard,I didn’t know you were coming again.
8445,Sheldon,No. It’s true. It means that we care so much about each other there’s enough left over for an eight-ounce reptile.
8446,Howard,You’re right. Everyone loves music.
8447,Sheldon,I’m glad because I would not have seen that coming.
8448,Sheldon,What about your pedometer?
8449,Penny,What?
8450,Leonard,Ha ha. You married an old man. Tell you what. Let’s do something fun tonight.
8451,Leonard,Penny Penny I think I know what to do. Sheldon I have some bad news.
8452,Penny,The point is this could be nothing and we are all overreacting.
8453,Penny,Pressure. I mean she’s looking at preschools she has a minivan she has a 401K. Before she talked about it I just thought that was a race.
8454,Raj,Oh my God you are such a mama’s boy.
8455,Sheldon,Oh good you’re up. I’ve written a new and improved roommate agreement that benefits me greatly. I’d like you to sign it.
8456,Leonard,Justin.
8457,Sheldon,Don’t.
8458,Penny,Well never hurts to have a spare.
8459,Howard,That’s ’cause you always fill up on chips.
8460,Penny,Oh great. Yes. And then you will see I am not wrong because if we were in outer space then anyone could pick up the hammer because it would be floating around in a weightless environment. Yeah that’s right the slow reader used science. Suck on that.
8461,Raj,Okay deal.
8462,Penny,Okay okay.
8463,Leonard,You ready to go?
8464,Leonard,With your career?
8465,Sheldon,Well isn’t Man-Man just Man?
8466,Raj,She does.
8467,Sheldon,But you don’t even like flags.
8468,Raj,Can we get another bottle of champagne for the table? Don’t worry. It’s my treat.
8469,Leonard,I know it is and if science ever discovers a second member of your species and you two would like some privacy I would be more than happy to get out of your way.
8470,Raj,Trailing badly Wolowitz needs a strike if he has any hopes of catching up with Sheldon Cooper who is dominating in the ninth frame with a career-best 68.
8471,Sheldon,But I wasn’t. ‘Cause I didn’t have any friends.
8472,Penny,All right well Heather H says the owner stared at me the whole time and didn’t blink once. Kelly M says the creepy guy who runs it asked me out then called himself stupid before I could say no. Jessica K says I told the weird owner that I liked his shirt. He took it off and gave it to me.
8473,Penny,I didn’t do the audition.
8474,Penny,Oh hey guys where’re you headed?
8475,Leonard,I knew that too.
8476,Leonard,Right. This one might be broken.
8477,Leonard,You did it. The drawbridge is down. You cross the chasm and find yourself in a small dungeon room. And in the corner chained to the wall you see a bloodied and beaten Santa Claus. He says ho ho help me.
8478,Howard,I’m sorry and how much money did your version of Frozen make?
8479,Penny,Go to sleep.
8480,Raj,Sure.
8481,Leonard,Oh not junior rodeo. What did you do?
8482,Sheldon,Smart. We don’t want any problems.
8483,Penny,I found the decaf!
8484,Leonard,No you’re not.
8485,Sheldon,It would’ve been so nice to have a place that was ours where we could just sit and read comics in peace.
8486,Sheldon,You’re right. That was insensitive of me. I have to go back to my table now. You should join us.
8487,Penny,I thought I was okay but it turns out I’m not.
8488,Leonard,These are pretty god what flavour is this?
8489,Raj,Okay let’s check out the females.
8490,Penny,We are not having coitus.
8491,Sheldon,So tomorrow?
8492,Howard,I’m just gonna say it. That’s not okay. Why can’t I be in a relationship with a girl who likes The Sound of Music?
8493,Sheldon,Unless Leonard signs the new agreement in the next 41 seconds this computer will send an e-mail to your parents in India saying that you’re in a secret relationship with the whiter-than-marshmallow-fluff Leonard Hofstadter.
8494,Leonard,After she put you to bed she went home.
8495,Penny,Nah I prefer to look at it as the one with my ex-boyfriend and his gorgeous successful and sophisticated girlfriend who makes me feel like a toothless Okie.
8496,Penny,And our butts. Not hanging it.
8497,Raj,You’re gonna have to be quieter than that.
8498,Raj,Tonight’s the night.
8499,Leonard,Sure it makes sense now. . Anyway I went upstairs and knocked on the door.
8500,Penny,That must’ve been expensive.
8501,Sheldon,Wait uh you saw her apartment?
8502,Penny,Just kissing.
8503,Sheldon,Uh well it’s scary. And sometimes I get the pedals mixed up. But more importantly driving me to work is one of the things that gives your life purpose. I can’t take that away from you so what do I do? Oh come on I’m practically feeding you the answer. I compromise.
8504,Sheldon,Are you making this a tier one friendship request?
8505,Howard,You know if we were in India this would be simpler. Five minutes with her dad twenty goats and a laptop and we’d be done.
8506,Sheldon,Well I cannot give this stuff away.
8507,Leonard,Your old Tuesday hamburger will be so broken hearted.
8508,Sheldon,I hardly think so Leonard made it very clear he doesn’t want a party.
8509,Sheldon,Yeah I do. Then no matter how he responds I am going to destroy him with a picture of a bored cat saying oh really?
8510,Penny,It’s okay go ahead.
8511,Leonard,Well your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory.
8512,Penny,Come on. What about the living organism of the workforce and the American spirit and Jiminy Crockett at the Alamo?
8513,Howard,Oh yes. In my culture it’s expected to have a chaparone to oversee a first date. Plus I want to make a good impression and no offence but with you guys here I look like six two.
8514,Sheldon,Oh I love brain teasers.
8515,Sheldon,No. It’s not the message.
8516,Sheldon,Yes. And they’re still sticky.
8517,Raj,You’re not going to prison.
8518,Howard,That’s true. He didn’t just stay there and talk about his feelings with the other psychotic villains. He he broke out and poisoned Gotham’s water supply.
8519,Leonard,No  You were saying but…
8520,Leonard,What are we going to do?
8521,Penny,Hi.
8522,Raj,Uh the one at Caltech has a crazy wait list. I warned you a lot of people apply when they’re still pregnant.
8523,Penny,Oh that’s great. You must be thrilled
8524,Leonard,It wasn’t amazing. I got a C-minus four years in a row.
8525,Leonard,Oh no. Oh you don’t want to do that.
8526,Penny,You want to talk about crazy mothers Leonard’s mom wouldn’t give him any sort of approval growing up.
8527,Sheldon,Yes I am.
8528,Sheldon,Well no that’s not true. I mean sometimes it’s Koothrappali. But we’re not supposed to say that ’cause he’s a minority.
8529,Sheldon,Lot of big talk from a man who can’t draw a chocolate chip cookie.
8530,Sheldon,Did the laser accidentally burn out your retinas?
8531,Leonard,No just neighbours.
8532,Leonard,But you forget I did ask you out in real life.
8533,Penny,And you know from past experience this table cannot support both our weight. So how’s the detector going?
8534,Leonard,I don’t know if the ticket was so much for the launch as it was for you telling the policewoman “you have to frisk me I have a rocket in my pants.”
8535,Raj,Penny. 
8536,Leonard,Stop! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop it!
8537,Penny,You mean like a pinky swear?
8538,Howard,Fine. Go ahead.
8539,Sheldon,Leonard?
8540,Leonard,This would have been so much more romantic if you didn’t have monkey hair on your finger.
8541,Leonard,Of course. Out of respect.
8542,Sheldon,I don’t understand. I thought you’d be thrilled to procreate with me.
8543,Sheldon,I’m sorry do I really need to connect the dots for you? The backwash into this glass is every pathogen that calls your mouth home sweet home. Not to mention the visitors who arrive on the dancing tongue of your subtropical girlfriend.
8544,Sheldon,In these uncertain times doesn’t humanity deserve a gift?
8545,Sheldon,Leonard the two of us can’t even carry a TV.
8547,Leonard,I think we’d make amazing parents.
8548,Sheldon,You robbed me of my greatest achievement.
8549,Penny,I mean I like a little brown sugar.
8550,Sheldon,How would I know? I’m not listening to you.
8551,Penny,It’s not complicated. Amy’s driving that’s it.
8552,Sheldon,Do you want to come with me?
8553,Sheldon, Is this your card?
8554,Leonard,Go out and celebrate. But not your worst idea.
8555,Sheldon,Oh of course you are. Feel free to drop by any time.
8556,Howard,See? Better with the accent.
8557,Sheldon,Well it has. Ask anybody.
8558,Leonard,Sure. What are you doing?
8559,Raj,Yeah look. Breasts and everything.
8560,Howard,Damn it.
8561,Penny,Whatcha doin’?
8562,Leonard,If I need a break I’ll ask for a break.
8563,Howard,Good?
8564,Penny,All right.
8565,Howard,Good talk.
8566,Penny,Sure.
8568,Sheldon,No wait uh hold on. Oh what you are. Aren’t you sweet?
8569,Sheldon,Yes if she googles Leopold Houston she’ll find a facebook page an online blog depicting his descent into drug use and a desperate yet hopeful listing on e-harmony.com.
8570,Sheldon,Okay back to me. I discovered an asteroid and now I get to name it.
8571,Raj,What suddenly I’m not good enough for you?
8573,Sheldon,Yeah you make a good point. It would appear I was worried for nothing. Look at her desperately wishing she was over here at the cool table. Don’t worry little moth. The flame will come to you.
8574,Sheldon,This is how the Flash paces.
8575,Leonard,This one is too.
8576,Howard,Or it turned into mustard Kryptonite the only way to destroy a rogue Kryptonian hotdog threatening Earth.
8577,Sheldon,Okay everybody calm down. There is a simple solution here. Raj take me to the train store and then I don’t care what you people do.
8578,Leonard,What are you talking about?
8579,Howard,Forty-five.
8580,Sheldon,Oh please you know I’ll tell you how he did it. Implacable relentless badgering. In urology terms he was a drug-resistant staph infection. And she was a urethra that could not shake him.
8581,Leonard,Problem?
8582,Sheldon,No no that’s crazy. You go ahead and talk while I figure it out.
8583,Leonard,Well you clearly did something to aggravate her.
8584,Howard,Okay maybe we should just end this.
8585,Penny,Oh we went out a couple of times.
8586,Sheldon,But why should you get to go and leave me here with your bickering parents?
8587,Penny,Bye.
8588,Penny,Well I was getting your stupid umbrella but all right. What’s troubling you buddy?
8589,Howard,Oh my goodness. Aren’t you the cutest little Yorkie ever? You got him for me?
8590,Howard,Son of a gun you’re blowing my mind!
8591,Leonard,No it’s it’s almost done. I just I have to find the next of kin and send ’em the DVD and then just wait for someone with my complexion to die so I can get a skin graft.
8592,Howard,Oh not really just hang out.
8593,Sheldon,Well in addition to Amy leaving me Leonard’s moving in with Penny. It’s difficult not to feel abandoned.
8594,Leonard,I’m sorry what is this plan you have?
8595,Howard,That’s what she said.
8597,Howard,I know.
8598,Leonard,How many times have I asked you not to do that?
8599,Sheldon,What a wonderful day thank you.
8600,Sheldon, Birthday girl.
8601,Sheldon,Not very.
8602,Sheldon,I wrote a paper on our idea.
8603,Sheldon,I’ve decided I’m going to have Mr. Lee sign my copy of this month’s Batman.
8604,Leonard,You know what if you ever want to talk to me about a problem in your life with a guy then I would be fine with that.
8605,Leonard,Well we are because Dr. Gallo made me realize that I’m a worthwhile person and that my feelings matter.
8606,Raj,Hey I don’t even live here.
8607,Sheldon,You make sissy on your belt buckles? Mee-Maw’s forks never had that.
8608,Howard,So what do you guys want to do?
8609,Raj,Yeah it’s nothing to cry about.
8610,Sheldon,It’s live. Go go go go go.
8611,Penny,Laura that half the dirty movies you own are animated.
8612,Leonard,Okay well this is cool. Uh there’s a thing called superfluid vacuum theory where empty space is imagined as a superfluid with all of its qualities viscosity density surface tension…
8613,Leonard,Sheldon this is ridiculous.
8614,Penny,Soon.
8615,Penny,Just so you know that guy in the parking lot hit me.
8616,Penny,Not with a thousand condoms Howard.
8617,Sheldon,I always tell people if you have only one day in Los Angeles make it a train day.
8618,Howard,Oh come on. I don’t want to sit by myself.
8619,Penny,I liked it. I’m excited.
8620,Leonard,Okay how do we catch it?
8621,Sheldon,Kripke?
8622,Penny,And Leonard didn’t want to work with you? Imagine that.
8623,Sheldon,Just look. I’ve designed the perfect uniforms for our team. The colours are based on Star Trek the original series. The three of you will wear support red and I will wear command gold.
8624,Penny,So Sheldon’s last roommate tried to warn you off?
8625,Howard,You guys made a person.
8626,Penny,No if it was a spider Lenny would’ve flipped out.
8627,Sheldon,Wow. Uh you’re dead so I’m going to let that slide. Obi-Wan Kenobi is a character from Star Wars. After his physical demise he comes to Luke Skywalker as his mentor in spirit form.
8628,Sheldon,Well I took out the bad words and the yeehaw but you get the gist.
8629,Raj,Wow so you’re not curious at all?
8630,Sheldon,Oh that’s preposterous. I’m not pining over anyone.
8631,Howard,Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee.
8632,Leonard,Comic book store.
8633,Sheldon,I’m helping you with Stephanie.
8634,Raj,Oh like you and I did at couples therapy.
8635,Sheldon,Now in this pivotal scene Sheldon’s mother played by you argues with an emissary of the United Federation of Planets Mr. Spock the role I will bring to life.
8636,Sheldon,Roll the dice Leonard.
8637,Sheldon,Okay. Does that planet have to be Earth?
8638,Sheldon,What do manners have to do with it? This is war. Were the Romans polite when they salted the ground of Carthage to make sure nothing would ever grow again?
8639,Penny,I meant more like a little brother.
8640,Sheldon,I’m not asking for me I’m asking for Hawking.
8641,Penny,Wow I just felt this wave of affection for you.
8642,Leonard,Does that change things?
8643,Howard,When did you figure out you were allergic to nuts?
8644,Raj,Here you can have your seat.
8645,Leonard,All right let me start again. Uh you and Amy…
8646,Raj,My stomach. Indian food doesn’t agree with me. Ironic isn’t it?
8647,Penny,Sandwich shop.
8648,Sheldon,I don’t know but apparently I’m in some kind of relationship and you seem to be an expert at ending them.
8649,Raj,I’m so sick of people being mean on the Internet.
8650,Penny,Thank you I’ve got to talk to that mailman.
8651,Howard,Aha! So I am working with you.
8652,Sheldon,Clarify something for me. Isn’t the point of a communal meal the exchange of ideas and opinions? An opportunity to consider important issues of the day?
8653,Penny,Uh no no not really. Listen didn’t you say you needed some eggs.
8654,Leonard,That we go back to the way things were. But when I do something for you you show a little appreciation.
8655,Sheldon,Fair enough.
8656,Penny,I’ll pay you back as soon as I can.
8657,Penny,Uh what time is it?
8658,Penny,All right we’re heading out.
8659,Raj,I know. I mean do I open it? Do I return it?
8660,Sheldon,I don’t want any more but let’s go.
8661,Raj,So all right there he is. So should we introduce ourselves?
8662,Sheldon,I’m still upset about that peanut sauce.
8663,Leonard,And oh that’s me getting rescued after I fell in.
8664,Leonard,No. Why do you ask?
8665,Sheldon,Oh ooh! And that makes Leonard angry.
8666,Howard,No it’s a gentle kick you’re doing it wrong. Here. Give me those.
8667,Penny,Oh I’ll have some wine and listen to people go on about crap I don’t understand. I mean how is it any different than every single day of my life?
8668,Howard,Wait. What the hell is ding?
8670,Raj,Ooh uh Emily gets off work soon. Why don’t the four of us go out?
8671,Howard,To be truthful Emily and I haven’t dated that long and we never agreed to be exclusive to each other.
8673,Raj,Well we were just on our way to lunch and wanted to see if you’d like to join.
8674,Penny,Hey.
8675,Sheldon,You’re forgetting something. Ladies love jocks.
8676,Penny,Yeah.
8677,Howard,I know that. But to be fair I’ve spent nine months helping Bernadette get ready for this baby and Howard spent five minutes conceiving it. And I’m being generous.
8678,Sheldon,Seriously? Airborne worms?
8679,Howard,It’s on like Alderaan.
8680,Sheldon,Raj you’re probably wondering why Amy and I aren’t showing any affection to one another.
8681,Penny,Okay fine Sheldon. What is your side?
8682,Sheldon,Dill slices not sweet?
8683,Howard,Ooh. Ooh ooh. We could make a video-playing device that simultaneously translates the information into a tactile medium.
8684,Sheldon,Oh but I’m not going home. It’s Wednesday Wednesday is new comic book day we have to go to the comic book store. And then we have to stop at Soup Plantation it’s creamy tomato soup day and Radio Shack there’s a sale on triple-a batteries. Plus we have to go to Pottery Barn and return my Star Wars sheets.
8685,Leonard,Batman. Batman and Robin. Uh Wonder Twins plus the monkey. Wonder Twins plus the monkey and Batman.
8686,Raj,Dude you have to stop talking like that. It’s really lame.
8687,Sheldon,I haven’t fastened my seat belt yet.
8688,Penny,How did you get paint in your eye?
8689,Howard,Leonard help.
8690,Sheldon,Zone.
8691,Howard,If it’s an alternate dimension sounds like a job for a landing party.
8692,Penny,Hmm. You think you’re five-foot-six that’s funny.
8693,Leonard,Aaargh.
8694,Sheldon,It’s a simple matter. There are several toxic chemicals that’d be untraceable in an autopsy.
8695,Sheldon,Oh it’s very simple. Scissors cuts paper paper covers rock rock crushes lizard lizard poisons Spock Spock smashes scissors scissors decapitates lizard lizard eats paper paper disproves Spock Spock vaporizes rock and as it always has rock crushes scissors.
8696,Sheldon,Oh and we’re going to use props?
8697,Sheldon,Wolowitz might hand out cigars. I had to find my bubble gum cigar so I could join in without looking foolish.
8698,Sheldon,For the record that psychotic rant was a concise summation of the research of Bertram Forer who in 1948 proved conclusively through meticulously designed experiments that astrology is nothing but pseudo scientific hokum.
8699,Sheldon,At times.
8700,Leonard,Uh kind of?
8701,Leonard,Oh yes. Indeed I did.
8702,Sheldon,You know Leonard the more I think about it there are a number of mutually owned items in this apartment that you and I should go through. Uh for example who gets our beloved sword Longclaw?
8703,Howard,Sheldon that’s my water.
8704,Sheldon,Not to mention imaginary.
8705,Leonard,What? Why?
8706,Howard,Yeah I saw something for Halley and I couldn’t resist.
8707,Sheldon,Thank you.
8708,Penny,I’m just going to go wash up.
8709,Leonard,Okay… if I may drill down to the bedrock of my question why did you throw it out.
8710,Sheldon,Ugh fine I’ll go. But if her food is delicious Thanksgiving is ruined and it’s on you.
8711,Howard,Is that right?
8712,Sheldon,No I don’t think so. Those dolls represent three things I do not care for clowns children and raggediness. I think it’s a lost cause.
8713,Howard,Uh well she’s single so if somebody else asks her out and she says yes then we know she’s not into Sheldon.
8714,Raj,I can’t see him.
8715,Raj,Are you serious?
8716,Sheldon,Not at all. In Star Wars when the stormtroopers would march in perfect formation harassing civilians didn’t you ever think hey that could be me?
8717,Sheldon,Good night indeed. What a rube. Why would I put on lotion when I have such soft hands?
8718,Penny,Leonard last night was a mistake.
8719,Sheldon,Oh Leonard. Now how can you not get that?
8720,Leonard,Stuart.
8721,Sheldon,Wait so how does the story end? Is the baby a jerk or is Bernadette a bad mother?
8722,Penny,All right. Let’s just finish cooking.
8723,Penny,So what did she say when you told her we were going out?
8724,Leonard,That’s right you saw what you saw. That’s how we roll in The Shire. 
8725,Raj,Great. Where would you like to go?
8726,Leonard,Okay at some point we’ll look back and this is going to be a funny story. Why don’t we just start doing that now?
8727,Penny,With a heavy heart Amelia stood before the newly repaired time machine. She regretted giving Cooper the part he needed.
8728,Sheldon,Do you have cookies?
8729,Penny,Huh I try.
8730,Sheldon,They lose their sensitivity to serotonin and norepinephrine.
8731,Leonard,No I mean I I I got the money first.
8732,Sheldon,Shh we’re trying to watch the movie. This is not working out with him.
8733,Sheldon,All right.
8734,Leonard,Sheldon you’re just assigning random numbers to things based on your opinion.
8735,Leonard,It’s just the four digits month and day.
8736,Penny,I don’t know.
8737,Leonard,Uh yeah uh I just I got your mail again here.
8738,Leonard,Well why would you want to be on someone’s team who you like to call a I can’t even say it in front of Sheldon.
8739,Leonard,Really. Who do you think did that Sheldon?
8740,Sheldon,They sound delicious but this money is earmarked for scones.
8741,Raj,Whether you call it God or the universe or the self we’re all interconnected and that’s just a beautiful… Son of a bitch that guy just dinged my car. S seriously? You were just gonna drive away? Like my life isn’t hard enough right now. A space probe might be destroyed my parents are going through an awful divorce the guy who cuts my dog’s hair just gave her bangs.
8742,Leonard,No.
8743,Raj,Actually I’m still here.
8744,Leonard,Really? Here?
8745,Penny,Good night Leonard.
8747,Penny,I heard he was being picked on by a mean kid.
8748,Leonard,Raj you’re our group historian. Has Sheldon ever begged before?
8749,Howard,Whoa I’m calling my dad okay? He’s got experience dealing with pregnant ladies because he’s an OBGYN. And experience with crazy ladies because of my mom.
8750,Sheldon,Here look look I found my missing neutrino.
8751,Raj,I could have made her very happy.
8752,Raj,It’s okay. It’s by choice. Well their choice and it’s not okay.
8753,Sheldon,Why is that funny? That’s just unhygienic.
8754,Leonard,It’s up to you crazy person’s choice.
8755,Sheldon,I know that you worked hard to put this together. I’m sorry I’m ruining it.
8756,Penny,You’re boring people sweetie.
8757,Howard,Go ahead make fun. You can’t embarrass me I’ve got a beautiful girlfriend and a dog who loves me so much she drinks my bathwater.
8758,Sheldon,Flash-frozen brown rice not white?
8759,Penny,You kiss your mother with that mouth? ‘Cause it’s fine.
8760,Leonard,The robot didn’t hurt his feelings.
8761,Sheldon,Boy I’m not nearly as mysterious as I think I am.
8762,Sheldon,I like a party as much as the next man as long as the next man doesn’t like a party. Oh by the way don’t forget tomorrow is our quarterly roommate agreement meeting.
8763,Sheldon,Barry a word?
8764,Penny,Yikes. What’s so funny?
8765,Sheldon,Uh-oh! Industrial accident.
8766,Sheldon,Excuse me but was this not your goal? Financial independence through entrepreneurial brilliance and innovation? My brilliance and innovation of course but still.
8767,Sheldon,Zack.
8768,Raj,Hey show her the trunk. Show her the trunk.
8769,Howard,What happens in costume at Comic-con stays at Comic-con.
8770,Howard,Well I do. Next to you I’ll look like a catch.
8771,Leonard,Sheldon come here.
8772,Leonard,You do? Because if that’s what you like I can be that guy. I swear I’ll be anything you want me to be.
8773,Sheldon,I think this is the place.
8774,Penny,Got it.
8775,Raj,Yeah.
8776,Raj,How did you get your hands on that?
8777,Leonard,Of course yeah emotional chafing. Hey do you want to see something cool?  I can make this olive go into this glass without touching it.
8778,Leonard,Something’s wrong I’m not getting any gas. Anybody know anything about internal combustion engines?
8779,Sheldon,Any intelligent organism would at the very least need the ability to locate the position of objects in space. So the ideal interstellar lingua franca would be haptic.
8780,Howard,Sheldon says impossible. Howard and I say not only possible but as a mode of transportation way cooler than a Batmobile.
8781,Penny,Leonard what time does your mom’s plane get in?
8782,Penny,Sure anything.
8783,Penny,Oh big deal. Not knowing is part of the fun.
8784,Leonard,Come on. It’s okay.
8785,Leonard,Aw. What’s wrong with her?
8786,Leonard,Oh great there’s Mandy.
8787,Penny,Sheldor?
8788,Leonard,57 58 59 that’s one minute.
8789,Raj,Why?
8790,Leonard,I am taking Penny.
8791,Leonard,Oh Penny I am so sorry.
8792,Sheldon,Alright Kripke that last interest strikes me as the least objectionable and I would like to propose that we do that together. Tomorrow. Yes I’ll pay. Alright goodbye. Alright! Time to learn rock climbing.
8793,Penny,Then why did you tell me you had it?
8794,Sheldon,Sheldon Cooper’s descent into madness day two. It’s 225 a.m. and I feel the urge to urinate. My normal urination time is 710 a.m. but here I am in the middle of the night struggling to keep my mind sharp and my pajamas dry. It’s only a matter of time before my tenuous grasp on reality fades. I suppose I should pee while I still know what a toilet is.
8795,Howard,Mmm I love how they put a waterfall at centre field. It really ties the whole stadium together.
8796,Sheldon,Yes. As it turns out there’s an article on how to get over a breakup in literally every issue. Anyway it suggests that I set these on fire but the smell of burning books reminds me of church picnics in East Texas.
8797,Sheldon,How dare the university force me to go back to string theory?
8798,Penny,I’m fine.
8799,Penny,So Klingon boggle?
8800,Penny,You idiot what the hell do you have in there?!
8801,Penny,I really think this is gonna be for the best.
8802,Penny,But it it doesn’t matter. We know the answer come on.
8803,Howard,Very very smart guys.
8804,Sheldon,Meemaw resisted at first but now she loves it.
8805,Penny,Fine faint.
8806,Sheldon,Actually I don’t need a team I could easily defeat you single-handedly. But the rules require four so may I introduce the third floor janitor he lady from the lunchroom and my Spanish is not good either her son or her butcher. And what about your team? What rat have you recruited to the SS Sinking Ship?
8808,Sheldon,Uh just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly.
8809,Raj,What?
8810,Sheldon,They took our TV two laptops four external hard-drives our PS2 our PS3 our X-Box our X-Box 360 our classic Nintendo our Super Nintendo our Nintendo 64 and our Wii.
8811,Howard,Hang on. No offence to her father but he’s not an MIT trained engineer. Thinking and building is what you do.
8812,Leonard,Okay um look I’m pretty sure she didn’t wink at you.
8813,Sheldon,Shame on you! That’s no dream for a scientist!
8815,Raj,I’m so lonely.
8816,Leonard,Look at that I built a fireplace with my own two hands.
8817,Howard,It’s getting beautiful again.
8818,Raj,Hey come on guys focus. Um uh oh mighty Nicolas Cage tree we thank you for your warning but we are brave warriors and nothing short of death will keep us from our goal.  Oh Lucy’s free after all. See ya.
8819,Sheldon,Kind of a wuss.
8820,Leonard,It’s a classic right?
8821,Leonard,Raj no it’s a trap they’re flanking us!
8822,Raj,Well uh how about you keep the store open late and we throw a party for all the people who don’t have dates?
8823,Leonard,Really?
8825,Raj,What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to choose between Emily and Lucy?
8826,Sheldon,Why would your Bernadette thing make me feel better? At least mine was educational.
8827,Raj,Almost. Franken Berry Boo Berry Sugar Bear and the Honey Nut Cheerio bee I believe his name is Buzz.
8828,Sheldon,Why don’t I just eat in my desk chair?
8829,Leonard,Where are you gonna live?
8830,Leonard,No hang on. Hang on. Are all those things equal to you?
8831,Leonard,Okay. Uh uh you’re not naughty. Uh you’re you’re you’re dirty. You’re you’re a a dirty girl?
8832,Howard,We could cut it into thirds.
8833,Leonard,Make it two.
8834,Leonard,That was a great meal.
8835,Leonard,Let me guess motion sensors?
8836,Howard,Ooh I I think it’s done. Oh it worked. We printed a whistle.
8837,Sheldon,Yes and Hawkeye’s in the Avengers but no one ever says help Hawkeye.
8838,Leonard,Uh we’re going to the Comic-Con in Bakersfield. They have a big costume contest. It’s cooler than it sounds.
8839,Sheldon,Well I enjoyed that more than I thought I would.
8840,Sheldon,It seems we have a choice to make. Abandon all ground rules in the name of science or give up collaborating for the sake of our relationship.
8841,Sheldon,Crikey what flag do we have today?
8842,Penny,She.
8843,Leonard,Oh uh we played once. I broke a window.
8844,Leonard,Oh.
8845,Leonard,Mm conducting experiments in zero gravity.
8846,Leonard,Warlord beats troll troll beats elf elf beats water sprite and basically everything beats enchanted bunny.
8847,Sheldon,I feel the same way about you. Now put your glasses back on. You look weird.
8848,Leonard,You think she’s taking advantage of him?
8850,Penny,Yeah I mean I could see him eating one or two guests but not a whole party.
8852,Raj,Ask rhetorical questions that make people uncomfortable?
8853,Sheldon,Good. What’s your favourite fruit?
8854,Leonard,Howard why don’t we just work on the robot?
8855,Sheldon,So how was your day?
8856,Leonard,Nice little bot you’ve got here.
8857,Sheldon,How about your grandparents they alive?
8858,Leonard,Sure. So are we doing this?
8859,Leonard,Not the kind with access to drugs.
8860,Raj,Yeah but it’s probably difficult to pronounce.
8861,Leonard,Sorry.
8862,Penny,Hey Leonard. How’s the train ride?
8863,Howard,You’re right. Let’s talk about your grandmother.
8864,Leonard,No.
8865,Sheldon,Well then it’s settled?
8866,Penny,Oh.
8867,Leonard,It’s indoors so no sunscreen.
8868,Howard,Yes. Indeed. Absolutely. Indubitably. I’m not even sure what the last one means but it’s another word and I know it. So uh when do you want to meet up?
8869,Sheldon,No.
8870,Sheldon,Can I at least kick down the door?
8871,Leonard,Mine too. Anybody got any ideas?
8872,Sheldon,You know what? She was kind of an honorary man. She had a penis made of science.
8873,Leonard,Wow. Wouldn’t think there’d be that many.
8874,Sheldon,I’m not suggesting we really make her jump out of a pool. I thought the “bazinga” was implied. I’m just tweaking her personality sanding off the rough edges if you will.
8875,Leonard,Are you listening to yourself? Do you know how childish you sound right now?
8876,Penny,Leonard you know I will always have feelings for you.
8877,Leonard,You told her I lied why would you tell her I lied?
8878,Penny,Okay okay let’s try that last line again and this time maybe try choking up a little.
8879,Leonard,Okay where are you?
8880,Leonard,You used to it yet?
8881,Sheldon,A Godzilla-like monster is approaching the city. I have to get my people to safety. People of Sheldonopolis this is your mayor. Follow me. If the children can’t run leave them behind. Oh the simulated horror!  Raj? Just as I suspected. Meditation is nothing but hokum.
8882,Raj,Uh thank you for the drink.
8883,Leonard,I just ate aren’t you supposed to wait an hour?
8884,Sheldon,But that’s my room.
8885,Raj,Yeah Leonard who?
8886,Howard,Oh actually that’s a Van Dyke. A goatee is just hair on the chin.
8887,Penny,Oh Howard I can’t believe Bernadette let you go to a fancy party wearing a dickey.
8888,Howard,No.
8890,Raj,Well so then we start the game over until there’s a winner.
8891,Sheldon,Okay. ‘Cause if I had to pick now I’d probably go with dark matter because…
8892,Raj,Yeah see if you just change the story to the destruction of our galaxy then a super massive black hole could work.
8893,Sheldon,No I don’t want to go to sleep you can’t make me.
8894,Penny,I hear you don’t like my stuffed animals my driving or my punctuality.
8895,Leonard,We spent two hundred dollars on six minutes of fun?
8896,Howard,Hang on a sec. Why do you get first crack at her?
8897,Raj,I think you were mean before you were pregnant but it’s fine. So uh instead of cleaning out the room why don’t we just decide on a theme for the nursery?
8898,Sheldon,I accept your premise I reject your conclusion.
8899,Leonard,Palak paneer that’s Penny.
8900,Sheldon,You know what? I don’t always recognize sarcasm but I do right now and I don’t appreciate it. I’m sorry for your loss. But you’re not the only one whose day has been a disaster.
8901,Sheldon,It hurts that you would lie to me Amy. I thought our relationship was based on trust and a mutual admiration that skews in my favour.
8902,Sheldon,Wrong and let’s keep it clean shall we?
8903,Raj,Oh yes. You must be Lakshmi. Uh nice to meet you.
8904,Leonard,Okay I’m sorry.
8905,Leonard,Yeah well I wouldn’t say cool I’d just say that’s Leonard!
8906,Raj,Oh. Thank you for taking such good care of my little girl.
8907,Leonard,No Raj that’s a terrible idea.
8908,Leonard,I got a better idea. We’re all responsible. I say we all go. Come on who’s with me? Free comic books to anyone who comes with me. I might get punched. You really want to miss that?
8909,Sheldon,That’s because I didn’t bring one.
8910,Howard,Sure. I love animated movies.
8911,Penny,Okay imagine your problems are a pen.
8912,Raj,My sister.
8914,Penny,Really we’re good.
8916,Raj,Okay we’re all set.
8917,Leonard,Interesting. So now that he’s gone you want to hang out with me.
8918,Leonard,Don’t you think it might be a little weird to work for someone you used to date?
8919,Raj,Just until he gets back on his feet which are looking pretty good in the boots I bought him for his birthday.
8920,Leonard,The difference is she’s bringing life into the world and you suck it out.
8921,Penny,I’m so glad you like it.
8922,Raj,It’s my sister. Can we not talk about this any more?
8923,Leonard,Oh he’s like a different man. He stopped twitching and I think he grew an inch and a half.
8924,Sheldon,Well I was hiding from a bee but it still counts.
8925,Leonard,Once you open the box it loses its value.
8926,Penny,They’re comfortable.
8927,Penny,Thank you.
8928,Sheldon,He asked her during coitus.
8929,Sheldon,A dogapus can play fetch with eight balls. No one can hate that.
8930,Penny,Mm-hmm.
8931,Howard,I guess I’m just more of a Pottery Barn Crate and Barrel kind of guy. Maybe Pier 1 if I really want to cut loose.
8932,Raj,You know it’s been more than a year since I’ve even kissed a girl?
8933,Leonard,You won’t believe it the military confiscated our project.
8934,Sheldon,Hmm. You do get me. Someone left a comment.
8935,Leonard,What are you doing?
8936,Raj,So we’d be like owners of a comic book store?
8937,Penny,Okay Raj what’ll it be? 
8938,Sheldon,Of course if SkyNet actually did exist in the future a perfect way to infiltrate and destroy mankind would be to send Terminators back posing as actors who have played Terminators in popular films and television series lulling us into a false sense of security i.e. that’s Summer Glau from The Sarah Connor Chronicles. No Summer don’t kill me! I’m pro-robot! Ahh!
8939,Leonard,I didn’t say anything like that.
8940,Leonard,No I mean re-evaluate what we’re doing with the guidance system.
8941,Raj,Why not? With online shopping and overnight delivery I can get anything I want. Look I just ordered a case of Dinty Moore beef stew and two live lobsters on Amazon.
8942,Penny,Whew chilly.
8943,Sheldon,Go Amy Farrah Fowler. Follow your endocrine system.
8944,Leonard,And there’s your damsel.
8945,Leonard,Uh do you mind if I sit?
8946,Sheldon,Well I had to find out if it was personal correspondence or memorabilia. Now as I was saying based on the content…
8947,Sheldon,Please don’t drag this out. This is never going to come off.
8948,Penny,Hey if you guys need a fourth I’ll play.
8949,Penny,Oh there he is.
8950,Sheldon,I invited him.
8951,Penny,Okay.  What’s it supposed to… Oh my God this is so freaky!
8952,Howard,Yeah but since you and Penny finally hooked up we thought you two would be having bouncy naked yum-yum night.
8953,Penny,How about boys versus girls?
8954,Raj,Leviticus 113 “Only that which parteth the hoof and cheweth the cud among the beasts shall ye eat.”
8955,Sheldon,That’s right. And what did he do?
8956,Penny,So what? Why do you even care?
8957,Sheldon,Well it took a little negotiating but I wore him down. Uh we get the asteroid and if you and I have children they all have to be named Rajesh.
8958,Leonard,Well I think tonight was a very good start.
8959,Howard,Are you sure you want to do this? Give up your half of the 3-D printer?
8960,Penny,Oh it would be great to practice on a real doctor.
8961,Leonard,I know but I have to go to work and I made you breakfast.
8962,Leonard,Yeah cool.
8963,Sheldon,Size ratio was all wrong. Couldn’t visualize it. Needed bigger carbon atoms.
8964,Howard,Hello?
8965,Raj,Good good. ‘Cause no matter how hard I try I cannot get the twins to look alike.
8966,Leonard,Balls in the basket. 
8967,Raj,I think this thing was made in China.
8968,Howard,You know downward-facing dog comes from the Sanskrit phrase adho mukha shvanasana.
8969,Howard,If anybody cares I still have to pee.
8970,Howard,You’re really going to do this?
8971,Raj,Hello Priya. What’s up? How would I know if Leonard’s at work or not? Don’t be suspicious. Look if you want your relationship with Leonard to continue you’re going to have to believe whatever wild-eyed cockamamie excuse the white devil has the nerve to offer you. Okay? Yeah bye-bye. You owe me.
8972,Sheldon,Don’t ask me. I’m just a simple seamstress whose descendants are out to make a quick buck.
8973,Sheldon,It might speak to a cultural aspiration to have one’s children enter the medical profession.
8974,Raj,Mmm I know the feeling. It’s like accidentally walking into a gay bar and then having no one hit on you. It-It happened to a friend of mine.
8975,Leonard,Yes ma’am.
8976,Leonard,That’s the name of his gang. The Scientists. They are crazy.
8977,Sheldon,Oh I doubt that. I haven’t figured out a way and I’m much smarter than all of you.
8978,Penny,Oh great thank you again .
8979,Leonard,I hate this guy.
8980,Raj,That’s because in your dreams you’re a horse from the waist down.
8981,Howard,What? I thought we were all… never mind.
8982,Sheldon,I understand. And your loyalty is admirable. But what if I were to up the ante?
8983,Leonard,Sheldon at this point I would go by myself before I would take you.
8984,Leonard,You’re jogging.
8985,Penny,Good for you.
8986,Leonard,Uh here’s the thing. Girls like Penny never end up with guys who own time machines.
8987,Sheldon,Why not? Hairy Fairy.
8988,Sheldon,Using your sword you prepare a beautiful sushi dinner. You slip into the hot spring and enjoy the warm water on your aching joints. As you happily close your eyes you recall the incredible evening you’ve had and notice that your feet and ankles are smaller than they’ve ever been. The end.
8989,Raj,This sucks.
8990,Leonard,Hey I’ve got a good job. I could buy salmon. You don’t know.
8991,Leonard,Oh hey. You’re back. How was your trip?
8992,Sheldon,Not now Penny this poor man needs me.  You hold on I’ll be right with you. What computer do you have and please don’t say a white one?
8993,Sheldon,I’m writing an appeal to the Faculty Senate so that I can move on from string theory.
8994,Sheldon,It’s a snake. A terrifying snake.
8995,Leonard,I never wanted to play the cello. How do you meet girls playing the cello? Hey you want to come over to my house and listen to me play an instrument that sounds like a suicidal bumblebee?
8996,Leonard,Yeah like you’re afraid that if you touch her she’ll break.
8997,Raj,What is it to you?
8998,Sheldon,We have a bowl. Our keys go in a bowl. You should get a bowl.
8999,Leonard,It’s not?
9000,Leonard,Right. Be polite.
9001,Leonard,Good. Good. And what about your uh hallway friend.
9002,Leonard,How is this maritime salvage?
9003,Howard,The little fat girl that used to kick me in the samosas and call me untouchable.
9004,Sheldon,I like it. I think you’re on to something.
9005,Leonard,Nice to see a busy couple keep the spark of bureaucracy alive.
9006,Leonard,We’d still get in.
9007,Leonard,Yeah of course why?
9008,Penny,It’s just this guy I used to date.
9009,Leonard,An arrow.
9010,Sheldon,Yeah but you’ve got all those things and no one’s lining up to be you.
9011,Raj,My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
9012,Sheldon,I sense judgment on your part.
9013,Howard,And you do it all the time. Last week in the mall at Radio Shack we were looking for a phone with giant numbers for your mother and I suddenly realize you’re not even there.
9014,Leonard,Also inefficient and might be loud.
9015,Raj,Me too.
9016,Howard,We just told you.
9017,Penny,Well I was thinking about Sheldon’s little joke the other night about me eating all your food.
9018,Sheldon,Yes. You were kind enough to watch Raiders of the Lost Ark with me. So I’d like to return the favour by inviting you to watch an episode of your favourite childhood television series Little House on the Prairie.
9019,Penny, Sheldon.
9020,Sheldon,Penny Penny just to clarify because there will be a discussion when you leave is your objection solely to our presence in the apartment while you were sleeping or do you also object to the imposition of a new organisational paradigm.  Well that was a little non-responsive.
9021,Penny,Leonard I get it. You’re in a new relationship now. And I’m happy for you. So why don’t we just shake hands and part friends?
9022,Penny,Yeah I don’t need anything around that I can stab myself with.
9023,Sheldon,Yes oh but enter through the side. Batman is a load-bearing blanket.
9024,Sheldon,Wo de zhing shi Sheldon.
9025,Leonard,It’ll be fine. Just uh pretend he’s Wolowitz.
9026,Raj,Yes.
9027,Penny,Leonard Hofstadter?
9028,Leonard,I think he might be learning on his own.
9029,Leonard,Well it’s always me take one for the team.
9030,Sheldon,That’s a great idea. I’ve got it. We’ll call it Cooper.
9031,Raj,Thank you Bernadette.
9032,Raj,Well prepare to be mortified. I let my dog eat food out of my mouth not because she likes it but because I do. Also I know they’re pretty but I’m scared of butterflies.
9033,Howard,By staying here and watching the movie.
9034,Penny,Yeah it’s freaking me out. I’m gonna go.
9035,Howard,Okay uh I’m gonna own you bitch.
9036,Sheldon,No that response is unacceptable to me.
9037,Leonard,Football. I’m going to Penny’s on Saturday to watch a game with her friends and I don’t want to look like an idiot. I want to blend in.
9038,Leonard,No it’s okay. I’m gonna stab my friend in the chest.
9039,Howard,Oh fine. Let’s agree she kissed both of us.
9040,Sheldon,Please reserve that butch spirit for the lanes.
9042,Sheldon,Amy. What’s going on?
9044,Sheldon,Oh I’ve heard of that place isn’t that Pasadena’s favourite Irish watering hole.
9045,Leonard,So you’re actually okay with invading your friend’s privacy?
9046,Sheldon,Like when you do a two-hour Fourth of July spectacular and it doesn’t get recorded.
9047,Leonard,I got to admit we didn’t think you’d be able to do two things at once.
9048,Leonard,Yeah I really need to talk to you.
9049,Raj,I know. It’ll be awful.
9050,Howard,Well I choose love.
9051,Raj,Under the careful supervision of her godfather.
9052,Sheldon,Why should I let it go? I saw it first.
9053,Sheldon,Yep you’re mad.
9054,Sheldon,Oh no no let’s not sugarcoat this. You find me finicky pedantic and annoying.
9055,Leonard,What?
9056,Leonard,What the hell is that?
9057,Leonard,Well our choices are we do this with the university or we don’t do it at all.
9058,Penny,No.
9059,Penny,Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo. Spock to Enterprise. Transport successful.
9060,Raj,What happened?
9061,Raj,Wait are you saying that we didn’t have a vibe?
9062,Penny,Is he serious?
9063,Raj,Who are you bringing?
9064,Leonard,At least they don’t know it was you.
9065,Howard,Who were you respecting then?
9066,Raj,What?
9067,Raj,No I’m behind on my wiki-reading I’m kind of on a John Grisham kick right now.
9068,Sheldon,Oh really Leonard? Are you going to have another one of your hissy fits?
9069,Raj,This is exciting.
9070,Raj,Well if you’re not comfortable staying here Sheldon…
9071,Sheldon,I don’t know what you’re doing but I was about to insinuate that I had coitus with Raj’s mother for a dollar.
9072,Leonard,Penny and I have some issues we need to talk about.
9073,Penny,That was a really nice dinner. I’m glad you asked me out again.
9074,Sheldon,I think I might have tartar buildup. My tongue won’t go as far forward as it used to.
9075,Howard,I’m sorry. I did what I could.
9076,Penny,Doesn’t matter what I want. Look this job is gonna get me out of debt. So I’m gonna do the grown-up thing and see it through.
9077,Sheldon,So is the McRib sandwich. I don’t care for that either.
9078,Leonard,Oh come on you know you’re overreacting.
9079,Sheldon,You don’t think that crosses a line?
9080,Leonard,I’m sorry.
9081,Leonard,My friend does make a decent point about the money. I don’t feel comfortable just handing it over up front.
9082,Sheldon,Oh look it’s the Scientific American that covered the paper Leonard and I wrote.
9083,Leonard,I don’t need backup. I have right on my side. And I’m wearing cargo shorts under my pants.
9084,Raj,No no. After we got undressed and jumped in bed you you asked if I had protection.
9085,Sheldon,I know. It’s not fair. Let the anger go buddy. You just you relax all your muscles. Except for your pubococcygeus and anal sphincter. Let’s keep those tight.
9086,Raj,How do you do? Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali. Call me Raj.
9087,Sheldon,Two trains?
9088,Howard,Maybe. It’s a prime number. Encryption systems are built on prime numbers.
9089,Penny,Oh will you please let it go?
9090,Leonard,I’m sorry is that a yes?
9091,Sheldon,Of course not. I love you. I’m just embarrassed by the things you believe do and say.
9092,Penny,I don’t know it’s complicated.
9093,Sheldon,No. The vibration. We are directly underneath the geology lab and they’re running their confounded sieve shakers again. Hey gravel monkeys if you need to shake rocks try jiggling your heads around!
9094,Sheldon,Fine.
9095,Sheldon,How can you miss a game you’ve never played before silly?
9096,Leonard,I love you too.
9097,Leonard,Thanks. Tickets are eleven bucks. Not a date.
9098,Raj,You don’t know we’re wrong yet.
9099,Howard,I did. The guy at the liquor store said this stuff tastes great in coffee.
9100,Sheldon,Ugh. Stuart.
9101,Penny,Yeah I’m sure it was just the initial shock of it all.
9102,Howard,I was there. It was funny.
9103,Sheldon,Yeah that list is strong. Like your mother’s urge to be promiscuous with sailors.
9104,Sheldon,Or the first door closing causes a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.
9105,Leonard,You’re not being very nice.
9106,Leonard,I don’t know. I heard you reading pretty loud last night.
9107,Howard,Light beers? Well Wiki-how about that?
9108,Leonard,Hey.
9109,Leonard,Okay I got it I got it she’s not your girlfriend. Now listen to me. I know about loneliness. I know about trying to replace someone with other stuff. When I broke up with Penny I got back into my cello I built a bunch of model rockets I got those weightlifting gloves and that five-pound dumbbell.
9110,Raj,For your information Emily is working tonight.
9111,Penny,Yeah let’s you me and your very very pale feet make some art. Hey when you got back to this store I want to go with you.
9112,Raj,What you don’t say thank you?
9113,Raj,This is so generous of you I um I don’t know what to say.
9114,Leonard,Except for Raj.
9115,Sheldon,Well not only did we go to Skywalker Ranch we got in. And no one we know can say that. And for all the times you find me irritating today you got to watch someone shoot me with a Taser.
9116,Raj,Oh great. There go my chances of being sexually harassed.
9117,Sheldon,Well how would I know?
9118,Penny,I get that. Hey you want to just bring a few people in here? You know Wil Wheaton in the bathtub Batman on the toilet. It’ll be like the weirdest Comic-Con ever.
9119,Sheldon,If she doesn’t think that we should apply for this patent she’s being patently absurd.
9120,Leonard,I’m getting to it. 
9121,Sheldon,Of course. I’m already seeing a more efficient way of taming the ultravi… I know why the song was in my head.
9122,Sheldon,Under my authority as a self-appointed member of the Centres for Disease Control street team these premises are condemned.  Penny.
9123,Raj,Well uh to paraphrase Shakespeare It’s better to have loved and lost than to stay home every night and download increasingly shameful pornography.
9124,Sheldon,The two signals meet up in the corpus callosum and T equals zero. And I know a boy who just earned a slurp of soup.
9125,Sheldon,Yes. Leonard’s work is nearly as amazing as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels.  While I appreciate the oh snap I’m uncomfortable having your moist breath in my ear.
9126,Leonard,No this is my home now. Thanks to you my career is over and I will spend the rest of my life here in Texas trying to teach evolution to creationists.
9127,Leonard,Don’t worry you’ll find another job.
9128,Leonard,What if I knocked you unconscious right now?
9129,Penny,I’m sorry what?
9130,Howard,What was that?
9131,Penny,Yeah?
9132,Penny,Yeah I need to start cracking the window when I leave you in the car.
9133,Raj,You’re in a soup kitchen not a production of Oliver!
9135,Leonard,Check it out. Jim Lee drew this of me two years ago at Comic Con.
9136,Penny,Uh what what you got goin’ on here?
9137,Raj,I just never want to be a burden on my friends.
9138,Sheldon,Fine whatever works.
9139,Sheldon,You put me in charge of your finances. If you wanted someone weak and spineless you could walk all over you should have asked Leonard.
9140,Sheldon,I do. Leonard never cooks for me.
9141,Penny,Hey you guys ready to order?
9142,Sheldon,What’s the exchange rate.
9143,Sheldon,What a stupid question.
9144,Leonard,Let’s see Raj was the Kung Palo Chicken.
9145,Leonard,It’s like living with a Chihuahua.
9146,Raj,I don’t know if I’d say you… oh.
9147,Howard,Hey congratulations Bert.
9148,Sheldon,Well she’s due tomorrow. Although it did take her six years to finish high school so who knows?
9149,Raj,What? Just because I’m Indian I can’t be a Norse God? No no no Raj has to be an Indian God. That’s racism. I mean look at Wolowitz he’s not English but he’s dressed like Peter Pan. Sheldon is neither sound nor light but he’s obviously the Doppler Effect.
9150,Sheldon,I’ll add it right now. Oh baby it’s addendum time.
9151,Penny,It’s not funny.
9152,Sheldon,The line of scrimmage is the imaginary transverse line separating the offence from the defence.
9153,Sheldon,I don’t like this game.
9154,Sheldon,Bazinga! You’ve fallen victim to another one of my classic practical jokes. I’m your boss now. You may want to laugh at that.
9155,Penny,What? What are you doing back?
9156,Penny,Hi.
9157,Sheldon,It’s an observational rebuttal of the Lambda-CDM model of the universe.
9158,Penny,Well.
9159,Sheldon,Yes. Not sold separately. Although the PS4 uses cool new GDDR5 RAM while the Xbox One is still using the conventional DDR3 memory.
9160,Sheldon, Wil Wheaton! Wait how many was that?
9161,Sheldon,Oh please. The only way she could make a contribution to science would be if they resume sending chimps into space.
9162,Raj,Oh come on you can’t say oh my and then not tell me.
9163,Leonard,Thank you so much for letting us pick your brain.
9164,Howard,Hey guys.
9165,Sheldon,You know I apologise for my earlier outburst who needs Halo when we can be regaled with the delightfully folksy tale of the whore of Omaha?
9166,Sheldon,Can you?
9167,Penny,Yeah and I checked. Not letting the bike fall on you while standing still is lesson one.
9168,Sheldon,You guess? You don’t seem to have much of a handle on this.
9169,Penny,No it isn’t.
9170,Penny,Hey I know tons of people who got married in Vegas.
9171,Howard,What are you talking about? They’ve always known where you live.
9172,Sheldon,No that’s the least of our worries. I’ve been doing some research on addiction both the biochemical and behavioural aspects and I think there’s a problem with the current version of our lie.
9173,Raj,Well I do. Next to you I’ll look like a catch.
9174,Sheldon,Is it my fault I have a much bigger reputation than he does?
9176,Penny,Okay.  Okay yep we’re all done now. It’s just it’s good. Let me just take that away from you. Okay.
9177,Sheldon,March 18th. You violated my rule about forwarding email humour.
9178,Sheldon,Thank you for coming by gentlemen.
9179,Sheldon,Absolutely. But don’t be surprised if this movie sets you on the straight and narrow.
9180,Sheldon,What about Joss Whedon’s work makes you think he’d be okay with rule-breakers and line-cutters?
9181,Sheldon,I’m not crazy. My mother had me tested.
9182,Leonard,Good-bye Sheldon.
9183,Leonard,Doesn’t that violate the health code?
9184,Leonard,Why? I said I didn’t care.
9185,Howard,Excuse me I’ll be right back. Don’t go anywhere. Don’t move. Just stay the beautiful unspoiled American flower that you are.  What’s wrong with you dude that woman was all up in my jammy.
9186,Raj,Yeah I know you’re teasing but watch out for karma.
9187,Penny,Uh well it’s a little juvenile. I mean it kind of looks like the MySpace page of a 13-year-old girl.
9188,Leonard,Well he’s having a rough time. Amy broke his heart the DVR cut off the last minute of Doctor Who. That crow followed him home.
9189,Raj,Look let’s be reasonable. We all want to do different things with the ring but your ideas are stupid and I want a jet ski.
9190,Howard,But I’m Green Lantern.
9191,Leonard,I took a little lady I like to call loneliness.
9192,Penny,Oh. Go away Leonard.
9193,Leonard,Yes.
9194,Penny,You know sometimes I think I’ve made you so much cooler than you used to be and then you go and do that.
9195,Leonard,Hey.
9196,Leonard,Fine. Here I go taking one for the team. In the sack. Hey Leslie.
9197,Leonard,Oh that would be great.
9198,Sheldon,Ta-da. It’s short for da-da-da-da!
9199,Sheldon,Good. I thought she saw something on my forehead.
9200,Penny,Can you?
9201,Sheldon,Do you really think death threats are an appropriate way to begin this conversation? Sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me.
9202,Sheldon,Your mee-maw died? That’s terrible.
9203,Leonard,What? Is it wrong? Have you seen it somewhere else?
9204,Leonard,Well you know how you’re always saying that Amy is a girl who’s your friend and not your girlfriend?
9205,Penny,What? No no I just put it on the other hand and turn it around. Keep that hand in my pocket.
9206,Sheldon,Alright I think we’re going to need some ground rules in addition to the expected no shoes in the time machine and no eating in the time machine I propose that we add pants must be worn at all times in the time machine.
9207,Howard,Yes so I was just warming up some milk for Halley and I thought it smelled a little funky so I checked the date that you wrote on the bottle and it says Flerbsday.
9208,Sheldon,No. No if I can walk past that pet shop with the parrot in the window I suppose I can do this.
9209,Raj,But it’s true. But we-we put all your vital information into this dating site answered all their questions just like you would and they found a match for you. Her name is Amy Farrah Fowler.
9210,Penny,On a ship? Aren’t they afraid Hawking will just roll overboard?
9211,Penny,Oh hey. Sorry Sheldon I’ll move.
9212,Howard,Oh fun. Let me see. Uh no no uh definitely not.
9213,Penny,Yeah but you just have to remember that ride is shorter than you think and they take a picture of you at the end so make sure you got your clothes back on. It’s a joke. Based on real events.
9214,Leonard,If you’re not into this we can do it another time.
9215,Sheldon,Very impressive. You know when you’re done with that can you look at this? It doesn’t make smoke anymore.
9216,Raj,Oh. It’s wonderful and I swear I’m not saying that because Justin Timberlake is in it.
9217,Penny,You’ve been giving me a hard time and you haven’t even told your mom about Sheldon?
9218,Penny,I came to say I’m sorry.
9219,Penny,You know those girls text me every detail of their lives as it happens.
9220,Raj,Hummingbirds are pretty.
9221,Sheldon,See? Howard’s on my side.
9222,Raj,We still on for tomorrow night?
9223,Sheldon,No I can’t. I need to make preparations for Amy’s birthday. Which leads me to the following bit of business. This is my ticket to Star Wars. I don’t have to tell you it is worth far more than its face value of fifteen dollars and fifty cents. I trust you’ll give it to someone worthy.
9224,Leonard,Mrs. Latham the first machine I turn on in the morning is the helium-neon laser ’cause it needs to warm up.
9225,Sheldon,Would it be helpful to you if I told you about my dreams?
9227,Penny,Just walk.
9228,Penny,Oh so it’s like The View.
9229,Sheldon,Oh dear. I was afraid of this.
9230,Leonard,Oh come on no! We just bought the regular pack.
9231,Sheldon,Yeah of course you do. You’re a girl. You like all kinds of hippy-dippy things.
9232,Leonard,Yeah definitely better before.
9233,Howard,Good morning. Is there some new kind of casual Friday I don’t know about?
9234,Penny,Leonard I had an epiphany not a stroke.
9235,Sheldon,Oh I’m sorry that is what I meant.
9237,Leonard,Morning
9238,Leonard,Well it’s really not that fancy it’s just a city college.
9239,Leonard,You’re the only one who eats them.
9240,Penny,So you’re saying you’re not having sex with me you’re having sex with your mother?
9241,Leonard,Bernadette.
9242,Leonard,Really? How how’d we manage that?
9243,Sheldon,Great what is it?
9244,Leonard,You just shaved yesterday. You’re good for three months.
9245,Howard,Of course. I’d be happy to shred it on my ax.
9246,Penny,Oh.
9247,Penny,I don’t have iced tea and snickerdoodles.
9248,Raj,Party with the pretty girls dude!
9249,Penny,‘Cause let me tell you something buddy I pay my own way in this world okay? I don’t rely on anybody!  What was that about?
9250,Leonard,Hey.
9251,Sheldon,Well Mom if I did it would be conclusive proof that your God can work miracles.
9252,Leonard,You’re right I’m the problem I’m the one that needs help.
9253,Leonard,I told you there’s nothing to worry about.
9254,Sheldon,Meh. That poster of Halle Berry’s a little unnerving.
9256,Penny,As a rule no.
9257,Penny,Yeah to be honest I don’t see much difference.
9258,Sheldon,He doesn’t just put on a pair of glasses. He combs back his curlicue and affects a mild-mannered personality.
9259,Leonard,No you didn’t.
9260,Penny,Hey shouldn’t you be out with your gang spray painting equations on the side of buildings?
9261,Penny,No no no no I didn’t forget. Um there’s this cat in a box and until you open it it’s either dead or alive or both. Although back in Nebraska our cat got stuck in my brother’s camp trunk and we did not need to open it to know there was all kinds of dead cat in there.
9262,Penny,Okay. One of the things that might help you in connecting with your students is being a little more spontaneous. So why don’t we try some improvisation?
9263,Leonard,Going to Wheaton’s party is not betraying you.
9264,Sheldon,Yes. I think prolonged exposure to Penny has turned her into a bit of a Gabby Gertie.
9265,Raj,Okay. Okay thank you. Oh if she’s scared you can sing to her. She likes Katy Perry. Oh but don’t do Firework that gets her all riled up.
9266,Leonard,I know but…
9267,Sheldon,I see. Is that decision open for discussion?
9268,Leonard,Really? This is going to decide who’s the hero and who’s the sidekick?
9269,Sheldon,When I thought the element was real I didn’t want it. But now that Leonard made it not exist I want it more than anything in the world.
9270,Leonard,Yes. It’s all on you. But I got to tell you when the time comes I want the whole nine yards. I want you down on one knee flowers I want to be swept off my feet.
9271,Leonard,Oh my turn my turn.
9272,Sheldon,It’s all right. I’ll see it again with you.
9273,Penny,You’re in trouble.
9274,Sheldon,Richard Feynman played the bongos. I thought I’d give that a try.
9275,Leonard,What do you want?
9276,Sheldon,Oh we’re fine. As Howard advised she’s merely respecting our professional boundaries.
9277,Sheldon,That’s 14 hours away. For the next 840 minutes I’m effectively one of Heisenberg’s particles I know where I am or I know how fast I’m going but I can’t know both. Yet how am I supposed to carry on with this huge annoying thing hovering over my head?
9278,Raj,Oh actually that’s a Van Dyke. A goatee is just hair on the chin.
9279,Sheldon,Leonard I could use your assistance.
9280,Sheldon,Right. And which one do I want?
9281,Sheldon,I’m certain this will come as no surprise to you but Leonard is failing in yet another relationship.
9282,Penny,Yeah I’ll take you for ice cream.
9283,Sheldon,It doesn’t matter. That’s my spot.
9284,Howard,Oh yes Leonard. Yes it was.
9285,Penny,Yep.
9286,Raj,But I can use the downstairs bathroom right?
9287,Howard,Is that him over there?
9288,Sheldon,You clearly don’t. What my spineless friend lacks the courage to say is you’re a terrible person who took advantage of his tiny size his uncoordinated nature and his congenital lack of masculinity.
9289,Leonard,Dinner’s ready!
9290,Leonard,What did you write?
9291,Leonard,Nope.
9292,Sheldon,Penny implied the same thing. Is this true?
9293,Penny,Well maybe that’s ’cause Leonard can’t cook.
9294,Sheldon,Uh elephant?
9295,Sheldon,Ach why not? We’re already through the looking glass anyway.
9296,Leonard,She said shush. I should have shushed. 
9297,Leonard,Well so much for making up for the emotional wounds of childhood.
9298,Sheldon,I posted the last episode of Fun with Flags hours ago and not a single person cared enough to comment. All that effort for nothing.
9299,Sheldon,His name is Monte.
9300,Leonard,I repeat not gonna happen.
9301,Sheldon,And of course the answer is 130 adoseconds.
9302,Sheldon,I’m sorry I didn’t realize I was interrupting your morning prayers. When you’re done we’ll go.
9303,Penny,Sheldon honey I’ve told you it’s a small apartment you only have to knock one time.
9304,Sheldon,Right. 22. 
9305,Sheldon,I’m done hiding from bullies. I’m taking this into the real world.
9306,Penny,Fine but I’m telling you it’s terrible.
9307,Sheldon,I’m sorry but five people eating and chatting is a party.
9308,Raj,What are you a little kid? Is she gonna cut your dinner into little pieces too?
9309,Raj,Oh yes. Oh okay. Uh Good night. I don’t know maybe it’s the fumes from the urinal cakes but I feel like something is happening between us.
9310,Leonard,Laxative.
9311,Sheldon,Perhaps. Perhaps this restaurant’s now a front for organized crime. For all we know the mobster sauce contains actual chunks of deceased mobsters.
9312,Leonard,Yeah that’s when it started.
9313,Penny,Okay well you feel better.
9314,Penny,You got me. While you’re there could pick me up a few comics for my nephew’s birthday?
9315,Sheldon,Very well. Things between you and Penny have never been better. I hope four months apart doesn’t change anything. I should have opened with that huh?
9316,Leonard,Because you wouldn’t let me wear safety goggles.
9317,Penny,Mm-hmm.
9318,Sheldon,Something he wouldn’t buy for himself. Something fun. Something like… oh an 802.11n wireless router.
9319,Sheldon,I’m begging both of you please let’s go.
9320,Leonard,C’mon now throw one.
9321,Howard,I don’t know. I lost track and I missed my exit. So uh so what’s up?
9322,Sheldon,What does it say?
9323,Leonard,So that’s it? Wham bam thank you Leonard?
9324,Leonard,Couple of weeks.
9325,Raj,Why? Because you slept together and when she was done with you she discarded you like last night’s chutney?
9326,Leonard,Well there’s Joyce Kim but she defected back to North Korea so it’s a little geographically undesireable.
9327,Penny,That’s so great.
9328,Leonard,Still going to introduce him?
9329,Sheldon, Trust me we are not a couple.
9330,Penny,Oh really?
9331,Leonard,I don’t know. Sometimes your movements are so lifelike I forget you’re not a real boy.
9332,Leonard,We didn’t have to that was clearly a tangent. Now come on. Back to work. If we’re leaning towards quantum coupling… Aah! Why?
9333,Leonard,Hey where you been?
9334,Penny,Oh wow a girl scientist.
9335,Raj,My point is if I were a horse or a bird I’d be very nervous around James Cameron.
9336,Sheldon,I believe Alex may have unearthed the grade school science project that could be my ticket to the Nobel Prize. Behold.
9337,Raj,But you made the garage sound so fun.
9338,Howard,Can we not play this game?
9339,Penny,Your pants are ruined.
9340,Sheldon,I missed Comic-Con and the new Star Trek movie!
9342,Sheldon,Alright then. 
9344,Raj,I was really hoping to see a cattle drive.
9345,Penny,Mmm.
9346,Raj,What just happened?
9347,Penny,I wasn’t going to get alcohol. Gosh I wonder what Leonard’s doing right now. I miss him so much.
9348,Leonard,A solar system. Uh uh uh uh um unidentified flying liverwurst? I don’t…
9349,Howard,Technically it would only be rebound if he and Penny had actually engaged in physical intimacy.
9350,Penny,Hi. Hey where’s your fiancée?
9351,Raj,Ha-a-a. Still funny.
9352,Howard,Well put your mind at ease. I’m here to make sure your dinner party kicks Howard’s dinner party’s ass. Now the first thing we need is a theme. I’m thinking ah turn-of-the-century Moulin Rouge.
9353,Raj,But you’re a dentist he’s nuts.
9354,Raj,Dude there’s so many cool things we could be doing tonight. Look. At the Glendale Galleria put on your best zoot suit it’s a salute to Swing music in the center court near Macy’s. 5pm to 9pm huh huh? A salute to zoot. Sounds like a hoot.
9355,Raj,Thank you. Would you like to hear more about it in my hot tub? So when do I start?
9356,Raj,Okay I’ll start heating some of this stuff up.
9357,Raj,Uh w well okay look I I don’t want to lie to you. I got curious I was looking around and I broke the drawer on your night stand.
9358,Sheldon,Sea World is better. It has Shamu who is literally tons of fun. But for the moment let’s stay focused on Todd Zarnecki.
9359,Penny,‘Cause it’s stupid. Who cares what number it is?
9360,Sheldon,That’s my parking spot.
9361,Penny,Oh wait wait wait. Stuart didn’t get to speak.
9362,Leonard,It would be pretty awesome to hang out with him. I just used awesome wrong didn’t I?
9363,Leonard,Yeah that’s when it started.
9364,Sheldon,Yellow. Go ahead.
9365,Penny,Sheldon that’s not what girlfriends are for. Although you don’t use them for what they’re for so what do I know?
9367,Penny,Thank you Sheldon.
9368,Leonard,Yeah really.
9369,Raj,Can we please make a decision not only are there children starving in India there’s an Indian starving right here.
9370,Sheldon,My arduous journey however was for naught. Although advertised to appear he did not show up. It was at that moment I vowed eternal hatred for Wil Wheaton.
9371,Raj,No you don’t get it. I want nothing to do with any woman. My heart is stone. From now on I’m a monk. I renounce all worldly pleasures. Except for lobster. And garlic butter.
9372,Raj,Who’s this mysterious buddy you suddenly have?
9373,Leonard,I hate that you talk to him more than you talk to me.
9375,Sheldon,Unit cell contains two carbon atoms. Interior angle of a hexagon is 120 degrees.
9376,Sheldon,I’m fine.
9377,Leonard,Well we’re having everyone over.
9378,Leonard,I’m not doing it. You killed him you do it.
9379,Leonard,It’s the social protocol it’s what you do when you have a friend who’s proud of something they really suck at.
9380,Leonard,Now you’re helping them find ways to make us miserable?
9381,Leonard,Fine if Zack’s going to be Superman I want to be Green Lantern.
9382,Penny,I know it sounds like a cliché but compromise is key.
9383,Howard,Maybe so. But you can’t incinerate a Bengal Tiger with a magnifying glass.
9384,Penny,Did you know last weekend Priya took Leonard rollerblading at the beach? Can you believe that?
9385,Sheldon,And how did that make you feel?
9386,Sheldon,I don’t understand what we’re doing.
9387,Sheldon,It’s not my fault I’m bad at sharing I skipped kindergarten.
9388,Howard,Oh what a coincidence. Maybe you can discuss that with him while you’re playing in the tournament. Sign here.
9389,Leonard,But Raj is from India which means he’s no slouch at holding his breath.
9390,Penny,It didn’t come up.
9391,Howard,Yeah it is. And you know we get to name it.
9392,Raj,Well I don’t think you have to worry about Penny telling my sister that.
9393,Sheldon,I have a plan to work on both projects simultaneously. And for your information the summer conference on algebraic topology at Caltech is nerd prom.
9394,Leonard,Okay. I did not want to do this but I have here the rare mint condition production error Star Trek The Next Generation Geordi LaForge without his visor in the original packaging. If you do not get out of my way I will open it.
9395,Howard,Oh cool.
9396,Sheldon,Yeah those are men who just had sex.
9397,Leonard,Hey Kripke.
9398,Leonard,Let’s see a lever a lever.
9400,Leonard,Oh what a nice surprise. I don’t think you’ve ever seen my lab before.
9401,Raj,Boy I bet Ellen Pages friends aren’t giving her this kind of crap.
9402,Sheldon,Hey if you want someone to guess chocolate chip cookie you draw a glass of milk next to it.
9403,Sheldon,It is right behind do-do-do-do-do Inspector Gadget. and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles heroes in a half-shell.
9404,Penny,We have Chicken Tortilla and Potato Leek.
9405,Sheldon,No don’t.
9406,Raj,Exactly.
9407,Sheldon,She said buenas noches. What was he supposed to do?
9408,Penny,Yeah plus if you leave Alfred will know he got under your skin.
9409,Penny,The woman at the wall store?
9410,Leonard,Oh yeah he got a tuba.
9411,Howard,Oh but I bought Chinese takeout.
9412,Howard,Hold on. Sheldon is there ketchup on that table?
9414,Sheldon,Yes. My sister’s uterus came down with a baby.
9415,Leonard,Don’t make this hard for me.
9416,Sheldon,You know exactly what I need.
9417,Howard,Like us?
9418,Raj,That’s not the point.
9419,Raj,Okay how about uh on your mark get set go?
9420,Sheldon,Let me ask you this. Do you think this song is the music the white boy ultimately plays?
9421,Howard,Oh okay false alarm. Little parenting tip sleeping babies hate flash photography.
9422,Sheldon,All right name your price.
9423,Penny,I don’t know what to tell you. I mean why don’t you talk to her?
9424,Leonard,Yes I feel terrible about it. I will never forgive myself I don’t expect you to either and I would really appreciate it if you would leave me with Penny for a session of self-criticism and repentance.
9425,Raj,Just hear me out. I’m going to make you guys a scavenger hunt like they have at M.I.T.
9426,Leonard,Advantage Kim.
9427,Leonard,Some people go outside and do that.
9428,Howard,Nothing happened. Can we please just change the subject?
9429,Howard,With pleasure.
9430,Sheldon,Yes but you wouldn’t understand.
9431,Sheldon,The third floor landing. The poor old guy’s been walking up the stairs for half an hour. It’s really you.
9432,Leonard,That’s actually a valid example. Animals do deliver messages through scent.
9433,Leonard,I want to go.
9434,Penny,In my apartment while I was sleeping.
9435,Sheldon,Forgive me. Yiddish was not spoken in east Texas. And if it was it wasn’t spoken for long.
9436,Raj,It’s nice that all the people who are lonely on Valentine’s Day can come here tonight and be together.
9437,Sheldon,Why?
9438,Sheldon,Namaste.
9439,Howard,Marking the star positions and physical landmarks so we can find the house of the supermodels.
9440,Leonard,What?
9441,Raj,What kind of needs?
9442,Sheldon,Oh you’re welcome.
9443,Raj,Good story. 
9444,Howard,Sure. We’ve both been in his shoes. We’ll let him down with compassion and respect.
9445,Penny,Oh for God’s sakes.
9446,Leonard,You know when you talk like that I want to take you right here on this table.
9447,Leonard,Look at that in 30 seconds we went from hiring women to being them.
9448,Leonard,Yeah looks like there’s a big storm all up the East Coast.
9449,Sheldon,Oh. Well suit yourself. Who wants to check me?
9451,Howard,Yeah. He brought me back a T-shirt that said My Friend Went to the Space Station and All I Got Was This Lousy T-Shirt
9452,Penny,Really doesn’t matter to me how much he spent on the ring. I think.
9453,Sheldon,I can’t sleep. how are you going?
9454,Howard,Me.
9455,Penny,I can’t do it he’s my best client.
9456,Sheldon,Oh Oh Lord that multiplication error! He thought he carried the one. But he didn’t.
9457,Sheldon,Look I am simply going to defend our work scientist to scientist. And failing that suggest that his mother enjoys a string of both human and non-human lovers.
9458,Leonard,Say what?
9459,Leonard,Well then don’t go.
9460,Sheldon,You met her at Pasadena’s most popular Irish watering hole Lucky Baldwin’s where Maggie spends her nights tending bar with a head full of curls and a heart full of dreams.
9461,Penny,What so I’m the wrong person? Maybe you want to be with Gretchen too.
9462,Sheldon,Please hold all questions to the end of the presentation. This is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland the product of decades of planning and construction. It is a Mecca for physicists the world over. This is Bath and Body Works on Colorado Boulevard. They sell scented soaps and lotions some of which contain glitter. Now let’s see if we can match the individual to the appropriate destination.
9463,Sheldon,Well we’ll just see how long you can hold out.
9464,Penny,Come on that is ridiculous.
9465,Penny,I’m glad to hear it.
9466,Leonard,Oh yeah sure let me just put this in a travel mug.
9467,Penny,Oh my God would you just get off my case?
9468,Leonard,This is cool.
9469,Sheldon,Well regardless she has a distinct advantage in all tavern-based competitions. Pool beer pong wet T-shirt contests they’re all out.
9470,Penny,Hey you ready to go?
9471,Penny,Come on anything can happen. We can push him down the stairs.
9472,Sheldon,I shouldn’t have to see my girlfriend get groped in public by another man.
9473,Sheldon,Me?
9474,Sheldon,Thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the nineteenth century. Interestingly they don’t actually put the fork in their mouth they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth.
9475,Howard,Be there bright and early.
9477,Sheldon,But we didn’t see them bust one ghost.
9478,Howard,Great so I can take them both out with a number-two pencil?
9479,Leonard,Excuse me this whole idea is insane.
9480,Penny,Oh. I’m sorry.
9481,Penny,Just answer the phone.
9482,Howard,I know but that sounds anti-Semitic. Anyway I was thinking we could have a little film festival tonight. The theme movies that killed their franchises.
9483,Sheldon,This is a complex battle simulation with a steep learning curve there are myriad weapons vehicles and strategies to master not to mention an extremely intricate back-story.
9484,Sheldon,Mmm mmm mmm. That’s Eye-talian.
9485,Howard,Well I can’t eat like a ten-year-old all the time.
9486,Sheldon,Good. Now I assume we’re splitting the cheque?
9487,Sheldon,Penny?
9488,Leonard,You shut the loading doors right?
9489,Penny,Sure sure. Or we could take you to get a bikini wax.
9490,Leonard,Sheldon? Sheldon are you okay?
9491,Leonard,No if a man dresses as a bat that’s Batman but if Man-Man dresses as a bat that’s Batman-Man.
9492,Howard,Okay I don’t have it all worked out yet but I was thinking something like um Oh Indy oh Indy the skies are so windy. Is that a flying man with a killer bod? Wait that’s no man it’s a Norse god.
9493,Raj,Disappointed? Let down?
9494,Penny,Leonard…
9495,Howard,Says I was talking too much about dating Claire and Emily and I accused him of being jealous.
9496,Leonard,Wow that’s brilliant.
9497,Sheldon,Oh not at all. I’ve had outings with Leonard and Raj in the evening and oh I had lunch
9498,Leonard,He’s working on a paper about nano vacuum tubes and wants to know if I’d take a look at it.
9499,Sheldon,I am going to record this for posterity.
9500,Penny,Oh that’s nothing.
9501,Sheldon,Really? Uh little tip jokes are often better when you end them with wocka wocka or ha-cha-cha.
9502,Penny,No.
9503,Leonard,Aye aye Captain.
9504,Penny,I wonder if it’s from like ancient Rome where they’d actually chop somebody’s ass off and then go here. You know to appease Loseroneous the god of losers.
9505,Raj,Nevertheless this will be reflected in her tip.
9506,Howard,We were badass back in the day.
9507,Sheldon,A beloved character from an Indian folk tale.
9508,Penny,What is he doing now?
9509,Leonard,Do me a favour lean over put your head right here.
9510,Penny,Maybe you don’t I do. What’s the deal?
9511,Leonard,Making pretty good time huh?
9512,Sheldon,How can it be okay? Stephen Hawking’s a genius and he talks like a robot. It’s everything I’ve ever wanted in a friend.
9513,Leonard,What are you talking about?
9514,Raj,Me too. Oh look we’ve got enough ketchup to cover every ounce of it.
9515,Raj,Our pleasure.
9516,Sheldon,Well if it isn’t Wil Wheaton the Jar Jar Binks of the Star Trek universe.
9517,Leonard,Wait are you saying that he discriminated against you? Because we should file a complaint.
9518,Penny,Oh my God Leonard! That’s incredible!
9519,Penny,I don’t always defend Sheldon.
9520,Raj,Yeah but what if the experiment works?
9521,Sheldon,Amy do something. Amy help. Amy stop that. Amy Penny both of you stop it.
9522,Howard,It’s even got the Elvish engraving on it.
9523,Penny,Ugh You’re right who cares? Mm. Get that money out of my back pocket or I will break your fingers.
9524,Sheldon,Yeah this is an auspicious moment. Yeah like Robert Oppenheimer or Neil Armstrong we need the appropriate words to mark this historic scientific event.
9525,Sheldon,Thank you. I’ve also sent Amy a relationship termination notice and changed my cell phone number and e-mail address.
9526,Raj,More wine?
9527,Sheldon,Oh of course. An nondescript white panel van. You may be familiar with it from the sentence their bodies were found in a nondescript white panel van.
9528,Sheldon,Hey. What are you trying to pull? The president of science isn’t in here.
9529,Leonard,Okay uh look you just need to get your mind off it. Do you want to go to the comic book store? Maybe go see a movie?
9530,Sheldon,Well we could argue about who said what all night long but to set things back on course I will propose a new topic of conversation.
9532,Sheldon,What are you looking at you stupid squirrel?
9533,Penny,Yeah which means we don’t have to use his ridiculous ornament-spacing template.
9534,Leonard,I don’t want to talk about it. There the place is all yours.
9535,Howard,No you can’t join us. Just go go climb back up whatever beanstalk you came down from.
9536,Leonard,Nevertheless I’d like to get one on the record so you can understand why I did what I did.
9537,Sheldon,It doesn’t matter. You can’t possibly win.
9538,Howard,That’s nice. I haven’t had much success meeting people online.
9539,Penny,I’m settling once and for all who is the smartest around here. Okay are you ready?
9540,Penny,Fine you want me to call? I’ll call. Why am I so nervous?
9541,Sheldon,How are you settling in?
9542,Raj,What do you want?
9543,Sheldon,Leonard your wife is sitting right here. What are you doing?
9544,Howard,You’ll be happy I did. Okay little one here we are back at home because you weren’t quite ready to come out yet. You wanted to make an entrance. I get it. And here’s your daddy. When he tries to tell you he used to be cool you can see he wasn’t.
9545,Sheldon,Oh fine. Then I’ll just hang out with Wolowitz.
9546,Penny,Yes it is.
9547,Sheldon,Well I wonder if anyone’s tried that.
9548,Leonard,Uh yeah sure.
9549,Penny,So Leonard will we be seeing you on Saturday for your free birthday cheesecake?
9550,Howard,That’s not him.
9551,Leonard,That’s true. Sheldon’s father once picked a fight with a cactus.
9552,Penny,No no no no no no you are my boyfriend. Nothing you do is silly to me.
9553,Sheldon,What did the toaster oven ever do to you?
9554,Raj,Can I just stay in the garage?
9555,Penny,Ooh.
9556,Leonard,Please tell me you didn’t use Amy’s magic juice.
9557,Leonard,Anyway I know it’s silly but since Raj moved in I’ve been feeling a little left out.
9558,Penny,‘Cause he’s scared of you?
9559,Sheldon,Great restraint on my part.
9560,Sheldon,You have to get rid of the chair.
9562,Penny,Raj.
9563,Leonard,Howard what are you doing?
9564,Penny,Yeah. Why wouldn’t I want to get my old job back? It’ll be fun to see everyone. I haven’t talked to them since I said I quit see you at the Oscars bitches. Come on let’s just get this over with.
9565,Leonard,What do you want.
9566,Leonard,Come on. I take care of him all day long. You do it for once.
9567,Leonard,Kind of busy here Sheldon.
9568,Sheldon,I seem to be a few tickets short. Are there more in the box?
9569,Howard,Amen to that. Sometimes I pour a little chardonnay into my dog’s water bowl.
9570,Leonard,I’m trying. Don’t yell at me.
9571,Leonard,Hey.
9572,Leonard,Well we’re not gonna tell him I did it.
9573,Penny,Well no I mean your king is trapped. He can’t go here because of my lighthouse and he can’t go here because of my pointy-head guy.
9574,Howard,Then you leave me no choice. I accept the job.
9575,Sheldon,Thank you. Lift with your knees not your back. Good night.
9576,Leonard,It’s also a problem because we don’t even know if the aliens who find this can see. I mean they might communicate in a totally different way than us.
9577,Leonard,Ahoy matey.
9578,Sheldon,All right let’s do this Bert? We need to talk.
9579,Howard,Ooh it’ll be like a reunion then. Sign here.
9580,Penny,Oh it’s beautiful.
9581,Sheldon,Leonard be glad you can’t keep a woman. They are a handful.
9582,Sheldon,When we’re sleeping she breathes on me. One night it got so bad I almost grabbed Toto
9583,Sheldon,It wouldn’help. The human body is capable of being flatulent for hours after death.
9584,Penny,So what’s new in the world of physics?
9585,Sheldon,Are you still mad at me?
9586,Leonard,Come on snipers.
9587,Sheldon,It was you.
9588,Raj,Yeah it’s a crushed velvet baby cape.
9589,Leonard,Okay sorry.
9590,Leonard,Leave it alone. That’s my girlfriend.
9591,Penny,Well the first few weeks will be all training. They’ll tell me everything I need to know.
9592,Penny,You went to the dirty store without me?
9594,Penny,Yeah.
9595,Raj,Hey guys what’s up?
9596,Raj,Well you can’t stay with me I have a teeny tiny apartment.
9597,Leonard,And you as well Mr. Our-Premise-Is-Intriguing.
9598,Sheldon,That lady has a name. I don’t know what it is but one time I accidentally called her mom.
9599,Penny,Sheldon where are my clothes?
9600,Sheldon,In my present it’s in the future. In your present it’s been crammed in the bedroom by an enterprising young man I met in The Home Depot parking lot.
9601,Leonard,Oh yeah sure. There’s also an amazing documentary about building a dam on river in South America.
9602,Leonard,Yeah. I worked hard on that speech too.
9603,Penny,A homunculus?
9604,Leonard,I haven’t seen him this stuck since he tried to figure out the third Matrix movie.
9605,Sheldon,That’s a temporal anomaly. Corn dogs didn’t come into existence until the first half of the twentieth century.
9606,Raj,I think we should take a picture to capture this moment.
9607,Howard,Okay first off I want to thank you all so much for coming. Howard is here to interpret for Emily and to take notes.
9609,Sheldon,Oh that one’s mine.
9610,Raj,Any question but that.
9611,Leonard,Yeah it’s weird. Even though he didn’t want to give the lecture in the first place being rejected by those students really hit him hard.
9612,Penny,I’m still sleeping with you tonight.
9613,Penny,Oh that that’s so cool. How do you how do you turn that thing off?
9614,Sheldon,It could be the most inspired combination since I mixed red Icee into my blue Icee. It was like drinking two sevenths of the rainbow.
9615,Howard,Like really a million?
9616,Sheldon,Yes I have. And my only conclusion is the prescription he was picking up the other day was for cuckoo pills.
9617,Penny,Yeah a little tip he says he can eat frozen yoghurt. Do not believe it.
9618,Leonard,I give up.
9619,Sheldon,Must be out of range.
9620,Leonard,How come it’s not a party when we do it here?
9621,Sheldon,Well wealthy means a lot of money and vastly means even more. I’m not sure what’s tripping you up.
9622,Sheldon,Uh-huh. And an irrational constant.
9623,Sheldon,I know! It’s not enough is it? Here.
9624,Howard,Really? What was I doing to your neck last night while you were playing X-Box?
9625,Sheldon,Penny would have to go into my room.
9626,Raj,Ooh I call Kermit.
9627,Penny,How?
9628,Penny,And no regrets.
9629,Sheldon,And begin.
9630,Leonard,Hello?
9631,Penny,Your facebook status update. Leonard Hofstadter is in a relationship.
9632,Howard,You know it it’s bad enough that I have to deal with this…
9633,Sheldon,I can still eat.
9634,Howard,Boy it wasn’t this hard with Bon Jovi. I said you rock he said thanks man and that was that.
9635,Penny,Yeah. Shoes I’m a seven-and-a-half boots I’m an eight.
9636,Penny,Sheldon we have to go.
9637,Penny,Way off.
9638,Raj,I told you she exists.
9639,Howard,Thank you.
9640,Howard,We’re being ridiculous. There’s no way a woman that attractive is trying to seduce Sheldon Cooper.
9641,Leonard,You didn’t have to scoop vomit out of your glove compartment.
9642,Penny,No we don’t! Come on in!
9643,Leonard,Well to be truthful…
9644,Penny,Decent? I make twice what you make.
9645,Raj,What’s Plan B?
9646,Penny,We’re not in a rush. We’ll set a date when the time is right.
9647,Raj,And Amy you need to be patient with Sheldon instead of pressuring him to accept intimacy on your terms.
9648,Leonard,Oh oh Beekeeper to King 12. I capture your Pope and release the swarm. Checkmate on Sheldon.
9649,Leonard,You want it you got it oh you want it baby you got it
9651,Sheldon,Wait.  Put this in the bathroom.
9652,Penny,Relax we got time this is so fun.
9653,Leonard,She told me that you went behind my back to guilt her into letting you go instead of her.
9654,Sheldon,Well then no problem I have three controllers the more the merrier.
9655,Sheldon,Then surprise me.  Would you call that moss green or forest green?
9656,Leonard,I thought you grew up on a farm.
9657,Penny,Yeah I gotta put a sticker over that. So uh you must be devastated about your divorce.
9658,Leonard,I want to invoke the girlfriend pact Howard.
9659,Penny,Okay wait. What are we doing?
9660,Howard,It has more food too.
9661,Howard,Oh come on I brought you one too.
9662,Raj,When did you take my blood?
9663,Leonard,Okay I got to I I I I got to ask. What makes you think that your relationship is so wonderful and ours isn’t?
9664,Howard,Yes.
9665,Leonard,If you must know Penny won a spa weekend from work and she’s taking me.
9666,Sheldon,For your information I’ll be playing host to Dr. Elizabeth Plimpton.
9667,Penny,Or we could just wing it.
9668,Leonard,Guys please don’t make this a school project where I’m the smart kid doing all the work while the slackers sit back and watch.
9669,Sheldon,No. You went pfft. What does pfft mean?
9670,Sheldon,But they’re not blonde so put on your wig. Hello?
9671,Sheldon,Gentlemen.
9672,Sheldon,Really?
9673,Penny,I guess so. And I’d finally get to live alone with my husband.
9674,Sheldon,When are we going to get robot eyes?
9675,Sheldon,Do you remember how upset I was when they replaced Edward Norton as the Hulk?
9676,Sheldon,I don’t. I’m not even sure if that’s a person or a typo.
9677,Sheldon,Name it.
9678,Leonard,He was a jerk because you rear-ended him.
9681,Penny,Look you did the right thing last night. I was a mess. I was just frustrated because my career is going nowhere.
9682,Penny,Okay. I get it. I mean not all the jibberjabber in the middle but I know what it’s like to put your heart and soul into something and get nothing out of it.
9683,Leonard,W-W-Wait what’s going on?
9684,Raj,Well she was pretty mad. For all I know it’s a voodoo doll of me with a fork stuck in my junk.
9685,Raj,What we’re ready when I say we’re ready. Uh-du-du-du ooh okay now we’re ready.
9686,Penny,Of course you already knew that when you bought me this princess-cut drill bit.
9687,Leonard,Priya and I are in love. I think we could get married someday.
9688,Raj,But dude you’re so lucky. Getting to stay home at night with the woman you love.
9689,Leonard,Yeah I don’t want something dumb like money to come between us.
9690,Sheldon,Well then Raj and I will…
9691,Leonard,Do it. Visualize it as your anger and and toss it out of your life.
9692,Howard,Do you have a preference?
9693,Penny,Hi. What would you recommend as a present for a 13-year-old boy?
9694,Leonard,I take it back. That was funny.
9695,Raj,That’s what he said to me.
9696,Penny,Are you going to let me talk?
9697,Howard,‘Cause that’s what we do.
9699,Sheldon,Oh I hardly think so.
9700,Leonard,You can do this.
9701,Sheldon,Ah very good. Because a gorilla go-go dancer of any sexual preference would be out of place in a film about the Holocaust.
9702,Sheldon,Department of motor vehicles new driver handbook? But I don’t have a problem.
9703,Howard,That’s it we’re dead.
9704,Sheldon,No thanks. We’re fine. I mean if you people want to eat at the table then that’s what you should do. I like eating down here because this is how we’ve always done things. But if those days are gone they’re gone. It just makes me sad.
9705,Sheldon,It reminds me of when my stupid brother and sister would build forts in the living room and wouldn’t let me in. I hated that so much.
9706,Sheldon,What? No. You mean this was all a ruse? Oh how could I be so stu… .
9707,Leonard,Mm Joyce Kim was kind of curious about what I did for a living and I was going to kind of show it to her. It’s not important. The point is the guys and I went back to the apartment.
9708,Leonard,Well we had started binge-watching Luke Cage together and it was kind of our thing and then I find out that she watched two episodes without me.
9709,Penny,No.
9710,Sheldon,Get it?
9711,Sheldon,I think you mean positive punishment. Negative reinforcement is the removal of a positive stimulus. It’s a common mistake.
9712,Leonard,Oh. I forgot about this. My aunt made it for me when I started college.
9713,Sheldon,I can’t.
9714,Howard,Well it’s it’s possible it was tracking everywhere you went.
9715,Penny,Do you want to stop? I know you have trouble with eye contact.
9717,Penny,Yes. You’re right. I should just say I’m done with him.
9718,Leonard,Hmm? How much you got?
9719,Howard,Well what if something were to happen to this boy so he was no longer a threat to Sheldon?
9720,Leonard,It sounds like either way I finally get some rest.
9721,Penny,Yeah that’s when I started thinking about work. Uh listen I’ve got some good news.
9722,Raj,We just got back from that exhibit of those plasticised human cadavers.
9723,Sheldon,You wore it the night we went ice-skating. Remember?
9724,Sheldon,I needed advice about a woman. I would have asked you but if the last few years have proven anything it’s that you can’t tell a uterus from a unicycle.
9725,Penny,Are we so sure that’s a bad thing?
9726,Sheldon,Yes Infinite Sheldon defeats all other cards and does not violate the rule against homemade cards because I made it at work.
9727,Sheldon,No no no. It’s your birthday. As long as no one jumps out in a hockey mask I’ll be fine.
9728,Sheldon,Au contraire.
9729,Raj,Howard’s capsule should be re-entering the atmosphere any minute.
9730,Leonard,Yeah. Just thought I’d come down and start getting ready for swimsuit season.
9731,Howard,Do that. See?
9732,Leonard,So?
9733,Sheldon,Just when I think I’ve gotten the hang of sarcasm.
9734,Sheldon,Leonard you are my best friend. I’ve known you for seven years and I can barely tolerate sitting on the couch with you. Imagine my attitude regarding prolonged physical proximity to Amy Farrah Fowler.
9735,Penny,Thank you. Would you be willing to go to my psychic and see what it’s all about?
9736,Leonard,No.
9737,Leonard,All right well after we talked about my issues with my mother nothing too deep just how she ruined my life I told her about you and your drug. She said she’d be happy to meet you.
9738,Sheldon,Focus is important. Was Michael DeBakey a wedding planner in between heart transplants? Did Alexander Fleming moonlight as a hairdresser? “Thanks for discovering penicillin now how about we try a bouffant?”
9739,Leonard,And he wrote him a cheque.
9740,Raj,Any questions?
9741,Leonard,I’m sorry were you talking to me?
9742,Sheldon,And Raj.
9743,Sheldon,Well why not?
9744,Leonard,What uh the kissing and everything? Nah women do that to me all the time.
9745,Leonard,Hi Mom. I have some exciting news.
9746,Raj,Yeah knock it off Howard.
9747,Leonard,Yeah I see that. Shouldn’t you be at work?
9748,Leonard,Sheldon we haven’t won a game all night. Now you either stick your face in that pie or I’m gonna stick that pie in your face.
9749,Penny,Uh do you have any questions?
9750,Howard,Okay everybody and plie. And relevae.
9751,Sheldon,What is it?
9752,Raj,Hey we agreed when it was Eureka time we were all gonna say it together.
9753,Penny,Oh I always tear up when the Grinch’s heart grows three sizes.
9754,Sheldon,Of course. Here here let me. I’ve been doing a little research on New Jersey and I was delighted to learn that their chief agricultural product is sod.
9755,Howard,H-h-h-how did we get on me we were mocking Leonard for not moving on. Dude you have totally not moved on.
9756,Penny,I’d rather people not know I have any prior connection to you whatsoever.
9757,Penny,She’s thinking of taking a job at The Cheesecake Factory.
9758,Penny,You ever going to sleep with Amy?
9759,Leonard,He asked me.
9760,Leonard,I really do.
9761,Sheldon,Well once. When I was fifteen and spending the summer at the Heidelberg Institute in Germany.
9762,Sheldon,And yet you wound up in traffic court. Anyway if it would please the court I’d like to begin with an opening statement.
9763,Sheldon,In anticipation of their arrival I’ve bagged some evidence. One of the thieves had the audacity to quench his thirst while ransacking our home. You should be able to pull some good prints off this. And now here are my prints so you can rule me out as a suspect.
9764,Leonard,And you were right about my motives I was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny that might have some day led to sex.
9765,Penny,Yes yes your spirit guides are on fire.
9766,Sheldon,I know everything about this stuff.
9767,Sheldon,She’s been conducting an experiment on apes where they’re given various puzzles to solve. I was surprised at the complexity of the puzzles and thought some humans wouldn’t be able to solve them. That’s when Amy said want to make this interesting?
9768,Sheldon,See people get it.
9769,Penny,You’re welcome. Don’t worry I didn’t forget about you. Leonard I got you a label maker.
9770,Sheldon,Allow me to comfort you. At least you’ve got your health.
9771,Sheldon,Be a lamb and check.
9773,Leonard,Uh yeah I’d love to.
9774,Penny,Okay. Marsha Jan and Cindy were the three daughters of what TV family?  The Brady Bunch. Okay Sammy Hagar replaced David Lee Roth as the lead singer in what group?
9775,Raj,How dare you ambush my girlfriend at the gym!
9776,Leonard,Sorry. How did it go?
9777,Leonard,I have 26 hundred comic books in there I challenge you to find a single reference to Kryptonian skin cells.
9778,Penny,What’s this?
9779,Leonard,You’d better go before he starts spraying you with Lysol.
9780,Raj,Come and get it.
9781,Howard,May I have a grasshopper with a little umbrella please?
9782,Leonard,Hey aren’t you having breakfast?
9783,Leonard,I found it but it’s empty.
9784,Sheldon,‘Sup? My apologies. I would’ve been here sooner but the bus kept stopping for other people to get on it.
9785,Sheldon,I don’t want another parking space. I want my parking space. It’s perfect. It’s a corner spot cutting the risk of door-dings in half. It’s a mere 28 steps from the building entrance. The nearby tree provides shade on hot days and is also home to a delightful squirrel. Which is fortuitous because most squirrels are real jerks.
9786,Penny,Yeah now about those uh they came from a costume shop and all they had left was sexy graduate so they might be a little short.
9787,Leonard,Look you know I love you but but you’re you’re drunk and sad and feeling lost.
9788,Leonard,With Penny and me it took two years. Now that I think about it that was three dates.
9789,Sheldon,You overestimate his significance in my life.
9790,Leonard,Come on don’t get upset.
9791,Penny,You’ll never guess what just happened.
9792,Raj,Anything can happen.
9793,Leonard,In retrospect that was clue number two.
9794,Howard,You have to admit it’s a pretty smooth ride.
9795,Penny,Helium.
9796,Leonard,Oh right your name. That makes more sense than penis.
9797,Sheldon,It’s an iCal download she can put it right in her phone. And I thought we agreed that you’d have your conjugal visits in her apartment.
9798,Raj,What you told her?
9799,Howard,Wait a minute. Hey let me see your phone.
9800,Raj,It’s very simple. For breakfast she has an egg-white frittata. Feel free to give her a choice of home fries or an English muffin but not both. We’re watching our weight. Uh for dinner something simple a veal chop some scampi whatever you like.
9801,Sheldon,He’s engaging in reductio-ad-absurdum. It’s the logical fallacy of extending someone’s argument to ridiculous proportions and then criticising the result and I do not appreciate it.
9802,Raj,Oh I know why don’t we get started on clearing out the baby’s room?
9803,Raj,Does anyone have any words they’d like to say about our man of the evening?
9804,Leonard,Sheldon you just can’t dictate…
9805,Leonard,You do that?
9806,Howard,Oh thanks man.
9807,Penny,What’s that?
9808,Raj,Very nice. You lie to my sister.
9809,Howard,Hey got a minute?
9810,Howard,Oh can I show her an oil painting I made of us surrounded by our children and grandchildren?
9811,Leonard,I’m not going to engage in hypotheticals here I’m just trying to be a good neighbour.
9812,Raj,When you come back to Earth in a Soyuz capsule you free-fall from space at 500 miles per hour and the only thing that slows you down is a little parachute that pops out right before you crash into the ground. And the whole thing was designed by the same brilliant minds who were unable to capture Rocky and Bullwinkle.
9813,Howard,I’m from New Delhi. Maybe you should find another entomologist.
9814,Penny,It’s Friday night that means Chinese food and vintage video games right?
9815,Penny,Will do.
9816,Sheldon,Agreed.
9817,Leonard,You know the best part of working in the clean room? No allergies. Check it out. Oh that that that’s a lot of oxygen.
9819,Raj,Oh sure.
9820,Sheldon,Well we were on our way to my mother’s house…
9821,Raj,Ooh maybe we could come up with a business plan to compete with this place.
9822,Penny,Hi.
9823,Leonard,Penny’s here.  No we don’t want to watch Bridget Jones’s Diary!
9824,Leonard,Well well we might want to live together.
9825,Penny,Good! Go! There are some girls right over there. What are you waiting for?
9826,Sheldon,When does a monkey have a trunk?
9827,Leonard,You shush I’m happy I want to talk about it. You know what my mother would say about this? She would say because you were not loved by your father and I was not loved by my mother that having sex is our way of making up for the intimacy we didn’t get as children.
9828,Howard,But you don’t have sex with her either.
9829,Leonard,No no. You gave me an explanation it’s reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers.
9830,Sheldon,Yes. Now when the robots rise up they’ll know that I’ve been rooting for them the whole time.
9831,Sheldon,Well that’s certainly a thought-provoking hypothesis. May I suggest it as the topic for your essay.
9832,Leonard,It just said Italian sub. I had no idea mortadella has pistachios in it.
9833,Sheldon,Y No. I’m as much a part of this relationship as you two and I think it’s high time we put all our cards on the table. For example where is this going? Are you two ever getting married? And if so where will we all live? Have you thought about that?
9834,Sheldon,You’d hit particulate soil on a colloidal suspension. Mud.
9835,Leonard,What happened?
9836,Raj,No.
9837,Leonard,Yes I’m upset.
9839,Leonard,You bought that? Great. I got to call her before I forget how I said it. Hey.
9840,Sheldon,I weep for humanity.
9841,Penny,Oh I really appreciate this. I just hope I’m not in over my head.
9842,Sheldon,Never. I’d rather see Monte dead than in your hands.
9843,Leonard,We’re gonna be here foreever.
9844,Sheldon,You tell me. I feel like I can’t breathe and I am tempted to crack you open and suck the air right out of your lungs.
9845,Sheldon,But someone might spoil the movie. No one can spoil Amy’s birthday for me. Surprise she’s even older. Who saw that coming?
9846,Sheldon,I’m going to run around outside with a wet head and try to catch a cold.
9847,Leonard,Sheldon she just got off the plane. She doesn’t want to cook.
9848,Leonard,Hang on are we talking about murdering Dennis Kim? I’m not saying no.
9849,Sheldon,I see. Take me to Leonard.
9850,Sheldon,Fire demon.
9851,Raj,I hate trains.
9852,Howard,Boy you cannot catch a break can you?
9853,Leonard,I killed his Chewbacca slippers.
9856,Howard,What?
9857,Sheldon,Perhaps not. But it is a way to speak to a woman who quoted the Bible to me my whole life and then desecrates one of Ethan Allen’s finest sofas.
9858,Sheldon,Even though the menu description specifies shredded?
9860,Penny,No it’s all right. Walk me down. So what’s up?
9861,Sheldon,Well he doesn’t say it’s a good game.
9862,Leonard,Thank you. This drink is a wonderful example of how liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical container. Thank you.
9863,Raj,No no. I will take care of it.
9864,Raj,I can actually feel the toxins being pulled out of my skin.
9865,Leonard,Oh. How’s it going?
9866,Penny,Yeah well I bet her laundry room wasn’t down five flights of stairs. You know giving really is better than receiving. I used to think it was such a cliche but it seems to be the… oh look at these cute jeans someone just threw away.
9867,Sheldon,Is it that the glucosinolates which give mustard its flavour were evolved by the cabbage family as a chemical defence against caterpillars?
9868,Howard,It’s sad that you know that.
9869,Sheldon,My problem is that I don’t want you to break Leonard’s toy which you probably did by shaking it. She shook it. We all saw her.
9870,Sheldon,Many years ago. Back when she was a grad student. She’s always been a huge fan of my work and now she’s doing research at Caltech.
9871,Penny,Mm-hmm. Hmm.
9872,Sheldon,I promised Penny.
9873,Sheldon,Actually much better.
9874,Leonard,Well now that you can focus again what do you say we get back to surface tension of domain walls?
9875,Leonard,It’s just a blackout I’m sure the power will be back on soon.
9876,Penny,I guess.
9877,Sheldon,I know and I do yearn for faster downloads but there’s some poor woman is going to pin her hopes on my sperm what if she winds up with a toddler who doesn’t know if he should use an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve.
9878,Sheldon,Knock-knock.
9879,Raj,Uh excuse me.
9880,Leonard,I was thinking we could work on this at night and then maybe in a couple of weeks we’ll have ourselves an app to sell.
9881,Howard,It’s a re-writable CD. Just put it in.
9882,Raj,Lame characters with silly ac… what kind of actress are you?
9883,Raj,Wow that’s rough. Where’d you get that?
9884,Leonard,Do you want an allergy pill? ‘Cause I have ’em all. Prescription nonprescription foreign domestic experimental.
9885,Sheldon,That is the prevailing opinion.
9886,Howard,All right. Uh would would it be okay for me to see her? We’re usually in bed by now and I want her to know that I’m here. Yes we sleep together and sometimes we spoon.
9887,Sheldon,Can I have tea with honey and toast with the crust cut off?
9888,Raj,What? You slept with my sister?
9889,Leonard,That’s what I was doing.
9890,Penny,What?
9891,Raj,Okay.
9892,Raj,So you’re a dental student? Hmm are you aware that dentists have an extremely high suicide rate? Not as high as say air traffic controllers but then there are far more dentists than air traffic controllers so in pure numbers you’re still winning.
9893,Leonard,Chilli cheese fry?
9894,Sheldon,I knew we should’ve never mentioned us living together in the first place.
9895,Penny,What?
9896,Penny,Well if I would have been there and saw you alone I would’ve asked you to dance.
9897,Sheldon,More to the point it’s about finding a way to keep Leonard and Stephanie together.
9898,Penny,Mm-hmm. Anything else?
9899,Raj,Sheldon?
9900,Howard,I don’t want to watch Saturn 3. Deep Space Nine is better.
9901,Sheldon,Fair enough. It’d give you the right to rule a replica of England.
9902,Sheldon,Right now somewhere a woman is dividing the atomic weight of the best noble gas by the number of colours in the oldest national flag still in use.
9903,Sheldon,Well it was the two of you who found Amy Farrah Fowler for me. Now that I’m looking for my next girlfriend it seemed only logical that I employ your services once again.
9904,Penny,Please.
9905,Sheldon,I’m sorry I was aiming for your heart.
9906,Raj,Oh. You poor thing. You have one arrow in your quiver and you just can’t use it. Fortunately another pathway to a man’s heart is through his stomach.
9907,Sheldon,Jeepers I’m drunk.
9908,Penny,You’re a pig Howard.
9909,Howard,No ma’am.
9910,Penny,Okay.  Sometimes I feel like I can control the killer gorilla instinct inside of me but then I see these bananas and I just want to eat them and then kill people. What am I gonna do?
9911,Leonard,You called my mother?
9913,Sheldon,Fine. I’m mad at you. Not only did you ruin Raiders for me you may have ruined the whole franchise. Except for the fourth one which was bad before you got your mitts on it.
9914,Sheldon,She was old and blind Leonard. What choice did we have?
9915,Penny,Really? It didn’t work for you.
9916,Penny,No. We’re always doing what you guys want. Just once it’d be nice if you did something we wanted.
9917,Penny,Well is it or isn’t it?
9918,Raj,There was.
9919,Penny,It’s okay if you say no.
9920,Howard,Alright uh fine I’m coming and I’m bringing somebody. Uh Koothrappali plus one.
9921,Howard,Open it.
9923,Sheldon,You distract me. I’ve been distracted since the moment I met you.
9924,Sheldon,Come on Leonard I am spoon-feeding this to you.
9925,Penny,Good night. That was weird even for him.
9926,Penny,So how’s the food here? Oh wow that is really really good. Oh I’m sorry. You guys are on a date. We can hang out anytime. Have fun.
9927,Howard,Well and I ate all the crumb cake. We both made mistakes.
9928,Leonard,Yeah. Why?
9929,Penny,What’s yours?
9930,Sheldon,All right. Hmm huh I’m sorry I’m finding your reckless nonchalance regarding the check-engine light to be very troubling.
9931,Howard,I thought it was funny.
9932,Raj,That’s great.
9933,Raj,That had nothing to do with Rachel. It was an overreaction to a bad zipper injury.
9934,Raj,Dude this is this is brutal.
9935,Sheldon,I don’t see why I have to worry. My career’s not hanging in the balance. That was a joke. It’s funny because it’s true.
9936,Sheldon,You know who else said that? Every cocky T. Rex currently swimming around in the gas tank of your car.
9937,Sheldon,Interesting do you know where the phrase jibber-jabber comes from?
9938,Howard,You were in the middle of an erection.
9939,Howard,More wine?
9940,Sheldon,Okay now see you look sincere but your words are completely false. I’m glad we did this test run these brunches are wild.
9941,Penny,If you were this upset why didn’t you say so when I told you?
9942,Penny,Great.
9943,Sheldon,You lied to me?
9944,Howard,Yay.
9945,Leonard,Well uh not far. Hey if you ever wanna start a family La Cañada has some great schools.
9946,Sheldon,Yeah I picked it up without thinking about it. Which raises a neuroscientific question when did I decide to pick it up?
9947,Raj,It was the only way to keep you from being such a huge Dickensian. You see that? I added the ensian.
9948,Sheldon,Well perhaps when your mother gets here she’ll talk some sense into you.
9949,Sheldon,Legoland is not the solution to everything. And it’s too much of a scene since that movie came out.
9950,Penny,I did your horoscope remember I was going to do everybody’s until Sheldon went on one of his typical psychotic rants.
9951,Sheldon,All right. These are the talking points for my NPR interview tomorrow. I need to make sure that they’re simple enough for the less educated in the audience to understand. Howard look this over and tell me what’s unclear to you.
9952,Sheldon,Are you suggesting I terminate my relationship with Amy?
9953,Sheldon,You also made a common grammatical mistake you said nauseous when you meant nauseated. But go on.
9954,Sheldon,Why are you up?
9955,Sheldon,Hello.
9956,Penny,Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.
9957,Leonard,What is this?
9958,Howard,Got it. Now uh I have a question about the song. I was thinking at some point I could bust out a little rap.
9959,Sheldon,Wow I’m on fire tonight.
9960,Sheldon,You’re the teacher.
9961,Sheldon,Now don’t be insulted. He just thinks too much of you would be mind-numbingly tedious.
9962,Sheldon,Please please I don’t have a lot of time. Look Ramona finally dozed off and I need you to help me get rid of her.
9963,Raj,Yeah it’s the highest rated one on the market. I wouldn’t even call it a crib I’d call it a Fortress of Solitude for babies.
9964,Sheldon,I won! This is astonishing. Not that I won the award no one deserves it more. Actually I guess I misspoke. It’s not astonishing more like inevitable. I’m not sure what to do first. Maybe I should call my mother. Wait! I know I’m going to conduct an interview with myself and post it online.
9965,Leonard,Since when?
9966,Leonard,Well they argue all the time. They aren’t that close.
9967,Leonard,Buddy I am ready to drive you into the wilderness any time you want and leave you there.
9968,Howard,Okay. I’ll leave. But just know every time I come in here I’ll be thinking of you.
9969,Leonard,Well if that was a movie I would go see it.
9971,Raj,Okay well let me just tell you if we were having this argument in my native language I’d be kicking your butt.
9972,Leonard,And you were so good in the TV commercial.
9973,Raj,Nothing bad happens in The Lake House.
9974,Penny,So are you and Leonard working on an experiment together?
9975,Leonard,If it were your head it would be.
9976,Howard,Come on dude. This is my sister you’re talking about.
9978,Raj,Yeah you should have burned it down years ago.
9979,Sheldon,Hello Leonard do you like my bongos? Bet you didn’t know that I had bongos.
9980,Raj,I like to boogie.
9981,Howard,N-n-n-nothing happened to me.
9982,Penny,Yeah. No one wants to see that. Hey how about skinny dipping at the beach?
9984,Sheldon,Yes! This party just became a major rager.
9985,Sheldon,Oh it’s just a meeting. One simple meeting.
9986,Penny,No.
9987,Sheldon,Leonard it’s two in the morning.
9988,Raj,Right yeah right. But what do you think?
9989,Penny,No look Sheldon’s cousin Leo escaped rehab and he’s in a Motel 8 at Long Beach the whole family’s going out for an intervention. Leonard is driving Sheldon down there to help him through this because he’s such a good man.
9990,Sheldon, Penny?
9991,Howard,It has been a while since I got my prostate checked.
9992,Leonard,Oh Sheldon changed the password. It’s now Penny is a freeloader. No spaces.
9993,Leonard,Sheldon you know that if you stay up all night you’re gonna be sleepy tomorrow. And a sleepy Sheldon is a cranky Sheldon. And a cranky Sheldon is actually no different than a regular Sheldon. Good night.
9994,Leonard,To the bedroom.
9995,Leonard,A tribe of Abra-Comanches.
9996,Howard,There’s a 200-watt uninterruptible backup power supply.
9997,Penny,Do I look okay?
9998,Raj,Go ahead make fun. You can’t embarrass me I’ve got a beautiful girlfriend and a dog who loves me so much she drinks my bathwater.
9999,Sheldon,Mohammed is the most common first name in the world Lee the most common surname. As I didn’t know the answer I thought that gave me a mathematical edge.
10000,Leonard,Wow.
10001,Sheldon,You? No you’ll only make it worse.
10002,Leonard,Hey Priya.
10003,Penny,What?
10004,Penny,Honey instead of worrying about pain you might cause in the future how about trying to fix the pain you’re causing her right now?
10005,Sheldon,So no more interviews?
10006,Penny,She’s upset. Look it’s gonna be a great wedding. Look at you in your little suit.
10007,Sheldon,Sure. It’s not like I was invited to Richard Feynman’s house and have anything better to do.
10008,Sheldon,That’s no reason to cry. One cries because one is sad. For example I cry because others are stupid and it makes me sad.
10009,Sheldon,I think I’ll eat my lunch at home.
10010,Sheldon,Its weight and smoothness along with the slight concavity of the mirror means it can spin for a long time.
10011,Howard,Wouldn’t you feel better about yourself if you were more independent?
10012,Sheldon,Oh and how.
10013,Sheldon,Yes exactly I had a great time. That’s done I’ve moved on to other things. For example after I learn Finnish I’m not going to learn Finnish again.
10014,Penny,Wow. Can they?
10015,Leonard,If he were any bigger he’d have moons orbiting him.
10016,Penny,Yes he said he was feeling guilty and wanted to do what was right.
10017,Sheldon,I wouldn’t.
10018,Leonard,There are a couple of things I did with Penny that might be a little silly but…
10019,Penny,Sheldon.
10020,Sheldon,Ay-yi-yi.
10021,Howard,But we’ll have sex first right?
10022,Howard,Well you start off by trying to make chocolate souffle and when it falls you panic quickly change the name and voila! Lava cake.
10023,Leonard,I might kill him right now.
10024,Sheldon,I see. Well I assume since the rest of you have set the bar so low you’re saving the most impressive contribution for last. Go ahead Howard. Dazzle me.
10025,Sheldon,well no no I need something more permanent to join these papers. Say don’t you keep staples in your top desk drawer?
10026,Howard,Very well.
10027,Sheldon,Leonard?
10028,Raj,She’s gonna know I was looking in it.
10029,Sheldon,No.
10030,Sheldon,Careful it’s addictive.
10031,Leonard,It only gets funnier when you explain it Sheldon.
10032,Penny,Your what?
10033,Howard,You’d have no girlfriend to see you naked you’d try to fill the void with food and I’m an enabler who once deep-fried a pancake.
10034,Howard,The housekeeper does the shopping.
10035,Howard,Well if you leave now you can be back before the gorillas rip the crap out of Charlton Heston.
10036,Penny,So yeah anyway that’s my boyfriend. He is really smart.
10037,Sheldon,Who eats them horizontally?
10038,Raj,But I’m always on Howard’s team. We’re best friends. The kind who finish each others…
10039,Howard,What am I looking at?
10040,Leonard,Neat. Good work. Sheldon we’ve got to call this off.
10041,Sheldon,Where does he work?
10042,Sheldon,I’m behind you. Please look at me when you’re talking to me.
10043,Leonard,Shh-shh-shh-shh. Sheldon’s asleep. What’s going on?
10044,Leonard,Hang on Sheldon. How could you not tell me your sister was moving back to India?
10045,Howard,Well even if the study’s nonsense I don’t believe in tempting fate. Same reason I wouldn’t use a Ouija board or pick a fight with an Asian guy. He probably doesn’t know karate but why risk it?
10046,Penny,Yes. If it means that much to you you should go.
10047,Sheldon,You’re welcome Leonard.
10048,Sheldon,I wish I’d never gone on that trip. I feel no better now than when I left.
10049,Howard,Hey guys.
10050,Sheldon,My point is I don’t like when things change. So regardless of your feelings I would like you to continue dating Leonard. And also while we’re on the subject you recently changed your shampoo. I’m not comfortable with the new scent. Please stop this madness and go back to green apple.
10051,Howard,If it’s okay with you I’d like to go to temple.
10052,Raj,No you can’t join us. Just go go climb back up whatever beanstalk you came down from.
10053,Leonard,Hey how’d it go?
10054,Leonard,Howard every Thai restaurant in town knows you can’t eat peanuts. They see me coming they go “ah no peanut boy!”
10055,Sheldon,Excellent choice.
10056,Penny,Sheldon you can have a nice Thanksgiving anywhere. I spent one in Vegas.
10057,Leonard,Hysterical!
10058,Leonard,So why are you trying to ruin it?
10059,Sheldon,I need your advice about a delicate workplace situation. Uh to protect those involved I’ll be changing their names.
10060,Raj,Why do you care so much? You’re dating my sister and Penny and I are in love.
10061,Howard,Well I’m going back to India. What’s your plan?
10062,Sheldon,You know how the PennySaver only has my name…
10063,Howard,Sorry it’s not part of my heartwarming and personal narrative in which a humble boy from New Delhi overcame poverty and prejudice and journeyed to America to reach for the stars.
10064,Leonard,Howard and his mother are at the hospital. Come on we gotta go.
10065,Leonard,Congratulations. You’re officially one of us.
10066,Penny,Sheldon.
10067,Sheldon,Will they Leonard? 
10068,Sheldon,Another reason to consider a life of piracy. Even today I understand that’s an all-male profession.
10069,Penny,You know she seems very nice.
10070,Sheldon,Then how can I say it convincingly?
10071,Howard,We’re both frauds.
10072,Sheldon,Oh no I wouldn’t care for that. Amy?
10073,Sheldon,I suppose it has something to do with your recent passing.
10074,Sheldon,Uh let me ask you this. When I learn that I’m a robot would I be bound by Asimov’s three laws of robotics?
10075,Sheldon,But mostly here.
10076,Raj,Too bad I called dibs.
10077,Sheldon,Yes Lucky.
10078,Leonard,Bam. Right in the nose. Made me proud to own a PC.
10079,Raj,With sex.
10080,Raj,So what do you guys think that’s about?
10081,Raj,Let’s go home. You want to get something to eat?
10082,Penny,Okay I’m sorry honey but the Wesley Crushers sounds like a bunch of people who like Wesley Crusher.
10083,Howard,Okay then.
10084,Leonard,Uh right.
10085,Howard,Oh pish on your issues. You guys are fine. Yes you hit some bumps along the way. I mean Penny you’ve always known how this man has felt about you but you made him grovel for affection.
10086,Sheldon,A month? What? Are you kidding me? That would have been a good time for you to soften the blow.
10087,Sheldon,Hello.
10088,Penny,What do they have Wii cricket now? That can’t be very popular.
10089,Penny,Why would you say that?
10090,Leonard,I don’t understand.
10091,Sheldon,Okay I see so not a DVD burner.
10092,Raj,My my. The plot like my gravy thickens.
10093,Penny,Just don’t take it.
10094,Sheldon,It’s a Band-Aid at best. See the core problem is that Amy and Wil do not like each other. Which is baffling because they’re both crazy about me. And I like them which indicates they’re bright and interesting and/or were on Star Trek.
10095,Howard,No one was writing me back so I stopped checking my profile.
10096,Leonard,Okay we saw them. Can we go catch the movie?
10097,Leonard,Any other questions?
10098,Penny,Did you get my mail.
10099,Sheldon,I think you’ll like the drill tonight. I’ve tried to make it fun. Each of these cards contains a detailed scenario of a possible apocalyptic event. Everything from wild fires to a surprise invasion by Canada. Pick a catastrophe any catastrophe.
10100,Leonard,He was the host of this great… Hey!
10101,Sheldon,No but three two and we’re done is incomplete. You know those things bother me. It’s like hearing da-da-da-da-da-dah without yelling…
10102,Penny,Sheldon we have to go.
10103,Sheldon,Now where were we? Oh yes. Does anyone have any wood? Oh come on! I just want wood. Why are you making it so hard?
10104,Howard,Sure.
10105,Penny,So we didn’t actually…
10106,Howard,No hi Raj? No how are you Raj? Just straight to where’s the other white guy?
10107,Sheldon,Oh you’d like to catch up on the events of the day. All right. Well there was a half-hour wait at the bank to get into my safe deposit box I was forced to talk to Penny about your sexual problems and oh yes in a moment filled with biblical resonance pride wenteth before my fall causing my Flash 123 to goeth to Wolowitz.
10108,Sheldon,Leonard Penny wants to exploit any residual feelings you have for her in order to get a ride to work.
10109,Howard,It’s true you’re both gorgeous. Kind of says something about the man who could bed you both. You get why I’ve been alone most of my adult life.
10110,Penny,Oh sorry. We’ll keep it down.
10111,Sheldon,The humorous implication being that I am Wile E. Coyote?
10112,Howard,Oh she’s meeting us here. Hey guys do me a favour and don’t ask too many questions about the relationship. We’re just keeping it casual.
10113,Penny,Yeah okay great. Can we just get this over with?
10114,Leonard,I’ll go talk to her.
10115,Penny,Oh my God. Tell me what did I do?
10116,Howard,Speaking of untouchables I’ve got great news for you guys. People magazine is having a reception this Saturday and I managed to get you invited.
10117,Penny,Look I was just coming over to talk to you.
10118,Raj,Cool. All right friend.
10119,Leonard,Buddy I I get that you’re worried about me and I I appreciate that but I’m not going to die.
10120,Penny,I do I’ll teach you.
10121,Penny,Mm-hmm.
10122,Sheldon,Excuse me. I don’t know who you’re chanting for as I am currently the ball.
10124,Penny,Ooh ooh ooh angry?
10125,Leonard,So the guys and I were talking about renting a party bus and everyone going to Vegas.
10126,Penny,Hello.
10127,Leonard,Nailed it.
10128,Sheldon,They expect me to give a speech at the banquet. I can’t give a speech.
10129,Penny,You still worried some Berkeley girl is gonna steal him away?
10130,Sheldon,And Radio Shack.
10131,Howard,It means doo-doo.
10132,Penny,Uh-oh.
10133,Penny,Well I’m sorry Leonard it’s very hard to feel sympathy for you.
10134,Raj,No it’s fine. It’s not that big a deal. As long as they’re happy I’m happy. And when I get to see them for the holidays I’ll get to celebrate Diwali twice one at each house. That’s double the Diwali.
10135,Penny,Okay when I’m done with him I’m gonna need more information.
10137,Leonard,S-Y-F-Y. Sy-fee.
10139,Penny,You’re sitting here playing video games all day.
10140,Sheldon,Well it’s a new day. I have a new outlook. You know I realized I don’t need to worry about other people. I just need to think more about myself.
10141,Sheldon,Or instead of me.
10142,Penny,Oh that’s rough.
10143,Leonard,Forget the parties.
10144,Penny,Yeah right in there. She ate it and everything.
10145,Howard,When did you learn how to change a tyre?
10146,Sheldon,He could’ve softened the blow.
10147,Leonard,Anyway we can e-mail and I think the phone connections are pretty good.
10148,Leonard,What’s new at the Cheesecake Factory?
10149,Leonard,What if he lives in your garage?
10150,Sheldon,All right. You’re an actress. I need you to teach me.
10151,Howard,Just be honest. You don’t like it.
10152,Penny,Why did you have to make him happy?
10153,Sheldon,I hardly think so. You be sure and say hello to all the mosquitoes bees bears snakes possums poison oak oh and last but not least teenagers with guitars.
10154,Leonard,Wu-uh do you have some sort of a job?
10155,Penny,Raj you don’t have to serve us.
10156,Penny,Oh imagine that.
10157,Sheldon,Oh yeah.
10158,Raj,Well you must have someone in your family that’s a lawyer.
10159,Howard,Hey I don’t even live here.
10160,Penny,Look I’m sorry I didn’t text you back. I just needed some time to think.
10161,Sheldon,I know I may have started off with a fairly obvious one. You did an aspect of my most appealing trait playfulness. Why don’t you just go ahead and write that number 1. I’m afraid you’re on your own for the rest. It should take you no more than 3 hours.
10162,Sheldon,So that’s all this day was? A plan to butter me up before delivering bad news?
10163,Sheldon,Congratulations on a successful live show.
10164,Raj,Uh okay let’s see. They’ve got spicy food and there’s a chance you’ll get diarrhoea.
10165,Leonard,You know what? There is one thing I would like.
10166,Sheldon,Ladies ladies please. We’re not here to talk about Penny okay? We’re here to talk about me. Uh I mean Einstein Von Brainstorm. Oh darn it! All right I guess the cat’s out of the bag. Let me explain what’s going on. Ricardo is really Leonard.
10167,Howard,So uh what game are you… Oh. Crap.
10168,Leonard,What’s up with the infrared cameras?
10169,Sheldon,Really? That seems rather short sighted coming from someone who is generally considered altogether unlikable. Why don’t you take some time to reconsider?
10170,Howard,He gave me his business card and asked me to please pass it along to Howard.
10171,Leonard,Does it have melon on it?
10172,Sheldon,Uh Alex a moment. I need a word with Dr. Hofstadter. Do you think it’s appropriate for her to sit with us given her station?
10173,Raj,Well hey you’re my dear friends. You’ll get a Christmas card for a couple of years and then you’re dead to me.
10174,Penny,And sometimes we marry them anyway.
10175,Howard,Face it dude Bernadette treats you the same way your mother used to and that was not a healthy relationship.
10176,Penny,What’s the difference?
10177,Raj,You did what you had to do. 
10178,Howard,You brought your mother into this!
10179,Leonard,Oh. Well you know just being myself really.
10180,Sheldon,I’m not going to pay a fine. That would imply I’m guilty.
10181,Sheldon,Hang on. 130 over 80. A little high. We can attribute that to the stress of sneaking past the security desk.
10182,Leonard,Hey there’s no reason for you to be scared.
10183,Sheldon,It was in my weekly e-mail blast. Right between beet season is finally here and uh-oh red stool from beets leads to cancer scare.
10184,Sheldon,That’s odd.
10185,Sheldon,Leonard I’m dying.
10187,Howard,I’d rather have Fishbine’s it’s bigger.
10188,Penny,Yes.
10189,Penny,Oh hey if you guys are free this weekend I won a night of wine tasting from work.
10190,Leonard,Why didn’t you tell me you knew Elizabeth Plimpton? I am a huge fan of hers!
10191,Sheldon,Are you sure? Every time my dad stayed out all night my mom would put hamster poop in his chewing tobacco.
10192,Sheldon,Wear loafers. Look at Dr. Saul Perlmutter up there clutching that Nobel Prize. What’s the matter Saul? You afraid someone’s going to steal it? Like you stole Einstein’s cosmological constant?
10193,Leonard,It’s a joke.
10194,Leonard,Not really.
10195,Leonard,You made Frodo pancakes?
10196,Leonard,Jerry?
10197,Sheldon,Is someone there?
10198,Sheldon,What people?
10199,Penny,So who’s the girl?
10200,Leonard,Like what? He’ll never be able to cope with the fact that some fifteen year-old kid is smarter and more accomplished than he is.
10201,Raj,No no. Please don’t cry.
10202,Penny,Me too.
10203,Penny,I know you’ve been giving me secret puzzle tests.
10204,Leonard,It gets better. Instead of me you can take someone who will actually enjoy it.
10205,Penny,Oh for God’s sake just come to the play.
10206,Howard,Thank you.
10207,Sheldon,You’re talking to one of the three men in the Western hemisphere capable of following that train of thought.
10208,Sheldon,No one likes a know-it-all Penny.
10209,Howard,Oh don’t take it so personally maybe your baby’s just a jerk.
10210,Sheldon,Of course. We’re coming as the Justice League of America.
10211,Sheldon,What? I’m annoying? You criticize my behaviour all the time. Sheldon don’t talk about your bowel movements over breakfast. Sheldon when the president of the university is giving a eulogy at a funeral don’t yawn and point at your watch. Sheldon don’t throw away my shirts ’cause you think they’re ugly. You’re impossible.
10212,Howard,We do?
10213,Sheldon,Be sure to check the mail.
10214,Howard,I don’t think we’re going to do that.
10215,Raj,Thank you but cute is for bunnies. I want to be something with sex appeal like like a labradoodle.
10216,Sheldon,Don’t. It’s terrible. However in it we learn that when Spock finds himself drawn off the path of logic by feelings bubbling up from his human half he suppresses them using the Vulcan mental discipline of Kolinar.
10217,Penny,I kind of did. The part in that awful horror movie I passed on came back around. Apparently it’s mine if I want it.
10218,Sheldon,Four questions. There answer’s four.
10219,Raj,How did that even happen? Did they know that’s what they were doing when they were doing it?
10220,Sheldon,I don’t understand my food. Chinese noodles with Korean barbecue in a taco.
10221,Raj,By staying here and watching the movie.
10223,Leonard,I can’t hear you I’m in the shower.
10224,Sheldon,So it was working.
10225,Leonard,Really not a good time.
10226,Sheldon,Oh that’s a rather earthy cologne. My uncle used to wear that. Perhaps we can enjoy one last meal together before Leonard returns.
10227,Leonard,I want to say something obnoxious but it is easy on the eyes.
10228,Sheldon,Interesting that you ask. The Coast Starlight recently added the refurbished Pacific Parlour Car. Built in 1956 and originally known as the Santa Fe Lounge Car the lower level is a theatre…
10229,Sheldon,You have to check your messages the leaving of a message is one half of a social contract which is completed by the checking of the message. If that contract breaks down then all social contracts break down and we descend into anarchy.
10230,Leonard,So no on the Shepherd’s Pie. Can we move on?
10231,Sheldon,To Sheldon sorry this took so long. Your friend Wil Wheaton.
10232,Sheldon,Of course there is. The Mini Cooper ’cause it’s me.
10233,Raj,Yeah grow up Howard. God.
10234,Leonard,Sheldon are you going to introduce us?
10235,Leonard,Yup she’s right. For every Newton who had a psychological issue there’s an Edison who was just a jerk. That could totally be you.
10236,Sheldon,Well that means not one or not any. Maybe instead of a table you should buy a dictionary. Well I don’t know if I won that but at least he’s upset.
10237,Leonard,Yeah I’m good.
10238,Raj,And I was wondering if any of you guys would like to help me do it.
10239,Sheldon,When I was five I ingested a Z gauge locomotive. I spent the next three days saying I think I can pass it I think I can pass it I think I can pass it.
10240,Penny,Oh I am. Maybe if you follow this trail you’ll see why.
10241,Howard,Thor said that’s a nice look in nineteen fourty-foura.
10242,Howard,Um no.
10243,Sheldon,My point is if Koothrappali is moving on to a new life of shallow undeserved fame perhaps this is an opportunity to create a better cohort.
10244,Sheldon,You know I’m given to understand that there is an entire city in Nevada designed specifically to help people like Howard forget their problems. Where  you can replace them with new problems such as alcoholism gambling addiction and sexually transmitted diseases.
10245,Leonard,Yeah.
10246,Leonard,Come here.
10247,Howard,I’m impressed. This is very lifelike.
10249,Leonard,I just got here.
10250,Leonard,Okay. I know I propose a lot. So how about this? I promise I will never ask you to marry me again.
10251,Leonard,For one thing you live with your mother.
10252,Penny,Oh yeah right. Wait what was your problem again?
10253,Penny,Sheldon didn’t heckle him?
10254,Penny,No it’s not okay. Look at me okay? I took a temp job as a waitress forever ago and I’m still doing it. I can’t quit because guess what? I can’t do anything else. And I finally get my big break and it goes away. I’m such a mess.
10255,Raj,I should say so he appears to be a member of the Nigerian royal family.
10256,Leonard,Here you go.
10257,Leonard,No. I got upset. And Sheldon made me a beverage too.
10258,Howard,Just leave! Okay now. This is the way it’s supposed to be. Men together fighting the forces of evil.
10260,Leonard,Oh my God it’s seven.
10261,Leonard,Sheldon hang tight. Hey do you want me to bring anything?
10262,Howard,Not now Leonard Michaela’s inviting me to a party. You better call the moon and you make sure that they have a bed for you.
10263,Howard,You should go to my girl. She’ll knock out those sideburns for free.
10264,Leonard,I’m sorry. You’re pretty I’m stupid. Hello. Uh just checking again for Hofstadter. Still gonna be an hour?
10265,Penny,So you’ve really never had a birthday party?
10266,Howard,Is that true?
10267,Penny,That did not clear things up.
10268,Sheldon,Ooh I don’t think so. No anecdotal evidence suggests that in the game of rock-paper-scissors players familiar with each other will tie 75 to 80% of the time due to the limited number of outcomes. I suggest rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock.
10269,Sheldon,He’s right. I say we call this person back. We’ve got no reason to hide.
10270,Leonard,I was sleeping.
10271,Penny,Oh. Hey Sheldon.
10272,Leonard,I have to say this is the best Top Ramen you’ve ever made.
10273,Penny,What do you mean vastly wealthy?
10274,Sheldon,Hello.
10275,Raj,You guys don’t have to go to the trouble. I’m back in the money now I can just buy another helicopter.
10277,Leonard,Which is why I got you this Pink Power Ranger. Put it anywhere you like.
10278,Sheldon,Nailed it.
10279,Leonard,Sorry Sheldon it’s just not a good time for playing games.
10280,Leonard,Mm-hmm International Space Station. 250 miles that way.
10281,Sheldon,Yay!
10282,Penny,Sheldon I really don’t want to talk about this with you.
10283,Sheldon,Yes. That’s what a rational person does when his entire life’s work is invalidated by a post-pubescent Asian wunderkind. He ceases his fruitless efforts he donates his body to scientific research and he waits to die.
10284,Leonard,You want to drive?
10285,Leonard,Sure.
10286,Sheldon,No  that’s ridiculous.
10287,Sheldon,It’s pretty convincing huh? And it wasn’t even a real person. And here is the clincher. A lock of Maggie’s flaming auburn hair.
10288,Sheldon,Nope.
10289,Leonard,You’re right I’m sorry. Let’s watch the game.
10290,Leonard,What do you mean?
10291,Leonard,How could you miss that?
10292,Howard,It is. He stopped trying to find Indian girls for me to marry.
10293,Sheldon,Well perhaps you’re obsessively picturing him engaged in drunken coitus with another woman. Is that it? Did I get it right?
10294,Penny,He spent the entire night bragging about how he invented the word appe-teasers.
10295,Sheldon,What? That was ambiguous.
10296,Penny,Look at you talking sports.
10297,Penny,I don’t want to talk about it.
10298,Penny,I don’t know. Be cool. He’s coming. He’s coming. Hi.
10299,Sheldon,I didn’t try I succeeded. For some reason it alarmed the other passengers and I was asked to de-bus.
10300,Leonard,How about those two?
10301,Raj,Well I think the first thing we should get rid of is that tone.
10302,Sheldon,Last night I was strong-armed into an evening of harp music and spooning with an emotional Amy Farrah Fowler. This on a night that I had originally designated for solving the space-time geometry in higher-spin gravity and building my Lego Death Star. And why? Your gal pals Penny and Bernadette went out shopping for some wedding nonsense without Amy an action they took with no thought or regard as to how it would affect me the future of string theory or my Lego fun time.
10303,Howard,Hey.
10304,Raj,No.
10305,Penny,Get out.
10306,Raj,Hey guys bad news. I just did a quick calculation. Given the size of the theatre  and the length of this line we might not get seats.
10307,Raj,Mmmmmm.
10308,Howard,It’s like when you bought that remote-controlled helicopter and it just flew away.
10309,Penny,Yes?
10310,Leonard,Don’t worry about the moon. We we set our laser to stun.
10311,Leonard,Even Batman breaks the rules.
10312,Sheldon,Your apology is accepted.
10313,Howard,Oh yeah? Can you do this? 
10314,Leonard,Hey. I thought you were with your new buddies.
10315,Howard,I did. It was beautiful.
10316,Raj,You really think so?
10317,Sheldon,Mom smokes in the car. Jesus is okay with it but we can’t tell Dad.
10318,Sheldon,I know. The group consensus is that his proposal will be met with an humiliating soul-crushing rejection. Everyone was set a-twitter. Although oddly no one tweeted.
10319,Penny,There’s a can in the fridge.
10320,Sheldon,Well make your jokes but some of the participants who spent four days in the woods away from all technology reported a fifty percent gain in reasoning skills upon their return.
10321,Leonard,That shirt brings out the blue in your eyes.
10322,Sheldon,I did.
10323,Penny,Okay you don’t have to say struggling every time. You can just say actress.
10324,Sheldon,They do some of their best work at night.
10325,Sheldon,This is an interesting topic. How many sexual encounters have you had?
10326,Raj,Dad I’m trying to tell you off and you’re ruining it with your delight and relief.
10327,Penny,Now open your hand and let it go.
10328,Leonard,Perfect.
10329,Leonard,What kind of emergency?
10330,Raj,I’m very comfortable here. Penny dear why don’t you shoot another silver bullet my way?
10331,Penny,Hey can you help me put some of the food out?
10332,Leonard,You call Koothrappali we need to find a place to lay low for the next eighteen to twenty four hours.
10333,Sheldon,So we slept together naked. It was only to keep our core body temperatures from plummeting.
10334,Sheldon,I’ve found an emulator online that lets you play classic text based computer games from the 1980s.
10335,Howard,Oh yeah she’s got puddles in all the right places.
10336,Howard,One ladder left.
10337,Raj,I like the new look.
10338,Leonard,I can hear your voice coming from your bedroom.
10339,Penny,We’re going to Disney World and ride the Matterhorn?
10340,Penny,Thinly veiled contempt.
10341,Raj,For you or with you?
10342,Raj,Have you ever heard of the Kama Sutra?
10343,Raj,Oh okay okay my turn. Are you in the six Star Wars movies?
10344,Sheldon,All right if you must watch then mute it with closed captions please.
10345,Leonard,I thought Amy was gonna drive you home.
10346,Penny,She was right you know. The locus of my identity is totally exterior to me.
10347,Raj,Are you sure? He’s tall pale and awkward. That sounds like your type.
10348,Sheldon,Hmm? Oh I did. It hasn’t stopped. I figured out a solution for our navigation system while I was pre-soaking lentils out of my pants.
10349,Sheldon,Okay first talking to you while you’re on the toilet isn’t exactly a picnic for me either okay? Remember when you can hear me I can hear you. And second you completely disregard how uncomfortable unresolved issues are for me. It’s it’s like a an itch in my brain I can’t scratch.
10350,Sheldon,Well maybe what’s in my pants will change your mind. It’s a list of this year’s panelists. It’s long isn’t it?
10351,Sheldon,Are you able to have sex with men without developing an emotional attachment?
10352,Leonard,Graduate work very impressive.
10353,Raj,I’m calling her. And the threesome didn’t deserve the belly laugh it got.
10354,Sheldon,So for all the times I’ve offended you and all the times that I’ll offend you in the future I’m sorry.
10355,Sheldon,Golly she sounds too good to be true.
10356,Raj,Boy all this standing’s making me tired. Good thing I brought my collapsible stick chair.
10357,Sheldon,Oh she is. She’s terrific and she’s proving to be a valuable roommate.
10358,Raj,Give it up dude you’re arguing with a crazy person.
10359,Leonard,Just say Leonard went to the office.
10360,Sheldon,Yeah. And you never will. Ooh hey oh ask her to do the tissue thing. Do it ask her.
10361,Howard,Plus no one stole their pants.
10362,Penny,Really? Why?
10363,Leonard,It’ll be good to have him back.
10365,Sheldon,Night. If we did continue living together would it be here?
10367,Howard,Anyway uh as I was saying I was at a pretty low place in my life and uh if it wasn’t for friends
10368,Sheldon,Now of course my 9am is your noon so let’s avoid the whole good morning good afternoon minefield and let’s just say hello.
10369,Penny,Vegas here we come.
10370,Howard,Party with the pretty girls dude!
10371,Leonard,Um…
10372,Raj,Sorry it’s not part of my heartwarming and personal narrative in which a humble boy from New Delhi overcame poverty and prejudice and journeyed to America to reach for the stars.
10373,Penny,You don’t know?
10374,Penny,Uh-huh.
10375,Sheldon,I have an eidetic memory. I don’t know what his problem is.
10376,Penny,Obviously I care about Leonard. I’m gonna spend the rest of my life with him.
10377,Penny,Get out.
10378,Penny,Thank you for wearing your heels.
10379,Leonard,I don’t know you pretty much covered it.
10380,Leonard,What? I don’t want to do that.
10381,Raj,What do I have to be happy about? My life’s a wreck.
10382,Sheldon,I know. Do you think I should start watching The Flash TV show?
10383,Sheldon,Yeah well he does know his stuff.
10384,Leonard,Not yet.
10385,Howard,Why yes I love to party. Party is my middle name. Or it would be if it weren’t Ramayan.
10386,Penny,We’re gonna have sex.
10387,Leonard,No of course not. I just feel bad.
10388,Howard,Of course you do. Who could forget being that fat?
10389,Leonard,All right you two don’t start. Penny and I are throwing this second wedding for your benefit. Can you please not ruin it?
10390,Leonard,Okay let’s focus. The girls are gone we have 48 hours. There are no distractions. Let’s change the world.
10391,Leonard,He does. And in the kitchen. And in the car. And in his pocket.
10392,Sheldon,No of course not. They thrive on our suffering.
10393,Howard,I have come to an important decision. I will not be accepting your money any more. I’m a man and I can take care of myself.
10394,Sheldon,Are you sure. There are a lot of advantages to buying in bulk. For example I noticed that you purchase your tampons one month’s supply at a time.
10396,Howard,I should’ve peed before we left.
10397,Sheldon,That’s even worse. Using the sweet candy of science to trick children into loving him. Pervert.
10398,Leonard,Unbelievable. 
10399,Sheldon,I caused that fight I feel terrible. Wait I can do that better. I caused that fight. I feel terrible. Yeah wow I don’t know which one I like more.
10400,Penny,It’s like if you’re dating someone you’re not that into and then they break up with you and then you want them more than ever.
10401,Penny,Oh no no. This isn’t a date no. Right?
10402,Sheldon,Leonard you are my friend. And friends support their friends apparently. So I am withdrawing my objection to your desire to have a relationship with Leslie.
10403,Penny,Okay fine whatever um you guys this is my friend Eric.
10404,Leonard,Hey hey what the hell?
10405,Leonard,Your ex-boyfriend?
10406,Penny,Hey Ames.
10407,Penny,Alright come on come on.
10408,Penny,Yeah ’cause you sound really funny.
10409,Penny,Mmm.
10410,Sheldon,Irrelevant. The disruption in your relationship is making my life intolerable.
10411,Sheldon,Huh.
10412,Sheldon,I suppose I could see myself in a scientific boy band. Of course I’d be the dreamy one and the smart one.
10413,Penny,You’re extorting a date out of me?
10414,Raj,Don’t know why he’s so grumpy. I got mistaken for that guy in Life of Pi once and I’m still floating.
10415,Leonard,What happened to all your glow-in-the-dark-emergency-exit stuff you had painted on the floor?
10416,Penny,Oh yeah tonight’s not great for me.
10417,Sheldon,Initiating rotation sequence. Don’t look at me initiate. What does red and yellow mean?
10418,Penny,Wow so how long will you be gone?
10419,Sheldon,Bert I insist that you join us.
10420,Sheldon,Well we could if it were true. But as you live in the same building you see each other all the time. The variable which has changed is the coitus.
10421,Sheldon,Keen observation goodbye.
10422,Penny,Yeah.
10423,Sheldon,Everything is stupid and I want to go home.
10424,Sheldon,It’s hot chocolate with a stick of butter.
10425,Sheldon,Your head goes on the other end.
10426,Sheldon,That’s a good idea. I guess everyone’s having them now.
10427,Penny,Sheldon where are you going? Aren’t you going to clean this up?
10428,Howard,Hey Sheldon you busy?
10429,Sheldon,Excuse me the whole tenure system is ridiculous. A guaranteed job for life only encourages the faculty to become complacent. If we really want science to advance people should have chips implanted in their skulls that explode when they say something stupid.
10430,Raj,Oh of course.
10431,Leonard,You know a lot of scientists believe that making contact with other life-forms would probably not end well for us.
10432,Howard,Okay well that’s a problem.
10433,Howard,Emily you know almost everybody here.
10434,Raj,Where did he pop the question? What did you say?
10435,Howard,No. But it’s a stupid test.
10436,Sheldon,Anything to drink?
10437,Leonard,Nope. Uh uh I might not know what I meant but I know that I didn’t mean that. Not this guy. Oh no way.
10438,Leonard,No I’ll watch the end of the game. Besides there’s only three minutes left.
10439,Howard,Oh oh don’t get me wrong nothing happened with me and Howard. There was about 200 pounds of Sailor Moon between us.
10440,Howard,So does enjoying a meal at a well-lit restaurant but here we are.
10441,Sheldon,Is it me or are you purposely changing the subject?
10442,Raj,You can’t wear the hands on the date.
10443,Sheldon,Romantic love as the basis for marriage has only existed since the nineteenth century. Up until then arranged marriages were the norm and it served society quite well.
10444,Sheldon,Who’s he?
10445,Sheldon,Harsh terms. But all right I’ll just substitute intercourse.
10446,Sheldon,Um… Well… You are black right?
10447,Leonard,That someone was Sheldon and the day was yesterday. Hey look at this. Dear Roger to be opened upon your first great discovery. Love Mom. Wow look at the date. He saved this fifty years and never got to open it.
10448,Sheldon,Well if you were referring to her illness your question should have been what ails her?
10449,Leonard,You’re welcome to try but the other day it took you 15 minutes to get into a FedEx box. 
10451,Penny,Because this company needs you.
10452,Leonard,We don’t know his mother never had him tested.
10453,Howard,It’s nice to think that you grew up in this room and now your daughter’s going to as well.
10454,Raj,What are you waiting for? Kill Wil Wheaton! From hell’s heart stab at him!
10455,Howard,Sheldon if this is too much we can stop.
10456,Raj,As a matter of fact I did. I’ve spent so many years living in fear saying no to new experiences but from now on I’m gonna say yes yes to love yes to adventure yes to life. Whatever it may be the answer’s going to be yes.
10457,Raj,Okay so we know that previous attempts to send a message into space like the Golden Record on Voyager were heavily criticized.
10458,Raj,Look at that. You’ve known you’re gonna be a father for less than a day and you’re already stepping up.
10459,Leonard,Eventually I guess. Although I am kind of curious how long she thinks she can keep hiding my stuff without me knowing.
10460,Penny,Well I don’t want to hurt my dad. You know he always wanted to dance with his daughter at her wedding.
10461,Howard,Dude I’m so sorry.
10462,Raj,I can’t tell you that. But perhaps the killer dropped a fun and imaginative clue somewhere in the apartment.
10463,Raj,Whoa I’m calling my dad okay? He’s got experience dealing with pregnant ladies because he’s an OBGYN. And experience with crazy ladies because of my mom.
10464,Penny,Why do you need all this stuff?
10465,Sheldon,No!
10466,Leonard,Sheldon’s Kryptonite.
10467,Penny,Yes we win again.
10468,Penny,Why are you making this so difficult?
10469,Penny,It’s okay Leonard 
10470,Sheldon,Wait. Excuse me. You forgot my barbecue bacon cheeseburger barbecue sauce bacon and cheese on the side.
10471,Leonard,Have fun.
10472,Leonard,After you wrap the body in reflective tape the ends get Teflon tape so we can get a tight seal.
10473,Leonard,It wasn’t my fault. I had never seen my brother’s project. And my mother could’ve told me before instead of at the ceremony in front of everyone.
10474,Leonard,Now that Howard’s getting married maybe he’ll inflate one of his old girlfriends for you.
10475,Penny,We were; it’s just it’s not fair okay? They’re bad people. It’s not supposed to end happy for them it’s supposed to end happy for me.
10476,Leonard,If Penny didn’t know that Lesley had already turned me down then that would unambiguously mean that she Penny thought that I should her Lesley out indicating that she Penny had no interest in me asking her Penny out. But because she did know that I had asked Lesley out and that she Lesley had turned me down then she Penny could be offering consolation. That’s too bad you would have made a cute couple. But while thinking good Leonard remains available.
10477,Raj,Oh beefaroni. I think I’ll miss you most of all.
10478,Sheldon,Wo de ming zi shi Sheldon. 
10479,Raj,Ooh big talk from a man who was once treed by a chicken.
10480,Sheldon,This insistence on hand-holding is preposterous.
10481,Raj,You know this reminds me of high school.
10482,Sheldon,Fine what do you want me to do?
10483,Sheldon,If you have time to lean you have time to clean.
10484,Howard,Oh why can’t I stay mad at you?
10485,Sheldon,Oh looking through my textbooks for a new field of inquiry. Why do we have a geology book? Leonard did you throw a children’s party while I was in Texas?
10486,Penny,Basketball Pope.
10487,Penny,People.
10488,Leonard,I just keep thinking about how cool it would be if I called my mom and told her that I got tenure at Caltech.
10489,Sheldon,I know.
10490,Sheldon,Oh simple the ‘arrah ‘arrah in the riddle mean Jan Arrah a member of the Legion of Superheroes known as Element Lad. And then the word He it wasn’t the masculine pronoun but rather H e the abbreviation for helium. See where I’m going with this?
10491,Leonard,I told you. That was a different guy.
10492,Sheldon,Well get ready to stroll down memory lane. Penny your check engine…
10493,Raj,I wonder if this is what it feels like to be Bernadette’s baby.
10494,Sheldon,Oh another market to expand into balding gay men.
10495,Penny,There you go.
10496,Leonard,What are you talking about?
10497,Raj,Zack this is my friend Claire.
10498,Raj,Huh. Okay. As long as it doesn’t end with us having coitus with him I’m in.
10499,Sheldon,Excuse me? Isn’t this the point where the world-weary barkeep absentmindedly wipes down the bar and coaxes the woes out of the troubled patron?
10500,Sheldon,Uh I’m going to draw you a soothing bath. Where’s your bath thermometer?
10501,Penny,All of them.
10502,Leonard,So you guys were testing us both? What is the matter with you?
10503,Sheldon,Very well a quick opening statement. Like a milking stool my case rests on three legs. I will demonstrate that I was improperly instructed in driving by a woman whose lack of respect for society borders on the sociopathic. I will argue that the emergency met the legal doctrine of quod est necessarium est licitum that which is necessary is legal. But first I will raise a Sixth Amendment issue. I’m unable to confront my accuser a non-human entity to wit a camera. So to sum up improper instruction quod est necessarium est licitum Sixth Amendment. My milk stool is complete.
10504,Sheldon,Run down the pros and cons of each for me.
10505,Leonard,That’s great but I….
10506,Sheldon,So tell me about your scalar dark energy experiment.
10507,Leonard,Of course not.
10508,Sheldon,Do you realize what this means? All I need is a healthy ovum and I can grow my own Leonard Nimoy!
10509,Raj,Are you sure? That doesn’t sound right.
10510,Sheldon,This should be fairly easy to deduce. He’s holding the phone to his left ear. Ears do not cross hemispheres so he’s using the analytical rather than the emotional side of the brain suggesting that he has no personal relationship with the caller.
10511,Penny,Oh what did those rascals do now?
10513,Leonard,Yeah. It must be nice to have someone do something so romantic.
10514,Penny,Yeah. And there’s your money back and now we’re even. How great is that?
10515,Sheldon,So you’re saying that friendship contains within it an inherent obligation to maintain confidences?
10516,Raj,Uh would you like to come in?
10517,Leonard,And I support you.
10518,Raj,So she’s gonna be laid up for at least six weeks.
10519,Leonard,Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.  Okay.
10520,Leonard,More.
10521,Leonard,I can’t believe you kept this.
10522,Leonard,Damn I need my inhaler.
10523,Sheldon,Not at all. Frequent coitus dramatically increases the odds of fertiliziation.
10524,Leonard,I’ve gotten a lot more street since we broke up.
10525,Penny,Ooh I have an idea. Since it’s not happening any time soon why don’t your character and your character do it in the game?
10526,Sheldon,Oh no it’s all right. I think of my time with Amy as a stick of Fruit Stripe gum. Sweet and enjoyable at first but ultimately a flavourless lump of sadness.
10527,Sheldon,No I do. Eventually you’ll want more space and you’ll move into a house and then instead of dinner a couple of times a week it’ll only be a couple of times a month and then it’ll only be on special occasions like when Bernadette divorces Wolowitz. Or or or like when Koothrappali’s weird girlfriend admits where she buried his body. Or Amy’s wedding where she’s marrying someone better than me.
10529,Leonard,Marry you?
10530,Sheldon,Yes. You’re my ride.
10531,Leonard,Yes okay but I’m gonna be gone for three months. What if she doesn’t miss me that long and she meets someone else?
10532,Howard,Yeah yeah yeah very perky.
10533,Penny,Oh! Bernadette you look beautiful!
10534,Sheldon,I’ll eat later. Right now I’m suckling at the informative bosom of mother physics.
10535,Leonard,Really?
10536,Sheldon,Yeah I have a lactose intolerant roommate with a taste for ice cream. Next.
10537,Raj,Sorry. You’re right. I’m so stressed. But you know what whenever I walk into that temple I realize that whatever happens it’s okay. We’re all part of an immense pattern and though we can’t understand it we can be happy to know that it’s it’s working its will through us.
10538,Penny,Okay well they sure as hell don’t say that.
10539,Howard,Now take a sip swirl it around your mouth and try to notice the flavours the tannins the textures. Well?
10540,Sheldon,Draft. You see people hear the word year and they think duration. Foot pound has the same problem that’s a unit of work not of weight.
10541,Penny,Yeah today Amy and I are deciding what we’re all gonna do.
10542,Raj,What did I do?
10543,Leonard,Yeah sure. He really worked with the Drug Enforcement Agency?
10544,Raj,Yeah?
10545,Sheldon,Sadly Penny this evening I am the Dark Knight roaming these mean streets alone. A windbreaker for my cape and a stern expression for my cowl.
10546,Raj,Come on Sheldon say something.
10547,Howard,What?
10548,Penny,Okay. Have fun.
10549,Leonard,Oh. Yeah okay.
10550,Raj,Dude she said she wants to slow things down.
10551,Howard,Well seeing as its purpose was to piss you off I’d say it’s spot-on.
10552,Sheldon,No it hurt…  Great Caesar’s Ghost look at this place?
10553,Raj,You’re welcome.
10554,Sheldon,Fine. 
10555,Leonard,I’m about to lose control and I think I like it.
10556,Leonard,No.
10557,Leonard,I’m sorry.
10558,Sheldon,You’re so close.
10559,Leonard,Mm just down there.
10560,Sheldon,You’re right. If someone wants to get at Missy’s fallopian tubes they’ll have to go through me.
10561,Raj,Why? So you can make jokes about cutting open my brain?
10562,Leonard,Hey. What’re you working on?
10563,Sheldon,Excuse me in what universe are Slurpies Icees?
10564,Howard,I’ll tell you one thing. If I get rich enough that’s the kind of girl I want to take on a submarine ride. And yes that time I meant it to be dirty.
10565,Penny,No it’s not.
10566,Penny,Uh not that I know of. Hey while we’re on the subject why did you guys break up anyway?
10567,Sheldon,Well I suppose turnabout is fair play.
10568,Penny,That makes even less sense I mean…
10569,Leonard,Yeah we’ll pick a date when we pick a date.
10570,Sheldon,Shotgun.
10571,Penny,How many times do I have to say I’m sorry?
10572,Penny,Yeah sure I guess.
10573,Penny,Yeah.
10574,Leonard,Honestly we’ve been operating under the assumption that he has no deal.
10575,Penny,All right. Thank you. I’m sorry too.
10576,Howard,Oh uh let me try. Uh channelis changeroni. This might be my second favorite brown magic wand.
10577,Raj,Hey guys guess who I found at LAX. My baby sister Priya.
10578,Leonard,Where are we going?
10579,Raj,What’s the matter.
10580,Leonard,What?
10581,Raj,Oh is Cinnamon gonna be okay?
10582,Sheldon,Subtlety isn’t her strong suit is it?
10584,Sheldon,Oh dear lord Penny’s pregnant too?
10585,Howard,Penny how’s it going over there?
10586,Penny,All right Sheldon this craziness has gone on long enough. Please come home so I can cut your hair.
10587,Leonard,Sure. What’s up?
10588,Sheldon,Why would I change?
10589,Leonard,It’s not that bad.
10590,Raj,But Sheldon we don’t have a chance. The only improvement you were able to make on the robot was to put fresh batteries in the remote.
10591,Leonard,I got it I got it. Listen um I think there’s been a misunderstanding. See Penny is my fiancée.
10592,Leonard,I’ll be damned.
10593,Howard,Ah no problem. It wouldn’t be Thanksgiving without an Indian providing the food. Uh now where does your mom keep the Crisco?
10594,Sheldon,Although Amy and I did just move in together and a plant is a lovely housewarming gift.
10595,Leonard,Yeah it turns out someone added simulated signals to the data files. They faked the results.
10596,Raj,Then again he did think you were my husband.
10597,Sheldon,Simple extrapolation. In the three years that I’ve known you you were single for two. During that time I saw 17 different suitors. If we work backwards correcting for observation bias and postulate an initial dating age of 15…
10598,Sheldon,No no wait hold on.
10599,Raj,No I won’t.
10600,Leonard,What? Oh okay uh okay yeah no problem just come up here and help me pull and turn.
10601,Leonard,Everybody?
10602,Leonard,You’re kidding. Did you Heimlich him?
10603,Leonard,Can we please stop saying coitus?
10604,Leonard,Excuse me that’s Priya.
10605,Raj,Like J-Lo’s hair.
10606,Sheldon,Thank you.
10607,Sheldon,Hush hush hush hush hush virtually non-existent. I’m thinking that we set her up with a hosted turnkey e-commerce system to start.
10608,Sheldon,So we have to go back.
10609,Penny,Yeah that’s when I buy shoes. Now let’s see what we’ve got. Ooh! This is nice.
10610,Leonard,It’s only for five weeks.
10611,Leonard,It’s totally different. Bert’s money might run out but I can beg until the end of time.
10612,Raj,Yeah you’re right that’s too personal. We hardly know each other. How about a cup of coffee?
10613,Penny,Yeah I guess you’re right.
10614,Penny,You couldn’t give us just one weekend?
10615,Leonard,And you were worried about the romance. 000318914
10616,Sheldon,I love you too.
10617,Leonard,Wait so we just go over there?
10618,Raj,That’s Professor Wilkinson’s wife she’s like 80 years old.
10619,Sheldon,That’s outrageous. This is our idea based on our research. How can you possibly justify owning a majority share?
10620,Howard,What’s the matter?
10621,Leonard,Okay good ’cause I wasn’t really gonna go.
10622,Sheldon,Really? Did they find evidence to support extra dimensions or supersymmetry?
10623,Howard,Hey dude you’re killing me with Claire.
10624,Leonard,No I didn’t just move in. First we had to iron out a few details. 
10625,Raj,Two words 3-D printer. Wait maybe it’s three words. No hang on. Okay one word a letter and a number and maybe a hyphen. 3-D printer.
10626,Penny,Wow. You know the last time I saw my grandma the most exciting thing was watching the ash of her cigarette get longer and wondering if it was gonna fall in her pudding.
10627,Raj,I’m taking you home.
10628,Raj,And we’ve built it up in our heads so much.
10629,Penny,Leonard?
10630,Leonard,No.
10631,Howard,It’s nice of you to let him keep staying at your mom’s house.
10632,Penny,I didn’t break it. I I guess Stuart sold it to me like this.
10633,Howard,Good black is more slimming. Oh that’s her. I got to go be butch. Toodles. Hey.
10634,Leonard,Look even when Penny and I started living together there was a learning curve. But I promise you it does get easier.
10635,Leonard,What’s up?
10636,Penny,Not a lot. Just that we always have the option of going back to being friends.
10637,Leonard,Hey you coming to lunch?
10638,Penny,Hey. Amy’s downstairs.
10639,Leonard,Don’t worry about it. It’s my treat.
10640,Sheldon,What time did you tell Amy to be here?
10641,Penny,Oh grow up.
10642,Sheldon,He’s upstairs at Alicia’s.
10643,Sheldon,Or maybe I’m part of a new species that lives for hundreds of years which means I’m still basically a toddler.
10644,Leonard,What’s he doing here?
10645,Sheldon,No she chose to have a home birth because she wants to live in the Stone Age and a cave wasn’t available.
10646,Sheldon,Yes. Why does that seem to flabbergast everybody?
10648,Leonard,I am. Are you interested in physics?
10649,Howard,That is one tough birdie.
10650,Sheldon,Good choice. Critical hit. Your sword goes through its eye into its tiny brain. With its final dying gasp it says you have reduced me to a pile of sushi. Enjoy me with this packet of soy sauce. It’s low sodium. Aaaah.
10651,Sheldon,I apologize that it’s so warm in here.
10652,Howard,I wonder what the non-pathetic people are doing tonight.
10653,Leonard,There’s a reciprocity clause. You get to pull the plug on him too.
10654,Leonard,No. What happened?
10655,Sheldon,Hey look now maybe you have democracy now in your beloved Russia but on this physics bowl team I rule with an iron fist. . Ow!
10656,Leonard,What do you mean?
10657,Sheldon,I don’t think you’re taking this seriously.
10658,Penny,Hey what’s going on with you?
10659,Howard,I don’t know about you but I feel empowered.
10660,Sheldon,You think you don’t care?
10661,Howard,Oh yeah?
10662,Howard,Well they’re looking to include a message from Earth in case one of them is encountered by alien life.
10663,Sheldon,It’s just a heart-shaped locket with a picture of Leonard’s face in it. He got it at the mall on clearance. Now move move move.
10664,Sheldon,This is an interesting way to stay out of it.
10665,Howard,Well I’ve always had this fantasy that involves dancing. The sexual chemistry between my partner and me is electric. But boy oh boy does my father not approve until he sees us in the big dance competition.
10666,Raj,Hey look there’s Rothman’s empty office. Sad.
10667,Sheldon,Hello.
10668,Sheldon,Dr. Koothrappali would you care to join the conversation?
10670,Raj,Hey everybody! The bachelor boy has arrived! For he’s a jolly good fellow…
10671,Penny,All right. So what’s new in your life?
10672,Sheldon,Tell me the truth.
10673,Howard,She’s so considerate.
10674,Sheldon,I’m going the other way. Bye.
10675,Sheldon,Way ahead of you. I was thinking of moving Big Boy to Thursdays and just dropping Soup Plantation.
10676,Leonard,I highly doubt that. Go away. . Are you still out there?
10677,Sheldon,This is ridiculous. I’m a grown man from Texas. This isn’t a terrifying bird like a swan or a goose. It’s just a blue jay.  No!
10678,Raj,Sure. We’ve both been in his shoes. We’ll let him down with compassion and respect.
10679,Raj,It’s bigger than the house my grandfather grew up in.
10680,Penny,Yeah maybe.
10681,Leonard,No. Steve Patterson told me.
10682,Sheldon,It’s magnificent. This is going to be the best Valentine’s Day ever.
10683,Sheldon,Must you?
10684,Leonard,Penny proposed and I didn’t say yes.
10685,Penny,So tenured means a job for life?
10687,Raj,Not that I can think of.
10688,Penny,No you’ve got a Reebok with a gunshot wound and an ouchie on your pinkie toe.
10689,Leonard,When you live with someone there’s gonna be conflict. You just have to keep communicating.
10690,Howard,Uh pull over.
10692,Leonard,Sheldon he’s just gonna do a few magic tricks for some kids. I really don’t think they’re gonna end up liking the Green Lantern movie.
10693,Leonard,Well DTS has more low end so… okay.
10695,Leonard,You know you never told me what happened between you and Bernadette.
10696,Howard,When I’m feeling low I have sex with a girl. But that’s just me.
10697,Penny,Forget it Leonard. It’s over.
10698,Penny,Sorry.
10699,Leonard,Ooh! Sorry I thought you were gonna do that.
10700,Raj,And and the worst part is that they kicked me out and let Stuart stay.
10701,Sheldon,Yes. This is Enrico Fermi Richard Feynman Edward Teller Otto Frisch and Zazzles.
10702,Penny,Oh that’s sad.
10703,Penny,Why did you get bongos?
10704,Leonard,Really? What happened?
10705,Howard,Sheldon get over here and help.
10706,Penny,Okay I know you don’t want to talk about it but can I just ask you one question about your mom’s book?
10707,Howard,Of course. I know what it’s like having to go through a loved one’s possessions. My uncle was a worshipper of Krishna. But after he died you know what we found? A statue of Shiva. It may not be Crips and Bloods okay? But in India it’s a thing.
10708,Sheldon,Aw. Embarrassed you?
10709,Sheldon,Hide me.
10710,Leonard,Oh that is not true.
10711,Raj,I think it’s lovely you call your mommy and let her know you’re going to be late for dinner. From what I know about these things if a woman doesn’t breast-feed on time it’s very uncomfortable for her boobies.
10712,Penny,Okay just hang on.
10713,Raj,Oh come on. I don’t want to sit by myself.
10714,Penny,And that’s how a girl makes a scene. I’m sorry sweetie. You’re right. You deserve your weekend. Come on Amy let’s go.
10715,Leonard,I don’t know maybe that you’d be a little upset and then you’d realize that I’m a stallion that has to run free. And that would turn you on a little.
10716,Sheldon,No it’s not the… Never mind.
10717,Howard,Well you were always so nice to me I thought maybe you liked me.
10718,Sheldon,So she’s deceiving me in order to spend more time with me?
10719,Penny,No. No I want to. Look we’ve put this off long enough. Let’s do it.
10720,Leonard,And it helps to have small delicate fingers. So don’t be discouraged if you can’t do it as fast as me and Howard.
10721,Penny,I’m cute. I get by.
10722,Sheldon,Why aren’t you talking to me?
10723,Raj,You own the damn thing. Just take a freaking sweater!
10724,Leonard,Hmm?
10725,Raj,Almost. Oh what did you put as the one-word description of yourself?
10726,Sheldon,Are you sure? With your Italian pizza and my Chinese noodles we could play Marco Polo. I mean of course a re-enactment of a meal in the life of Marco Polo the Venetian explorer not Marco Polo the terrifying water sport.
10727,Penny,Do you know how much gas is?
10728,Leonard,Four thousand dollars worth every penny.
10729,Penny,Yeah?
10730,Leonard,Fine. You leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen. There are carrots and lumps of coal in the water.
10731,Raj,You’re wasting your time. Just please leave me alone.
10732,Howard,Come on Leonard dinner.
10733,Howard,Yeah maybe we’ll get lucky with some sexy cowgirls.
10734,Raj,I will slowly seduce her until she falls helpless into my bed hungry for the pleasure only I can give her.
10735,Penny,No we’re gonna stop at Target on the way.
10736,Penny,You know since I moved last year not all my mail has been forwarded.
10737,Sheldon,Fascinating.
10738,Leonard,I know what you’re doing.
10739,Sheldon,You’re gonna enjoy this. I designed it especially for you.
10740,Sheldon,Oh now you’re just making stuff up.
10741,Sheldon,That’s not true. Koothrapali and Wolowitz come over all the time.
10742,Sheldon,Who would ask me?
10743,Leonard,Yeah.
10744,Sheldon,Okay. Well shall we check each other for ticks?
10745,Howard,Mm. Hello Daddy. What’s up?
10746,Leonard,You guys have fun.
10747,Leonard,Good. Then before we reintroduce them we’ll give him one of her sweaters so he can get used to her scent again.
10748,Sheldon,Break it off shake hands walk away.
10749,Sheldon,I see. Apparently my earlier inquiry regarding you and Leonard crossed some sort of line. I apologize.
10750,Sheldon,808.
10751,Penny,Leonard.
10752,Sheldon,Now I notice you’re using titanium did you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes they’re lighter cheaper and half twice the tensile strength.
10753,Penny,What can we do that’s free?
10754,Raj,Now that everything’s out on the table you you think you two will keep living together?
10755,Penny,Oh look at you you bad boy. Did you tell her about Priya?
10756,Howard,I’m not sure. Um wait. Jump up and down let’s see if they jiggle. Uh no I I still can’t tell uh oh you know what? Okay uh give me some of this.
10757,Leonard,I’m helping.
10759,Sheldon,How else are they going to learn? Look question 2 when are roadways most slippery? Now okay there are three answers none of which are correct. The correct answer is when covered by a film of liquid sufficient to reduce the coefficient of static friction between the tire and the road to essentially zero but not so deep as to introduce a new source of friction.
10760,Leonard,It was a late-night vote. We were all exhausted and he was threatening to filibuster. It’s not technically Road Trip God it’s Travel Supervisor.
10761,Sheldon,You have so few good ideas Leonard. And you’re just going to spill the beans in front of an outsider?
10762,Penny,Well what do you mean why? Look I make more sales if these doctors think I’m single. I did the same kind of thing as a waitress. The real question is what is he doing in your apartment?
10763,Sheldon,It’s a billion dollar idea. Shhhhh!
10764,Raj,What the hell is that?
10765,Leonard,Oh no no you have it wrong. No. I I was going to be a jackass but I stopped myself. I stayed a good guy so I’m gonna pass on the sex. But you should know that’s not a comment on your hotness but on my goodness. That’s kind of my superpower. I’m like Captain Good Guy.
10766,Penny,Oh my God would you stop bringing it up?
10767,Leonard,Well…
10768,Leonard,I don’t want to fly kites Sheldon. We’re watching football here.
10769,Raj,Welcome to another classic Koothrappali murder mystery dinner.
10770,Sheldon,May I point out in a parallel universe your friends are saying Maggie McGeary she sounds lovely.
10771,Raj,I’m so not talking to you. I’m talking to him.
10772,Howard,No seriously. It’s about being present in the moment focusing on the feeling of the warm water the smell of the detergent the sound of the dishes squeaking and following your own breath. It’s about it’s about simply being.
10773,Penny,Uh-huh.
10774,Sheldon,Very well done.
10775,Penny,No.
10776,Raj,Hey.
10777,Leonard,Five movies two hours apiece. It’s a start.
10778,Sheldon,As I have explained repeatedly unlike you I don’t need validation from lesser minds. No offence.
10779,Sheldon,Or a mutant army. It depends on how my Kickstarter goes.
10780,Sheldon,She’d see right through that. We go to the zoo all the time. She knows my koala face. And for future reference it’s this.
10781,Leonard,What was that?
10782,Leonard,Not if I want to be doing this later.
10783,Sheldon,The dice giveth and the dice taketh away.
10784,Sheldon,Amy’s sick.
10785,Howard,Stuart and I are putting dating profiles online and it’s one of the questions. And thank you I’d kill for that woman’s bone structure.
10786,Raj,Is that true?
10787,Howard,Certainly. I’d like to raise two points. Number one I think they are talking about penises. And number two these mimosas are kicking my little brown ass.
10788,Howard,Well somebody else knows because they saw it in the folder.
10789,Penny,Do you want some.
10790,Raj,Maybe maybe.
10791,Howard,Okay an eight is acceptable if she’s willing to bring another eight to the hot tub.
10792,Leonard,Hey Alex let me ask you something. My girlfriend knows this guy at school. He’s got an English accent.
10793,Sheldon,Shut it. Offices are assigned by seniority. I arrived at the university first.
10794,Penny,Yeah it’s fun isn’t it?
10795,Howard,Oh another two hours to go. The wait is killing me.
10796,Penny,I don’t know.
10797,Howard,Right okay. What are you doing tomorrow preevning?
10798,Sheldon,No no wait no hang on look at this next question.
10799,Leonard,No it’s always him.
10800,Penny,Okay. Then I’ll return the favour and I won’t tell…
10801,Leonard,Okay Sheldon what do you want me to do hide the information? If I don’t publish it it’s just a matter of time before someone else does.
10803,Raj,Oh uh Howard was an astronaut. Maybe that’s where you saw him.
10804,Leonard,Yeah.
10805,Howard,Did that do anything?
10806,Raj,Forget the Jet Skis? That was our line in the sand! What happened to “tear them a new one?”
10807,Leonard,That’s it. It’s Sheldon’s bedtime he is in for the night.
10808,Sheldon,You say it’s itchy and uncomfortable. I say situations like this make me feel the same way.
10809,Sheldon,It’s not hard. It’s simple. You can either sit with me your friend colleague and roommate or you can sit with an overrated scientist you might have sex with.
10810,Sheldon,A magic show is an inherently deceitful proposition. This is an ordinary top hat. You’ve chosen that card freely. I do not have a set of lock picks lodged in my keister.
10811,Sheldon,Oh and speaking of Valentine’s Day I haven’t forgotten about you tonight.
10812,Raj,Is something going on with him and Bernadette?
10814,Leonard,Okay one sec.
10815,Raj,Oh fun. Let me see. Uh no no uh definitely not.
10816,Sheldon,Oh good. I’m not keeping you from anything. Your check engine light is on.
10817,Raj,Yes Rajesh Koothrappali. Look uh I just I wanted to say I’m sorry. Okay? You were like the coolest person I ever found online and I got really nervous and I I just blew it.
10818,Raj,Oh well I’m sure they wouldn’t have tasted nearly as good if I hadn’t tried your food first.
10819,Leonard,Mm Penny’s gonna call her dad and tell him it’s not a good time for Randall to visit.
10820,Raj,What?
10821,Howard,What?
10822,Sheldon,No.
10823,Sheldon,Bert Rebecca. I’d like to apologize for my insensitive comment earlier.
10824,Sheldon,Yes.
10825,Leonard,I’m sorry Sheldon. I should’ve told you I was back. I just wanted to have a couple days alone with Penny.
10826,Penny,Uh no they usually don’t have to go out and get more wax.
10827,Leonard,Again I’m sorry. You know with Howard and Bernadette getting married I got caught up in a little wedding fever. I take it back.
10828,Howard,Dude that movie’s an imperialist fantasy that makes the followers of a beautiful and peaceful religion look like a bunch of bloodthirsty barbarians.
10829,Leonard,Feel like driving to Arizona with me?
10830,Leonard,Boy I’m kind of tuckered out. How are you feeling Elizabeth?
10831,Sheldon,No the guy in charge is in ch… why is everyone so bad at these?
10832,Penny,Gah I’m not perfect.
10833,Sheldon,It might be easier to show you.
10834,Penny,Yeah I’m just making a mess.
10835,Sheldon,I hadn’t thought of that. I guess we’re done here.
10836,Leonard,Yeah but it’s not pathetic that’s where I draw the line. Come on we’ll have fun.
10837,Sheldon,Perhaps he’s at a sensitive point in his monthly cycle.
10838,Penny,Oh hang on Sheldon getting another call.
10839,Leonard,What’s this do spin?
10840,Penny,What idea?
10841,Raj,Hey do you think the elastic woman in The Incredibles needs to use birth control or can she just be a diaphragm?
10842,Howard,Hello.
10843,Sheldon,Hi Leonard. Hello Raj.
10844,Leonard,Well if it makes you feel any better I screwed things up pretty good with Penny.
10845,Sheldon,Let’s see what I’ll be washing that succotash down with. A pitcher of margaritas.
10846,Raj,Hold on. Sheldon is there ketchup on that table?
10847,Raj,It is.
10848,Raj,Oh why does he need a ladder?
10849,Raj,Sure. I love animated movies.
10850,Sheldon,Alright. But I’m watching you.
10851,Sheldon,What why did you get a party sub?
10852,Leonard,Because it’s orange and you think it makes you look like a slutty carrot.
10853,Howard,Train day?
10854,Penny,We had one of those silly fake weddings.
10855,Sheldon,My catapult flings my bishop to Howard’s Queen’s Gorilla two.
10856,Leonard,Oh God.
10857,Penny,I got you a little something to cheer you up.
10858,Leonard,Sheldon buddy I just don’t think this is going to come together for you.
10859,Raj,Wait wait. I I found your blog here you wrote about me.
10860,Penny,God!
10861,Penny,Look it’s fine. We’re not getting married okay? We’re keeping things you know homeostasis.
10862,Sheldon,Oh yes you’re the dermatologist. I went for a walk yesterday without sunscreen. Do you see anything on my forehead that I should be concerned about?
10863,Sheldon,Amy Farrah Fowler that’s the most pragmatic thing anyone has ever said to me.
10864,Sheldon,Sometimes he gets cranky but you can trust him with your life. And he does more things for you than I can even begin to list.
10865,Leonard,I kind of have other plans tonight.
10866,Howard,You hear that Stuart? I’ve got a dog and a godchild you have nothing.
10867,Leonard,What are you gonna say?
10868,Sheldon,Leonard there’s one more thing. Under Article One Section Three of our Roommate Agreement I’m calling an emergency meeting.
10869,Howard,My god you think that every thought that comes out of your head is pure gold. Well let me tell you something. Some of those thoughts are pure caca.
10870,Penny,Okay. Um how about this? You know how you’re always trying to learn about sarcasm?
10871,Penny,Another? Great.
10873,Penny,There a new girlfriend in there? ‘Cause you might need one.
10874,Penny,No I can’t.
10875,Sheldon,Milk Dud?
10876,Raj,Lack of confidence.
10877,Howard,Nothing I’m fine.
10878,Sheldon,This isn’t breakfast it’s an experiment.
10879,Howard,She built an ice castle made a snow monster and gave herself a complete makeover in one day. You know what I saw you do today? Eat a block of cream cheese straight from the foil and lie about it to your wife.
10880,Sheldon,I’m not upset. I’m just imagining a world without my best friend in it.
10881,Raj,Why did you do that?
10882,Leonard,Uh 12 bucks.
10883,Penny,That’s great. Cheerleading way to man things up.
10885,Sheldon,Well I don’t want to go to a party.
10886,Leonard,Sure.
10887,Sheldon,Oh even I know that’s lame.
10888,Leonard,Uh Penny there’s something I have to tell you.
10889,Leonard,Yeah.
10890,Howard,Oh we should have a plan in case one of us gets lucky.
10891,Leonard,Does that mean you’ve ruled me out as a suspect?
10892,Penny,What are you waiting for?
10893,Raj,But it’s beautiful.
10894,Leonard,Great. Just relax and enjoy. Tonight is all about you.
10895,Penny,Yes.
10896,Sheldon, Amy?
10897,Sheldon,Oh since you put it that way I’d love to go but that sounds even more awful.
10898,Penny,Let me see that. Oh screw it. I can deal with a little self-loathing. Let’s go find me a heinie to bite.
10899,Penny,It’s great to see you too. Come on in.
10900,Sheldon,Yeah exactly. Did you know those techniques were used to actually teach pigeons to play ping-pong?
10901,Leonard,You don’t have to go. You’re welcome to hang with us.
10902,Sheldon,Leonard she might be drunk. All she had was chips.
10903,Leonard,What’s that? Really? Right now?
10904,Howard,Look at this mouthwash lotion body wash shampoo and conditioner together in one tiny bottle. I love Las Vegas.
10905,Penny,No. Bernadette’s working late.
10906,Penny,Okay okay okay okay okay. Let’s let’s let’s just recap our options. All right we’ve got harp thing sheep thing.
10907,Howard,Uh a smile means something different in my country. You know tears of joy smile of sadness. India’s a goofy place.
10908,Howard,Wait what are you doing? I can’t scissors by myself! Howard! Come back!
10909,Raj,Oh but I bought Chinese takeout.
10910,Leonard,Maybe you can.
10911,Penny,Sure.
10912,Sheldon,Penny?
10913,Raj,Ooh this could be something. forty-three is the number of calories in half a cup of fat-free yoghurt.
10914,Howard,We should have asked her to get some Funyuns.
10915,Sheldon,Wheaton!
10916,Sheldon,You’re right I’ll give him a shot.
10917,Leonard,Read it back one more time.
10918,Leonard,Do the shrimpers feature in your story?
10919,Penny,They have other things.
10920,Penny,Oh so nothing. Great. Do they know why the pipe burst?
10921,Sheldon,Oh no! 
10922,Sheldon,Well just keep in mind that should you ever need a slightly apathetic tertiary friend I stand at the ready.
10923,Raj,No you see I’m doing this so I can stop being spoiled and you know grow as a person.
10924,Penny,Oh it’s a snowflake from the North Pole. Leonard gave it to me last year.
10925,Sheldon,Schrodinger’s Cat.
10926,Penny,Are you telling me for the past four months I have been asking you what’s new and you never thought to go with Sheldon has a girlfriend?
10927,Sheldon,I would imagine it is. This is my friend and roommate Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.
10928,Penny,Sheldon come back you’re losing me.
10929,Leonard,You know I think we’re zeroing in on your problem.
10930,Sheldon,But enough about the Czech Republic. Let’s talk about the time Moldova made Romania a birthday cake and Romania said it tasted good even though it didn’t. And yet Romania gets dumped. I’ll pause here while you mull that one over. I know right?
10931,Sheldon,For a noble purpose to spare me the social embarrassment of having a drug-addled first cousin which I’m assuming is embarrassing yes?
10932,Sheldon,I drank alcohol and may have left an unfortunate voice mail for Stephen Hawking.
10933,Penny,You know what? That was almost on topic. I’m gonna say good job Sheldon.
10934,Sheldon,Of course.
10935,Leonard,Everything? Aren’t you worried about your health?
10936,Penny,Well I learned from the best.
10937,Leonard,Star Wars on Blu-ray.
10938,Sheldon,Thank you. Oh and technically it’s apples that turn into were-oranges when the moon is full. Hey this is fun. We should do it sometime when you aren’t all PMS’ing. Bye.
10939,Sheldon,Princeton? A fine institution. The place where Albert Einstein taught. And where Leonard got his PhD so it may have gone downhill.
10940,Sheldon,Very well.
10941,Penny, Sheldon.
10942,Leonard,Hey you got a sec?
10943,Howard,Well he could bring the baby here.
10944,Leonard,No.
10945,Sheldon,I’m glad you decided to reject your animal hindbrain and return to the realm of pure intellect.
10946,Penny,Um sure. What do you what do you got in mind?
10947,Sheldon,Yes probably. But until we know for sure how can I feel better?
10948,Sheldon,Oh I recommend that too. That was a magical experience.
10949,Sheldon,Oh that seems overly harsh. I mean you gave in to a human weakness you didn’t kill a man. You know it’s a tad old-school but my father was not one to spare the rod when my brother would sneak into his truck and drink his driving whiskey.
10950,Raj,Oh.
10951,Leonard,Well I was trying to act like we weren’t seeing each other. That was the plan right?
10952,Raj,Why me?
10953,Howard,I’m spoiled? Your baby has a cape that costs $300.
10954,Leonard,Hey great.
10955,Penny,Are you getting sick?
10956,Penny,Oh we are so taking you dancing.
10957,Sheldon,But I don’t drive and I can’t take the bus.
10958,Howard,It is. But once a year on the seventh day of the seventh month Vega cries so hard that all the magpies in the world fly up and create a bridge with their wings so the two lovers can be together for a single night of passion.
10959,Raj,Sheldon I’ve hidden the dirty sock from the roof somewhere in your apartment. Unless you are willing to come with us to meet this girl it will remain there forever.
10960,Leonard,I hadn’t…
10961,Sheldon,They stole everything Leonard everything.
10962,Howard,Well I I really couldn’t. But uh I’ve had a lovely time eating your brisket and hearing about the things you’ve had removed from your body over the years. Didn’t know you could have a cyst inside another cyst.
10963,Sheldon,Interesting. Sword fighting does hold a certain elegant appeal. And I would imagine it meets many of our personal criteria for a sport.
10964,Howard,These spring rolls are amazing. Good job Bernadette.
10965,Penny,Well then good news. Today’s the day a girl’s finally going to touch you in your little special place.  Now give him his stuff back.
10966,Penny,Why?
10967,Sheldon,Perhaps what Leonard is obliquely referring to is the occurrence of some sort of sexual dysfunction.
10968,Sheldon,And it was Sheldon Cooper who said let’s speed this up. A lot of people want to talk.
10969,Penny,Riddle me this…
10970,Sheldon,Oh. Yay.
10971,Howard,Did you sign this?
10972,Penny,Well that depends.
10973,Leonard,Oh why? Do you not want to go?
10975,Howard,That’s just Amy.
10976,Penny,Don’t take this away from me.
10977,Howard,No. But if you catch anything I know how to steam it in banana leaves.
10978,Leonard,What it is is a cacophonous assault of eucalyptus bayberry cinnamon and vanilla. It’s as if my head were trapped in the pyjamas of a sultan.
10979,Sheldon,She popped by to borrow a cup of mad cow disease.
10980,Raj,We are. We are. Oh no. What a terrible serve. Sorry brother.
10981,Leonard,Whatcha doin’?
10982,Leonard,Penny?
10983,Sheldon,Science it is.
10984,Raj,Don’t be ridiculous. Waiter?
10985,Sheldon,If you’re hoping to get in touch with Bill Nye I can’t help you. I’ve been informed that he’s now Bill Nye the Restraining Order Guy.
10986,Howard,Wow if he cracks that it’s a game changer guys. It’ll completely redefine our understanding of the physical universe.
10987,Penny,No come on it’s going to be fun and you all look great I mean look at you Thor and oh Peter Pan that’s so cute.
10988,Sheldon, Penny.
10989,Raj,Stuart?
10990,Sheldon,Did you enjoy the humorous footnote where I illustrate mirror-symmetry by likening it to the Flash playing tennis with himself?
10991,Penny,Oh and if you lose the game you have to go out with Stuart.
10992,Sheldon,Assuming I can keep up this pace three hours 11 minutes and plus however long it takes to conclude this fairly pointless conversation.
10993,Leonard,I could stack the logs conically to facilitate airflow.
10994,Sheldon,Of course it did. It’s said that Archimedes the ancient Greek mathematician discovered the principle of displacement while taking a bath.
10995,Leonard,Seriously? Gamma rays? Bruce Banner? You didn’t get The Incredible Hulk from that? Never mind just please go talk to him.
10996,Sheldon,Sorry you’re on a need-to-know basis.
10997,Leonard,Uh a BLT where the B stands for beaver? I don’t know.
10998,Leonard,It is actually. In fact I gave it a lot of thought and I decided it was time for us to live together.
10999,Leonard,Sheldon you know I can’t eat butter. I’m lactose intolerant.
11000,Sheldon,But how were our seats?
11001,Sheldon,Is not. Is not is not.
11002,Sheldon,All right let’s start right now. Uh rule number one no using sexuality to get your way.
11003,Raj,Wait hang on. Did you go to a cowboy bar?
11004,Howard,Hey the jaw wants what it wants.
11005,Leonard,Switzerland. And I get to bring a guest!
11006,Sheldon,Are you expecting me to offer an explanation of human behaviour?
11007,Howard,Well that’s what we wanted. This is as hot as the mines will be.
11008,Raj,Paul.
11009,Sheldon,Needy Baby Greedy Baby indeed.
11010,Leonard,Wow Donkey Kong. This this was my game when I was a kid.
11011,Sheldon,Oh Penny I see you’ve ordered pizza. I have Chinese food.
11012,Howard,Ooh what if we got a van and drove around and picked kids up?
11013,Sheldon,Interesting her jaws are clenched no tongue access clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans.
11014,Leonard,I thought you weren’t interested in me.
11015,Leonard,Because this is not Star Trek
11016,Leonard,Why oh no?
11017,Penny,Nope you know what you might as well read it everybody else has go ahead. Oh God I just feel so betrayed and embarrassed. I just want to crawl into a hole and die.
11018,Sheldon,I’m sorry Raj but I have no interest in playing a game in which I find no challenge.
11019,Leonard,No.
11020,Sheldon,I see. And is that why everybody was invited but me?
11021,Sheldon,What an innovative solution. Perhaps I don’t give your MIT education enough credit.
11022,Sheldon,That seems like a reasonable request. Although so did hey Leonard would you mind returning that DVD?
11023,Leonard,Yeah. I wish I’d fought harder for the rest of ’em.
11024,Howard,That’s rough.
11025,Howard,Did he get superpowers?
11026,Penny,Good luck. I threw out all my tall ones when I married Leonard.
11027,Sheldon,You mean the myofascial point?
11028,Leonard,You think it’s time you apologize to her yourself?
11029,Penny,Hey Princeton look at that Team Community College Night School is in the lead.
11030,Penny,This place is really beautiful.
11031,Sheldon,I guess I just need to face it I’m no longer a wunderkind. Now I just wonder what’s for lunch.
11032,Leonard,Oh. Okay.
11033,Penny,So? He loves trains.
11034,Leonard,No good Sheldon doesn’t float.
11035,Howard,But Amy when you and Sheldon split up didn’t you start dating someone right away?
11036,Sheldon,No. This is to train for a three-month expedition to the magnetic North Pole.
11037,Sheldon,Leonard will be here in a moment. He’s looking for a different parking space.
11038,Raj,And the other half licking my face. That’s why I’m brushing her teeth.
11039,Penny,Oh poor baby.
11040,Sheldon,Ours doesn’t need an immune system because it lives in a state-of-the-art German incubator.
11041,Penny,Well it’s no different than when Sheldon used to climb in bed with us during a thunderstorm.
11042,Raj,Yeah of course.
11043,Leonard,Regardless I have a chance at a real relationship with Lesley I’m not going to pass that up for some hypothetical future happiness with a woman who may or may not want me to be happy with a woman who is currently making me happy.
11044,Raj,Oh my God Cinnamon are you okay? I can’t believe you two. You do whatever it takes to save her life. If she needs new organs I’ll buy any dog necessary and scrap them for parts.
11045,Leonard,Well what are you going to do Sheldon give up?
11046,Howard,What the? Are you crazy? You can’t talk about social anxiety to someone who has social anxiety. It makes them socially anxious!
11047,Leonard,Aw.
11048,Raj,Son of a bitch.
11049,Penny,Hit me.
11050,Leonard,That’s Bruce Lee.
11051,Leonard,Read this woman’s tweet.
11052,Raj,No.
11053,Leonard,All right Sheldon to start our quest you need to open this little Christmas gift I got you.
11054,Sheldon,But I don’t want a vacation.
11055,Leonard,I don’t know. When I’m in bed with a girl it’s just it’s my go to response.
11056,Penny,Oh hi.
11057,Sheldon,Smell that? That’s the smell of new comic books. Oh yes!
11058,Leonard,No it’s exactly what you’re saying. I’m the boring thing you’re choosing because I’m good for you.
11059,Sheldon,That’s the wrong box. Put it back.
11060,Leonard,We are next to a Suburu with a Gore/Lieberman bumper sticker.
11061,Sheldon,I didn’t say that.
11062,Leonard,Twelve.
11063,Sheldon,Now Amy already has a real harp. And it can play any song. What are you trying to pull here?
11064,Howard,Yes.
11065,Sheldon,It’s Stephen Hawking.
11066,Penny,Did that sound okay to you? Do not come in here!
11067,Penny,The horror!
11068,Leonard,Maybe your tongue is shrinking.
11069,Raj,That’s not overconfidence that’s observation.
11070,Penny,So were you turned on even a little bit?
11071,Sheldon,Yes?
11072,Howard,And and the worst part is that they kicked me out and let Stuart stay.
11073,Sheldon,I don’t trust banks. I believe that when the robots rise up ATMs will lead the charge.
11074,Raj,Well then why didn’t you say that to her?
11075,Leonard,No no no. It’s not okay.
11076,Howard,I don’t know maybe drive down to Hollywood hit a few hot spots see if I can get lucky.
11077,Penny,So afternoon tea was a bust.
11078,Sheldon,I know. As I’m sure you’re aware…
11079,Raj,Great so I can take them both out with a number-two pencil?
11080,Sheldon,Who else has access to this room?
11081,Sheldon,It says here that up to 80% of new mothers experience baby blues. And that the best thing to do is reassure them that they’re doing a good job. Bernadette you are doing a good job.
11082,Penny,I’ll be back.
11083,Leonard,Yeah.
11085,Leonard,Really?
11086,Penny,You guys need anything else?
11087,Raj,I I hope we didn’t make the puzzles too hard.
11089,Leonard,You really didn’t like our paper?
11090,Leonard,Look if this was 15000 years ago by virtue of his size and strength Kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners.
11091,Leonard,No that was completely called for. We need quiet.
11092,Penny,Ooh Sheldon gonna get some.
11093,Raj,My father pays for it. Do you know how much your rent is?
11094,Howard,What? Why?
11095,Howard,Can we please make a decision not only are there children starving in India there’s an Indian starving right here.
11096,Howard,We still on for tomorrow night?
11097,Penny,Oh oh Stan Lee! Cool!
11098,Howard,We need a social catalyst.
11099,Sheldon,You could have offered me a ride home.
11100,Sheldon,Mrs. Wunch in fourth grade. And my slogan was a line that’s straight is a line that’s great.
11101,Howard,I feel cool. Like Puss in Boots.
11102,Leonard,No.
11103,Raj,This is not a safe place. You can’t share anything here.
11104,Penny,Okay.
11105,Sheldon,All right. Pick a card.
11106,Leonard,A dolphin might.
11107,Sheldon,Bert you’re tying up the line. My apologies to all of you trying to call in with legitimate flag comments.
11108,Penny,Wow. That is amazing.
11109,Penny,Okay well what do you communicate about?
11110,Leonard,Yeah. My record was six.
11111,Howard,Okay well if I move in you can’t use mine. Hold on a second. Hey Howard uh how’s the Wi-Fi in the garage?
11112,Sheldon,This is a disaster. I distinctly ordered the Leonard Nimoy Mr. Spock cardboard standee. Why would I feel safer with Zachary Quinto at the foot of my bed?
11113,Leonard,I don’t want to play a game Sheldon.
11114,Howard,You know checking e-mail updating my facebook status messing up wikipedia entries. Hey did you know Netflix lets you stream movies on your computer now?
11115,Sheldon,Right. Always right.
11116,Leonard,Can’t we make a one-time exception for tonight?
11117,Penny,You don’t have to check with me. Do whatever you want.
11118,Sheldon,I want soup.
11120,Sheldon,Yes he does. He caters to my every whim.
11121,Sheldon,Why don’t we leave that for future generations to decide?
11122,Howard,No.
11123,Sheldon,When last we spoke you said you needed time.
11124,Sheldon,First warning.
11125,Howard,What time do you and Bernadette head out?
11126,Leonard,Are you kidding me?
11127,Leonard,I don’t know. Between you playing chess like Bobby Fischer and Sheldon being okay with you in his spot I’m guessing someone went back in time stepped on a bug and changed the course of human events.
11128,Leonard,We do seem to keep finding room mates.
11129,Howard,But technically yes.
11130,Penny,Okay I’d like to propose a toast to a wonderful girls night out.
11131,Penny,Oh come on. I think it’s nice that Captain Sweatpants showed up to your art opening.
11132,Penny,A day?
11133,Penny,What are you doing at work these days?
11134,Leonard,Sheldon I don’t need an alibi. Nobody’s going to ask about last night as long as you just zip your lip.  Thankyou. Now don’t worry everything is going to be fine. (Sheldon writes “I doubt it” on Leonard’s whiteboard.
11135,Sheldon,The fun loving and morally loose Miss Maggie McGeary.
11137,Penny,Oh my God.
11138,Leonard,Oh don’t flatter yourself. She likes everybody better than she likes me.
11139,Leonard,Yeah if I had contacts I would have been the coolest debate club president ever to be stuffed into his own cello case.
11140,Leonard,It was. By Terminator.
11141,Leonard,I just read online that Arthur Jeffries passed away.
11142,Penny,Look I don’t need a score on a test to make me worry about something I’m already worried about.
11143,Sheldon,Oh not our hike now we have to stay safe and warm.
11144,Penny,You know for a group of guys who claim they spent most of their lives being bullied you can be real jerks. Shame on all of you. 
11145,Penny,No.
11146,Howard,You might be bound by them right now.
11147,Leonard,Yeah except for when I got the foot cramp.
11148,Sheldon,After you used the facilities at the gas station did you make a purchase?
11149,Sheldon,I do. And to show you that there are no hard feelings I am willing to rub my genitals on it as well.
11150,Leonard,Are you crazy? You don’t know who this person is. Delete that.
11151,Sheldon,Yeah. Raj made the funniest joke he said which is the best ladder to use to hang myself?
11152,Sheldon,You want to know my opinion?
11153,Penny,Oh come on.  There butt print.
11154,Penny,Okay look I might be overreacting but how am I supposed to get past this when I know tomorrow you’re gonna go to work and see this woman?
11155,Penny,So are we ready to order?
11156,Howard,What’s happening tomorrow night?
11157,Howard,There are no solar flares right now.
11158,Leonard,Can I help you?
11159,Sheldon,Would it be possible for you to do this a little more quietly?
11160,Sheldon,Just out of curiosity Penny if this experiment does make us fall in love would you drive me to Lake Geneva Wisconsin for Gary Con? It’s the only convention celebrating the life and work of Gary Gygax the co-creator of Dungeons and Dragons.
11161,Leonard,I did have a great time. Thank you for reminding me it’s okay to have fun once in a while.
11162,Leonard,Well what are you thinking of naming it?
11163,Sheldon,Thanks for letting me stay here while Leonard Skypes with his girlfriend.
11164,Sheldon,Oh I hope that’s a rhetorical question because I have no clue.
11165,Sheldon,It’s Penny’s fault.
11166,Sheldon, Penny.
11167,Sheldon,You could make it a train room.
11168,Sheldon,And don’t ever call me Shelly.
11169,Penny,I won’t.
11170,Raj,Oh no. In this game as your careers both took off you drifted apart. Kind of like how future me lost touch with you guys after I became boy toy for the wrinkled but still flexible Madonna.
11171,Howard,Oh so that’s how it works? I have a teeny bladder and now I don’t get a hot girlfriend?
11172,Leonard,Yeah. If you had told anyone that you were going away on a train by yourself across the country do you know what they would have said?
11173,Leonard,Sure. I guess.
11174,Leonard,No offence but shower sex with you is now the second best thing that’s happened today.
11175,Penny,Sorry.
11176,Sheldon,Can’t happen. We have an ironclad relationship agreement which precludes her from physical contact with anyone other than me.
11177,Howard,Oh good. Um can I tell people that our love burned too bright and too quickly? Kind of a Candle in the Wind deal?
11179,Raj,What did you do?
11180,Sheldon,Well my friends are telling me I shouldn’t abandon my girlfriend on her birthday to see the new Star Wars movie.
11181,Sheldon,It’s just a privilege to watch your mind at work.
11182,Raj,No I’m not jealous. All right I’d kill a hobo if it’ll get me laid. Now can we order?
11183,Leonard,And then the the subject got changed somehow.
11184,Sheldon,Very well. Stuart.
11185,Sheldon,Not entirely the fight over who’s going to drive is still…
11186,Sheldon,Did you? I didn’t notice. Have a chocolate.
11187,Penny,Hey um are you sure the guys are okay with me coming?
11188,Sheldon,The last one worked out well for Koothrappali. He got a free iPod. Oh glare!
11189,Penny,Sheldon Amy will you please come join us?
11190,Sheldon,All right I’ll give you that one.
11191,Raj,Yay.
11192,Howard,So you’d do a striptease?
11193,Penny,Okay okay. But you know as a student of psychology who got a check-plus on her first homework assignment I think sometimes it’s good to open up about these things.
11194,Howard,Or totally naked. I love Howard but the dude needs a little shame.
11195,Sheldon,In a world where a piano is a weapon not a musical instrument on what does Scott Joplin play The Maple Leaf Rag?
11196,Raj,Hey uh can I run something by you? It’s about Lakshmi.
11197,Penny,Yeah well it’s your fault.
11198,Penny,Is it possible you might not actually want to meet someone?
11199,Leonard,Uh can I help you?
11201,Sheldon,I guess this is it.
11202,Penny,Oh hey what are you doing here so early?
11203,Howard,And what is your name?
11204,Leonard,Penny? You okay?
11205,Raj,Go Monte! Go Monte!
11206,Sheldon,But now but in my defence…
11207,Howard,It was a nice retirement party.
11208,Howard,During which she defected to North Korea.
11209,Leonard,These are delicious.
11210,Sheldon,No.
11211,Penny,Oh that’s very interesting.
11212,Leonard,Let’s not jump to conclusions. A lot of things start with U.
11213,Sheldon,As I will not be engaging in this nonsense my choice of beverage is moot. But for the record I only drink hot chocolate in months with an R in them.
11214,Raj,Here’s what I wonder about zombies.  What happens if they can’t get any human flesh to eat? They can’t starve to death they’re already dead.
11215,Raj,Don’t you see? When we’re all having fun together we’re already winners. Oh look. See? Even I’m a winner.
11216,Sheldon,Oh wait I found something.
11217,Sheldon,The point of the experiment is to be completely honest with each other.
11218,Leonard,Sheldon are you aware that your sister is an incredibly attractive woman?
11219,Leonard,Yeah I know who it is but why is it me?
11220,Leonard,So what kind of cruise is this you’re going on?
11221,Sheldon,Only 8000? We’re wasting precious time. Buy it.
11222,Raj,Have you seen this Archie comic? It’s actually Archie versus Predator.
11223,Leonard,Oh hello. Join us.
11224,Leonard,Problem?
11225,Howard,You’re right. It should be a cuddly Asian boy. Like me.
11226,Penny,I’m I’m sorry Amy. You were saying something about Howard’s foreskin?
11228,Penny,Oh I’m gonna throw you so hard I might actually win a stuffed animal.
11229,Raj,I don’t think I can walk right now.
11230,Penny,I’m banished? What the hell kind of crap is that?
11231,Penny,You want me to put it back?
11232,Leonard,For God’s sakes. Sheldon come here!
11233,Howard,Well thank you for peeing in my slippers.
11234,Penny,You must know that if Leonard and Leslie want to be together nothing you can do is going to stop it.
11235,Sheldon,I want you to check before you accept the order.
11236,Sheldon,Ooh this is a good one.
11237,Leonard,And it’s the happiest day of our lives.
11238,Raj,Rich parents don’t forget rich parents.
11239,Leonard,Then she stuck her tongue down my throat.
11240,Leonard,Yeah? So?
11241,Sheldon,Well this is highly insulting.
11242,Leonard,Is my coitus whimsically inventive?
11243,Leonard,Did it?
11244,Raj,That’s why I got you hot chocolate.
11245,Leonard,Leonard’s coming down the home stretch! Come on horsey you can do this! Damn. Come on thigh muscles you can do this! Yes! First place. I would have been a great jockey if I weren’t too tall. And scared of horses. Sheldon you’re up.
11246,Howard,Have you tried anything to fix it?
11247,Penny,Okay. Calm down. I’ll go first. All right let’s see. Never have I ever…
11248,Penny,I didn’t get it.
11249,Raj,It’s not always your responsibility. I swear this is the same thing you did at the comic book store last week.
11250,Sheldon,Have you considered studying standard model physics?
11251,Sheldon,You’re not Mr. D’Onofrio. I get my hair cut by Mr. D’Onofrio. You believe this guy?
11252,Penny,So where should we go first?
11253,Sheldon,I play my endless serpent. Raj will play ecstatic frenzy which means Larry will have to play chaos overlord then Captain Sweatpants molten river. I play nightshade dryad game set and match. Now fetch me Wil Wheaton! bortaS bIr jablu’DI’ reH QaQqu’ nay’
11254,Leonard,I’ll send them a basket of muffins.
11255,Raj,I think I swallowed some paint!
11257,Penny,Great. Thank you. Can you pass the salt please?
11258,Leonard,To uh Lucky Baldwin’s.
11259,Penny,All right honey look we’ve known each other for a long time now right? I’ve taken you to Disneyland I kicked a bully in the nuts for you I sing you Soft Kitty when you’re sick you’ve even saw me naked once.
11260,Sheldon,Okay.
11261,Leonard,Aren’t you gonna ask me?
11262,Raj,So why did you guys even agree to the deadline?
11263,Leonard,What are you talking about?
11264,Leonard,Hold on. I put some real work into that!
11265,Penny,No but he will.
11266,Raj,Oh okay great. But if we’re really gonna do a double date then we have to go over some ground rules about Emily.
11267,Penny,But what if you need it?
11268,Sheldon,Well it was a number of things. First the late hour then your demeanour seems very low energy plus your irritability…
11269,Leonard,No. This is the level I am stooping to. I believe that is flag to crotch four checkmate. Easy-peasy ooh so breezy.
11270,Raj,Hey.
11271,Leonard,I guess not.
11272,Penny,Through no one’s fault Sheldon we’re leaving.
11273,Howard,Oh yeah. The guy who lives next to me is always like I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony. But wait until I tell him I’ve got a time machine on my balcony. Stuff that in your speedos Jacuzzi Bob!
11274,Raj,Nothing nothing.
11275,Leonard,Moo-shu is Penny.
11276,Howard,It’s too bad he wasn’t here for that hooker. She’s exactly his type. A hooker. You know I bet if we hired her that would cheer him up.
11277,Penny,Okay right there ew is one of the things you’re not gonna want to say in front of your father-in-law. It’s right up there with icky and get it away. Now pick one up.
11278,Sheldon,He drank from Leonard’s glass. Words they’ll be carving into my tombstone.
11279,Sheldon,See my initial approach to Kripke had the same deficiencies as those that plagued Stu the Cockatoo when he was new at the zoo.
11280,Leonard,D-don’t be silly. We’re neighbours we’re going to run into each other may as well get used to it.
11281,Howard,Excuse me I thought we were trying to solve my problem?
11282,Howard,Maybe you should keep your eye on the ball Papa.
11283,Raj,I’m impressed. This is very lifelike.
11284,Sheldon,Look at this blister. Like it or not we’re athletes now. Besides a bar is where I belong. I’m having female problems.
11285,Raj,Yeah but you were just sleeping because I forboded you to have sex.
11286,Howard,Dude the whole front came off. Now she’s gonna know I was snooping.
11287,Penny,You know what I don’t want to play anymore.
11288,Leonard,Bet if I could make you understand why this is such a cool thing we’d still be together.
11289,Sheldon,Did it work? Are they brain cells yet?
11290,Leonard,You know the best thing about being in a committed monogamous mutually supportive relationship is that even if you have different ideas you can have a spirited debate yet still care for even make love with… 
11291,Penny,Why on earth did you agree to all that?
11292,Penny,That’s all?
11293,Penny,Yeah what is the problem? Is it about getting older?
11294,Leonard,Come on think Leslie.
11295,Penny,I don’t know. I’m kind of hungry.
11296,Leonard,Penny I told you if you don’t put him in his crate at night he just runs around the apartment.
11297,Penny,Well yeah.
11298,Leonard,Yes.
11299,Sheldon,Nothing. I said nothing.
11300,Howard,Oh that sounds great a bed to yourself. Can’t even remember what that’s like.
11302,Howard,Of course not. Look at her.
11303,Sheldon,Stale pastry is hollow succour to a man who is bereft of ostrich.
11304,Leonard,Penny’s still sleeping.
11305,Raj,Hey I plan on levelling up in the game not my swimsuit size thank you very much.
11306,Leonard,I’m afraid so. You know the cashew chicken I get you Monday nights?
11307,Sheldon,As a native Texan I must say I’ve never heard the phrase yee-haw used in quite that context.
11308,Sheldon,Well you seem like a perfectly pleasant person. I just can’t understand why women have such a hard time loving you.
11309,Leonard,If we do we’ll just tell him to hit the bricks see?
11310,Sheldon,Raj? You’ll be there won’t you?  All right then my so-called friends have forsaken me. So I guess it’ll just be me and my eyewitness.
11311,Sheldon,As the kids are saying today talk to the hand.
11312,Raj,Like us?
11313,Howard,It was just a suggestion.
11314,Sheldon,No.
11315,Penny,Aw thank you Daddy. That means so much.
11316,Sheldon,Inconsiderate that is the adjective inconsiderate.
11317,Leonard,All right I tried.
11318,Sheldon,Certainly. Although right now I’m having a rough time because there’s three people in my room and it’s starting to feel like a discotheque.
11319,Sheldon,To my room and no-one’s allowed in.
11320,Leonard,Hello Penny. Hello Kurt.
11321,Leonard,What are you doing?
11322,Sheldon,So I’m thinking you won the Nobel Prize what three years ago? So you must deal with a whole lot of what has Smoot done lately? My thought is we continue my research as a team you know Cooper-Smoot alphabetical and when we win the Nobel Prize you’ll be back on top.
11323,Howard,Okay then.
11324,Leonard,No.
11325,Sheldon,All right I’ll bow to social pressure. Hey!
11326,Sheldon,I know most of your work is extremely derivative. Don’t worry that’s not a secret. Everybody knows.
11327,Leonard,What’s a stadium pal?
11328,Sheldon,Excuse me.
11329,Sheldon,Didn’t they teach you that in medical school?
11330,Raj,Ooh dark matter. We better bring a flashlight. I was making a joke.
11331,Penny,Oh hi.
11332,Leonard,Oh don’t worry. Once you see my sweet moves sex is inevitable.
11334,Leonard,So gas.
11336,Sheldon,Some genius. I zinged him with sarcasm he didn’t even notice.
11337,Leonard,If I’m going to jail I’m killing him not breaking his thumb.
11338,Sheldon,Oh wait. Did you want to talk about what’s bothering you?
11339,Penny,Well wear different pyjamas.
11340,Sheldon,Assuming the device could be invented which would identify the quantum state of matter of an individual in one location and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly you would not have actually transported the individual. You would have destroyed him in one location and recreated him in another.
11341,Raj,It’s not so bad really. At least these trains have modern plumbing. In India you squat over a hole in the train and expose your naked buttocks to the chilly air of Rajasthan.
11342,Sheldon,Of course I’m busy.
11343,Leonard,Um… Raj.
11344,Raj,I did. You said no Bridget Jones.
11345,Sheldon,Thank you. Do either of you know Beyoncé? I’d love her to get behind it.
11346,Sheldon,All right this rust combined with the aluminium recovered from the van is now thermite.
11347,Howard,Grab a corner. Whoa what’s your hurry cowboy? Savour the moment.
11349,Raj,Sure we like fun.
11350,Howard,Nothing rhymes with orange. It’s probably lonely.
11351,Howard,How is that both our names?
11352,Sheldon,We’re just standing behind her. It’s not like we’re gonna say boo and scare her.
11353,Raj,Son of a gun you’re blowing my mind!
11354,Howard,I love you too. We’re good.
11355,Raj,Because I’ve got something even better planned.
11356,Leonard,No.
11357,Penny,And uh extra Dramamine? You remember what happened on It’s a Small World.
11359,Leonard,Who’s miserable and alone?
11360,Leonard,No. Look imagine you maintained a friendship with someone you had sex with but you were free to date whoever you wanted.
11361,Sheldon,There’s a tribe in Papua New Guinea where when a hunter flaunts his success to the rest of the village they kill him and drive away evil spirits with a drum made of his skin. Superstitious nonsense of course but one can see their point. 
11362,Sheldon,I should note I’m having some digestive distress so if I excuse myself abruptly don’t be alarmed. Oh a napkin.
11364,Penny,The people upstairs are moving out.
11365,Leonard,My mother is a highly regarded psychiatrist and I’ve been in therapy ever since she accused me of breast-feeding co-dependently.
11366,Leonard,Yeah sure why not.
11367,Howard,Okay if no-one else will say it I will. We really suck at paintball.
11368,Penny,Oh you know that is so weird that yours came and mine didn’t.  Yup tip your waitresses I’m here all week.
11369,Leonard,That’s enough.
11370,Raj,Oh I really don’t care anymore
11371,Sheldon,Hey now wait. Have we started? Do I drink? What is happening?
11372,Penny,Of course not no he’s not you’re not right Leonard?
11373,Sheldon,I’d like a frozen yogurt please.
11374,Leonard,We talked about it but Howard was in a pretty serious relationship with his mom.
11376,Sheldon,Well no.
11377,Raj,If we’re all gonna die why am I eating so much kale?
11378,Leonard,Trying to paint a picture.
11379,Leonard,It doesn’t matter what I say you’re gonna tell me anyway.
11380,Penny,You’re right. I do have you. Mm. Let’s get married.
11381,Sheldon,Following in the footsteps of Kirk Crunch and Kangaroo. 
11382,Sheldon,Now I’ve got room for another thing. What do you want?
11383,Sheldon,It’s about streetcars? Oh great. I won’t need this. 
11384,Sheldon,Hmm. Did you have anything to eat?
11385,Leonard,Tushy face that is going on Twitter right now.
11386,Sheldon,And if you see any actors from Game of Thrones in first class?
11387,Sheldon,And of those few months how long have you been a demented sex pervert?
11388,Leonard,Doctor what?
11389,Raj,Screw you. Give me back my lima beans.
11390,Raj,Sure you can. Do it! Do it!
11391,Raj,Howard Howard look at the DVD screen. I put on Batman The Animated Series. Your favourite.
11392,Leonard,No it’s true.
11393,Howard,If you do not stop hitting on my lady you will feel the full extent of my wrath.
11394,Penny,Oh God.
11395,Sheldon,How do I do that?
11396,Leonard,You got feet and legs you do it.
11397,Leonard,That’s funny.
11398,Leonard,It’s really sweet what Howard wants to do for Bernadette.
11399,Howard,Okay in Avatar when they have sex in Pandora they hook up their ponytails so we know their ponytails are like their junk.
11400,Raj,So are you worried because he’s replacing you as a son or are you worried because he’s becoming her lover?
11401,Leonard,Isn’t that kind of cowardly?
11402,Howard,Sure.
11403,Leonard,Use your best judgement.
11404,Sheldon,Oh. Well don’t I look silly sitting here wearing this?
11405,Sheldon,Oh. Oh I’ve got that in spades. Ravage me.
11406,Sheldon,So with all those antioxidants what if I run out of oxidants?
11408,Penny,Amy.
11409,Raj,What’s wrong with Mexico?
11410,Sheldon,Would you like one Mrs. Petrescu?
11411,Raj,I would never call Howard.
11413,Sheldon,Yeah. It is good to be home. Oh good lord is that mistletoe? Don’t you maniacs own a calendar?
11414,Sheldon,And now what?
11415,Howard,What were you doing with Priya?
11416,Raj,Your guy Eddie Crispo?
11417,Penny,Oh.
11418,Sheldon,Playing it. I’ve loved the theremin from the first moment I heard the original Star Trek theme. And it’s been killing me that it just sits in my closet gathering dust.
11419,Raj,But we just got tattoos. Wouldn’t we be concerned about bacterial infection?
11420,Sheldon,No. She broke up with me before I could broach the subject.
11421,Sheldon,What’s her name?
11422,Howard,The Archies are over here.
11423,Sheldon,I’ll tell you what if my apples are mealy we’ll hit the produce section for one last crazy blowout. Heck you can even push the cart. Please don’t take my looking forward to Leonard’s return as criticism of the job you’ve been doing in his absence.
11425,Raj,I’m signing off now.
11426,Howard,I think you’re very nice as well.
11427,Howard,Excuse me Ganesh is the remover of obstacles and Shiva is the destroyer. When the smoke clears Abraham Lincoln will be speaking Hindi and drinking mint juleps.
11428,Leonard,I mix pancake batter in this!
11429,Leonard,I did not.
11430,Sheldon,It is just so frustrating.
11431,Penny,Less than I was making at The Cheesecake Factory.
11432,Howard,Don’t start with me dude.
11433,Sheldon,Cheap science fiction?
11434,Howard,Are you impressed by that?
11435,Leonard,Right.
11436,Sheldon,I know. I read it before I threw it out.
11437,Penny,No I’m going to go find your damn roommate before he hurts himself trying to cross the street or something!
11438,Sheldon,Fine. 
11439,Sheldon,Despite my deep love of chess lasers and aerosol disinfectant I must forfeit.
11440,Penny,Stay away from me.
11441,Howard,Why are you holding hands? I forbid you to hold hands.
11442,Leonard,What do you say?
11443,Sheldon,Well now don’t you feel silly.
11444,Sheldon,Yeah well we’re not. We’re an imaginary landing party who had real-life garbage thrown at us by real-life strangers who think we’re idiots. And to tell you the truth I’m starting to feel like one. I want to go home now.
11445,Sheldon,I’m always busy. This mind is capable of advanced multitasking. You know currently I’m attempting to solve the Penrose conjecture I’m composing my Nobel acceptance speech for when I’ve solved the Penrose conjecture and I’m wondering how mermaids have babies.
11446,Sheldon,Do what makes her happy? She plays the harp and her car is paid for. How much happier can she be?
11447,Howard,God I love the smell of paintballs in the morning.
11448,Penny,Ooh I thought I smelled pizza.
11449,Howard,What? You slept with my sister?
11450,Raj,I’m on it.
11451,Raj,No. Is he still mad about the supercollider?
11452,Sheldon,Oh that’s not necessary. You can go first.
11453,Penny,How long has this been going on?
11454,Raj,Also Sheldon may be a robot.
11455,Raj,Uh can I just say I’ve missed all of us hanging out together.
11456,Leonard,Do you know what you need to do now?
11457,Sheldon,Fine. Then I’m going to draw you a nerve-wracking bath of indeterminate temperature.
11458,Howard,Yeah you didn’t have to buy groceries ’cause you were breast-feeding.
11459,Penny,Thanks.
11460,Leonard,Oh get this suddenly Sheldon wants me back because Amy wants to move in with him.
11461,Leonard,Please don’t go there Howard.
11462,Penny,Oh. Gee that’s really sweet but the thing is…
11463,Leonard,Okay now I have to ask. What do they do?
11464,Sheldon,There is no more Sheldon I am the Swordmaster!
11465,Penny,He slipped and fell.
11466,Raj,You can make him do anything you want.
11467,Leonard,Yeah I am loyal. You know if you look at the big picture. Just out of curiosity did he ever have a shot with you?
11468,Sheldon,I like it. Yeah we’ll take the A-M from Amy and uh the Y from Emily.
11469,Penny,Okay so future grief-stricken widow is the one to beat.
11470,Raj,You may want to leave the room.
11471,Leonard,Uh follow-up. Are we still dating?
11472,Penny,Uh pretty good actually.
11473,Raj,Dude it’s not breathing.
11474,Penny,What?
11475,Sheldon,Hello.
11476,Leonard,Uh I was out.
11477,Leonard,Well he pointed out that he kinda sorta had to put up with you.
11478,Leonard,Uh I’m Leonard. This is my friend…
11480,Raj,No. It’s my fault. You know I finally found someone who was right for me and I I drove her away.
11481,Leonard,Hey. What happened? Is Amy gone?
11482,Raj,Yeah well sometimes your jokes hurt.
11483,Howard,It’s a beautiful country. You’d love it. May I join you?
11484,Sheldon,Can you drive me to Pottery Barn?  Maybe if I turn off the night-light I can keep the sheets.
11485,Penny,Um Ach.
11486,Raj,He takes the kitty to the potty?
11487,Leonard,I know and pyramid power and healing crystals.
11488,Penny,Y-you used my loofah?
11489,Sheldon,Viva la Imodium. Ay-ay-ay.
11490,Sheldon,What happened to the Leonard Hofstadter who waited in line with me for 14 hours to see the midnight premiere of Star Trek Nemesis?
11491,Sheldon,An article was just published in Scientific American about our theory.
11492,Penny,I’m helping him relax because unlike you he supports me.
11493,Leonard,Oh dammit my glasses. Okay I’m blind here guys can you help me find them?
11494,Sheldon,Yes. Penny we would very much appreciate it if you would be the fourth member of our Halo team. I don’t think I need to tell you what an honour this is.
11496,Sheldon,How?
11497,Penny,Hmm okay I’m done. How did you guys finish so fast?
11498,Raj,Oh hey thanks for letting me use the comic book store as part of the scavenger hunt.
11499,Leonard,Uh yeah. Sure I guess.
11500,Raj,Rubbish. He’s talking rubbish.
11501,Sheldon,Well as a Texas gentleman I’m inclined to say ladies first. Although I’m concerned that level of politeness and charm might make you fall in love with me before the test even begins. Perhaps we should flip a coin. Or if you’re familiar with the rules of Rock Paper Scissors…
11502,Howard,Yeah you’re missing the point Sheldon.
11503,Penny,Yeah and you can’t tell her what she can and cannot do.
11504,Leonard,Look we could keep fighting and let it ruin our night or or we can stop and try to salvage the evening.
11505,Leonard,No. But there is an original final draft Ghostbusters script with actual slime stains!  Oh you’re right it’s Ghostbusters 2. Never mind.
11506,Penny,I think we can do it.
11507,Howard,I am Shiva the destroyer I will have the woman!
11508,Howard,Are you seriously going to deface your body just for the possibility you could have cheap sex with a strange girl you met in a bar?
11509,Leonard,It gets a bad rap from shows like Jersey Shore and Real Housewives.
11510,Raj,Thank you.
11511,Penny,No she doesn’t.
11512,Raj,It’s like when you bought that remote-controlled helicopter and it just flew away.
11513,Penny,Hey Zack what are you doing here?
11514,Penny,Hey you. What happened with the contacts?
11515,Leonard,Ignore him. How did you get the baby to stop crying?
11516,Penny,No.
11517,Leonard,Excuse me I designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis.
11519,Raj,Cool cool yeah yeah hold on one second.
11520,Sheldon,Al-Ghazali was anti-Aristotelian? Boy you think you know a guy.
11521,Leonard,What is it?
11522,Raj,Not even to sleep?
11523,Leonard,No no no. No Raj go ahead say what you were gonna say.
11524,Howard,Do you kind of look like a shiny Sheldon?
11525,Leonard,There’s Howard’s rocket live from Kazakhstan.
11526,Sheldon,What does it mean?
11527,Howard,Hey Leonard will you please tell Howard my sister’s never been attracted to him.
11528,Raj,Hang on. What do I need to do to make you trust me?
11529,Howard,It’s not like that I’m watching someone’s TV. The Good Wife is on. I tell you this is my new Grey’s Anatomy.
11530,Penny,Yeah I’m trying to be sad about that. I can’t.
11531,Sheldon,She’s so tiny. It’s funny when she’s mad.
11532,Leonard,I’m not being weird. Am I being weird?
11533,Penny,All right hurry up and close the door so they can’t hear us. Would you stop pouting? So you picked my name. Get over it.
11534,Sheldon,It’s what I do. But wait there’s more. I also invented two new chess pieces. The serpent and the old woman.
11535,Sheldon,Physiologically impossible.
11536,Penny,Well you don’t owe me an explanation.
11538,Leonard,You know what? It’s fine.
11539,Howard,Is this just so we won’t touch your stuff while you’re away?
11540,Penny,Yeah.
11541,Leonard,I thought you hate giving gifts.
11542,Penny,No. Wait wait does it?
11543,Leonard,Yes.
11544,Sheldon,Point taken. You may want to sit up.
11545,Raj,Yeah. Sack up dude.
11546,Howard,Screw you. Give me back my lima beans.
11547,Sheldon,At at the lab? Why am I naked from the waist down?
11548,Penny,Yay!
11549,Sheldon,We have no idea what pathogen Typhoid Penny has introduced into our environment. And having never been to Nebraska I’m fairly certain that I have no cornhusking antibodies.
11550,Sheldon,You’re welcome. And any time you need a break from being Bernadette the Pregnant Bernatrix the Warrior Queen is here waiting.
11551,Sheldon,This is a list of your heinous acts against Leonard. One of which is certainly the cause of him wetting his bed well into his teens.
11552,Penny,And astrology.
11553,Leonard,Moo-stache.
11554,Raj,Have you heard from Howard?
11555,Penny,Sheldon Cooper? Tall thin looks a little like a giant praying mantis?
11556,Penny,Kurt put him down this instant.
11557,Howard,Hmm. What if he’s in prison? What if he’s a spy? What if he’s in a Beatles cover band? I’m just saying if he’s got your nose and haircut he’d make a killer Ringo.
11558,Sheldon,You met her at Pasadena’s most popular Irish watering hole Lucky Baldwin’s where Maggie spends her nights tending bar with a head full of curls and a heart full of dreams.
11559,Howard,I thought that too. But then I got my first waffle maker and never questioned her again.
11560,Howard,It’s kind of nice to talk to someone who understands what it feels like to be alone.
11561,Raj,What?
11562,Sheldon,Uh-oh. What if it’s Jennifer Lawrence?
11563,Leonard,Well seeing as your project is to sabotage my project yes.
11564,Leonard,Well I can’t read your mind Penny!
11565,Leonard,Which is?
11566,Howard,You called me feminine. And I I wanted you to think I was more manly.
11568,Sheldon,I did. I told her I texted her I sent out a very emphatic twitter. I even changed my facebook status to Sheldon Cooper wishes Penny would leave him alone. I don’t know what else to do.
11569,Leonard,What.
11570,Howard,What’s your name?
11571,Leonard,You’re being a bully.
11572,Sheldon,I was there. She dumped you.
11573,Howard,Of ghosts no. Of you little bit.
11574,Raj,Is there a good anal leakage?
11575,Leonard,Thanks for not calling the cops.
11576,Leonard,You are so naive. Just like I was seven years ago.  I’d just started at the university.
11577,Howard,I’m okay.
11578,Leonard,Yeah she doesn’t really understand the whole Warcraft adventure-role-playing thing.
11579,Sheldon,But she’s female. Isn’t that the game?
11580,Penny,Leonard…
11581,Penny,Well good for Leonard.
11582,Raj,You know Adam West is my favourite Batman? Well after Michael Keaton Christian Bale and Batman from The Lego Movie.
11583,Penny,I think I’m gonna go for a run you want to come?
11584,Howard,Oh this is like a nightmare. Get lost!
11585,Leonard,Uh he’s not gonna be there. He’s just sending a team to research his theory.
11586,Leonard,Hang on. Are you feeling insecure? Because that’s my thing and if you take it away I don’t know what I’m bringing to this relationship.
11587,Leonard,I wonder if there’s a way we could give the idea a trial run.
11588,Penny,Um he was on Star Trek.
11589,Leonard,That’s enough cardio for me. I’m just gonna stretch out before I hit the weights.
11590,Sheldon,How do you know I’m not using the facilities?
11591,Leonard,I don’t want to wait two days for us to work this out.
11592,Leonard,Aw good for me. Where are you going?
11593,Penny,You are kidding. Raj likes Bernadette?
11594,Howard,Are you asking because you want me there or out of pity? Actually never mind don’t answer. I’d love to.
11595,Raj,Yeah.
11596,Penny,Good.
11597,Sheldon,Doesn’t matter does it?
11598,Leonard,It was the only way to make him happy.
11599,Penny,You stole it?
11600,Sheldon,Point of order. I move that any vote on team names should be unanimous. No man should be forced to emblazon his chest with the bengal tiger when common sense dictates it should be an army ant.
11601,Raj,It’s my one move.
11602,Leonard,I have a board. If you like boards this is my board.
11603,Raj,Oh. Well that’s disappointing.
11604,Raj,A little one. It’s it’s a farewell for Leonard so all the attention will be on him. If you wear something brown and sit on the couch they won’t even know you’re there.
11605,Leonard,Fine. Just enjoy your little game. I’ll make this quest on my own.
11606,Penny,Yeah.
11607,Leonard,What? Then. then why don’t you do it?
11608,Sheldon,We’re going to work this office situation out like gentlemen. And if that doesn’t work I’m going to poison his tea.
11610,Howard,Wail till I Snapchat that my friends might be working on a top secret government project.
11611,Sheldon,Why would you have surgery?
11612,Howard,No I won’t.
11613,Penny,He did?
11614,Leonard,Sheldon you’re not in charge. Raj is in charge.
11615,Sheldon,And when you’re at the gate?
11616,Howard,Oh like you and I did at couples therapy.
11617,Penny,No.
11618,Raj,Oh right uh girlfriend. Okay.
11619,Howard,Why? Because you slept together and when she was done with you she discarded you like last night’s chutney?
11620,Penny,Hey 16 wants to order appetizers.
11621,Raj,Well I’ve always had this fantasy that involves dancing. The sexual chemistry between my partner and me is electric. But boy oh boy does my father not approve until he sees us in the big dance competition.
11622,Sheldon,I won’t. This feels right. My mother always said to thine own self be true.
11623,Raj,She and I were supposed to watch the new Avengers movie tonight but it was sold out. So I said what else do you want to do? She said let’s go to a cemetery and do it on somebody’s grave.
11624,Sheldon,Thank you.
11625,Howard,I feel you. I’ve been dating multiple women.
11626,Raj,You mean so it doesn’t hit the fan?
11627,Howard,So listen to what he wrote. Uh I saw you play at the comic book store. You guys rock. And then there’s an animated smiley face raising the roof like this.
11628,Leonard,I give up.
11629,Raj,Howard wanted to write mumbo jumbo but I said no our Sheldon would say hokum.
11630,Raj,Oh this is cool. So a few weeks ago I set up a fan page on Facebook for our band and…
11631,Raj,No it’s just ever since I started dating Claire and Emily at the same time it’s exhausting.
11632,Sheldon,I’ve got to go with Leonard on this. He is wrong more than anyone I know.
11633,Leonard,You’re still not coming.
11634,Sheldon,Excuse me. This is not about protecting my friend. I’m a big fan of homeostasis. Do you know what that is?
11635,Penny,That is not the definition of professional.
11636,Sheldon,Will someone take me home?
11637,Leonard,What’s going on?
11638,Penny,Well if that’s what you like I’ll take you to the comic book store the place is full of ’em.
11639,Sheldon,I assumed that would be your attitude. Hence my true purpose in coming here.
11640,Leonard,Fine then that.
11641,Sheldon,You’re welcome Penny.
11642,Howard,It doesn’t matter. It’s the thought that counts.
11643,Raj,He’s hanging in there.
11644,Penny,Oh my god no. Why would you ask that?
11645,Sheldon,You’re right That was uncalled for. I take it back.
11646,Howard,What you invited your girlfriend? This is supposed to be our weekend.
11647,Penny,Oh honey it’s not you it’s them.
11648,Sheldon,Oh no no I’m not going back in there. That baby is so irritating. He has literally been crying his entire life.
11649,Sheldon,Mother she’s an atheist not a vampire.
11650,Penny,Yeah I guess they don’t have Sanskrit for butts up and heads down.
11651,Howard,Ooh. Leonard’s going all alpha nerd on Sheldon’s ass.
11652,Penny,Happy birthday anyways. 
11653,Raj,Did you pinky swear?
11654,Penny,I don’t have feelings.
11655,Sheldon,There’s no switch. Just listen and learn.
11656,Sheldon,Thank you. And what is my function as wingman?
11657,Penny,Hi guys.
11658,Howard,I uh I guess you’re probably wondering what’s got me down.
11659,Penny,Uh the couch is good.
11660,Howard,I’ve got him Leonard. Tonight I spice my meat with goblin blood!
11661,Howard,It is and not a lot of comics have a woman with wings breastfeeding a baby right on the cover.
11662,Penny,Oh this? I’m dressed like a slob today.
11663,Sheldon,Oh I’m feeling much better. And I’ve also been continuing to make progress without artificially raising my anxiety levels.
11664,Howard,Sheldon tells it better.
11665,Sheldon,All right I’ll tell you. My goodness everyone’s on their game today.
11666,Sheldon,Morning. I trust you had a pleasant night.
11667,Howard,All right. More Sailor Moon for me.
11668,Sheldon,Oh there it is. It always comes back to monkeys with you. Just monkeys monkeys monkeys.
11671,Howard,Like what?
11672,Sheldon,I understand. You dispute Newton’s claim that he invented calculus and you want to put Gottfried Leibniz on the top.
11673,Leonard,Maybe Koothrappali’s right maybe I embarrass her.
11674,Sheldon,And Amy doesn’t look sick.
11676,Penny,So big.
11677,Penny,Ugh it was the worst trip everyone got sick over the weekend.
11678,Leonard,You seen Sheldon?
11679,Leonard,Excuse me could you help us out?
11680,Leonard,The only time I eat this well is when my mom’s in town and she takes me out to dinner.
11681,Sheldon,That’s not the secret knock. This is the secret knock. 
11682,Leonard,That’s incredible.
11683,Sheldon,Oh! If I’m wrong prove it.
11684,Penny,Who’s Armin the miniature horse breeder?
11685,Raj,I don’t know. Maybe.
11686,Leonard,Of course you must.
11687,Leonard,Raj.
11688,Howard,Okay I think I got it. 
11689,Howard,If you don’t want to meddle then why are you meddling.
11690,Penny,They started to then her water broke. You know if he finds out we eloped it’s gonna break his heart.
11691,Raj,Wow that’s heavy.
11692,Howard,Wait you don’t remember?
11693,Sheldon,Well you don’t like Princess Corncob you don’t like Fester you’re just impossible to please.
11694,Raj,Oh so that’s how it works? I have a teeny bladder and now I don’t get a hot girlfriend?
11695,Leonard,Ladies do love a man dressed like a kitchen garbage bag. Oh no.
11696,Leonard,How about an acetylene torch?
11697,Raj,Welcome to the Raj Mahal.
11698,Penny,Uh chips.
11699,Penny,Well good because that’s what I did.
11700,Howard,Okay who had Leonard gets a floppy disk?
11701,Leonard,That’d be great. Thank you.
11702,Leonard,No hang on hang on.  See!
11703,Leonard,Oh no he’s going to telecommute. Everybody’s really excited about it.
11704,Raj,Hey.
11705,Leonard,Actually my tests of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum interference effect have reached an interesting point. Right now we’re testing the phase shift due to an electric potential.
11706,Sheldon,May I interject something here?
11707,Leonard,Hey can you open this for me?
11708,Howard,Hey don’t bag on Sandra Bullock! You think it makes you look cultured but you just come off as bitter.
11709,Leonard,Okay fine. Just the sword two ten.
11710,Sheldon,What’s your point?
11711,Raj,I have to say I am happy with your OBGYN.
11712,Raj,Good idea. Bernadette?
11713,Penny,Okay here’s the deal we are going to throw Leonard a kick-ass surprise party for his birthday on Saturday.
11715,Penny,How come you never eat broccoli?
11716,Raj,No I’m still dating her.
11717,Sheldon,William Shatner.
11718,Raj,It doesn’t matter. It’s the thought that counts.
11719,Howard,I did shut up. Now you shut up.
11720,Sheldon,You know in fact I’d like to propose a toast. To Stuart. A fine man a good friend and a wonderful guest.
11721,Penny,Yeah okay cool. I don’t need the PBS special I just want to know enough so I can talk to Leonard about his job. You know like Bernadette does.
11722,Leonard,Hmm. Who knows? That’s exciting. I’ll get to wake up every morning and see if he’s still here.
11723,Sheldon,I think you’re high on paint fumes. And boy that’s a lot of Band-Aids.
11724,Raj,Well what if something were to happen to this boy so he was no longer a threat to Sheldon?
11725,Penny,Hey Leonard.
11726,Leonard,And just leave him here alone?
11727,Leonard,Not always but ever since he wandered off at the swap meet chasing a balloon I get worried.
11728,Sheldon,I’m not sure how I feel about Howard being dungeon master instead of you.
11729,Sheldon,And that’s not helpful. You know I got her an iPhone for Christmas. I’ll see where she is.
11730,Sheldon,Seems a little confrontational but all right. You know we won’t be very far from Skywalker Ranch.
11731,Howard,You always say that but we never do.
11732,Penny,Well what if we do go out and I do something stupid and dump you again?
11733,Sheldon,Okay assuming we could dance which we can’t there are three of us and two of them.
11734,Leonard,Tina?
11735,Leonard,Then of course rubbing our success in Sheldon’s face.
11737,Leonard,Because one of the great minds of the twenty-first century is raising glow-in-the-dark fish and weaving sarapes.
11738,Howard,What do you say Howard?
11739,Sheldon,Oh come on you can’t tell me that you’re not intrigued about the possibility of building a better girlfriend.
11740,Raj,No it’s okay. I don’t have to go. I’m happy just to guide you and your ladies to suitable entertainment choices. I’m a walking brown Yelp.com.
11741,Sheldon,No I’m not okay. Uh I’m wearing borrowed pants I don’t have I.D. and one of the officers here won’t stop calling me chicken legs.
11742,Raj,Oh uh hi Penny. Yes please.
11743,Sheldon,Yes Cuddles. We cuddled. Grow up Leonard.
11744,Penny,So Dr. Koothrappali long flight?
11745,Leonard,Okay well what exactly did this guy write not that I need to know the details of your sex life I just thought…. never mind.
11746,Leonard,Where did you get that?
11747,Sheldon,Okay now you’re getting creative.
11748,Penny,What am I supposed to say?
11749,Sheldon,Oh dear Lord. Oh dear Lord.
11750,Sheldon,Hmm technically not a fruit but all right. Where did you do your medical internship?
11751,Leonard,So. Hot in India?
11752,Penny,Oh my God that’s perfect. ‘Cause I have so many clothes I don’t wear and they’re just taking up space and I go shopping to buy more stuff and I have no place to put it. This will totally fix that.
11753,Sheldon,Here drink slash eat this.
11754,Raj,This is gonna be so much more accurate than the steam room at the gym.
11755,Raj,No.
11756,Sheldon,Undoubtedly yet another snide response to my repeated letters complaining that the flags in front of the courthouse are flying in the wrong order. From left to right it’s supposed to be federal state and then city of Pasadena.
11757,Howard,Though if you did it’s more zeroes than you’re expecting.
11758,Raj,Ha! Eat my dust racially stereotypical plumber.
11759,Raj,Runs from stones means that that big boulder but I couldn’t rhyme anything with boulder.
11760,Penny,I know. I want to talk to you.
11761,Sheldon,Actually I came to speak to Mrs. Davis.
11762,Howard,Howard and Bernadette the five of us stand before you as your friends and newly ordained ministers.
11763,Raj,Good good. Uh listen I just wanted to let you know when you get my credit card bill it might be a little high this month.
11764,Penny,Okay.
11765,Leonard,Because you’re taking all the fun out of it.
11766,Sheldon,Oh of course it only works on the weak-minded.
11767,Raj,I’m not pouting I’m brooding. Which is how sexy men pout.
11768,Sheldon,Oh!
11769,Sheldon,Well I hope you’re satisfied Penny. You are responsible for all the evil that has befallen me today.
11770,Sheldon,Did you know the singular of confetti is confetto?
11771,Sheldon,When I’m not home.
11772,Sheldon,That’s an easy guess. I’m clearly an annoying person and have problems with both genders.
11773,Raj,You know you you and I you and I have a lot in common.
11774,Sheldon,Um Penny that’s where I sit.
11775,Sheldon,Leonard Penny excellent. I’d like to say I’m very happy that you’re back together and if I can figure out a way to do so and sound sincere I will. In the meantime I’d like to go over some proposed changes to the roommate agreement specifically to address Penny’s annoying personal habits.
11776,Penny,Uh thanks but I think I’m gonna stay in and go over the stuff Bernadette gave me.
11777,Penny,Oh good. Check it out The Disappointing Child by Beverly Hofstadter.
11778,Sheldon,Need you ask? But I still don’t understand why no-one else bid.
11779,Sheldon,These are market research questions. I’m filling out the online registration for your game.
11780,Leonard,How does he keep coming up with new ways to be annoying?
11781,Leonard,Priya’s going back to India.
11782,Leonard,I think Blinky’s cute.
11783,Sheldon,Look at me look at me I’ve got goosebumps.
11784,Leonard,Okay I can’t do this.
11785,Howard,I’m so lonely.
11786,Raj,I’ll stick with eleven. She liked Howard better.
11787,Raj,Can we please talk about anything else?
11788,Sheldon,Three.
11789,Sheldon,If you’re referring to the beverage you know I don’t drink. If you’re referring to the hat you don while wearing a nightshirt and holding a candle I have one.
11791,Sheldon,So what’d you think?
11792,Raj,Owner father soul mate and if anything happens to her your worst nightmare.
11793,Leonard,They’re gonna find out about me eventually right?
11794,Leonard,No. You need to give me some advice.
11795,Sheldon,What if they cut the power?
11796,Leonard,The world may have forgotten about Dance Dance Revolution but not this smooth criminal.
11797,Howard,No.
11798,Leonard,All right here you go.
11799,Leonard,Folding a sheet in my underwear still pretty crazy.
11800,Leonard,All that story does is make me feel bad for your mother.
11801,Sheldon,How’s counting going? When I was in kindergarten I recited pi to a thousand places for the school talent show. I think I got this.
11802,Raj,If you people think this is better than Tom Hanks-giving you’re all crazy.
11803,Leonard,Really? You waited months for time with that telescope. What happened?
11804,Leonard,Sheldon what channel is NASA TV?
11805,Howard,The space probe.
11806,Penny,Almost done.
11807,Leonard,Because the cafeteria doesn’t offer little packets of methamphetamine.
11808,Leonard,Focus on the game not the commercials Raj.
11809,Penny,Okay. That’s enough. You know what? What is going on?
11810,Raj,It was tapenade and you guys suck.
11811,Leonard,Oh. Watch out Sheldon. This little boy Casper is a g-g-g-ghost!
11812,Leonard,I could use some help.
11813,Leonard,Come on it doesn’t have to be a good friend. And you know that deep down inside Howard’s a really nice guy.
11814,Sheldon,Then why didn’t you say that?
11815,Leonard,Aw. Here’s what I think of your roommate agreement.
11816,Penny,Hey what’s this?
11817,Leonard,I went to your office Christmas party?
11818,Sheldon,Excuse me. When I come back just for fun the subject will be alternative history. Specifically how would the civil war have gone differently if Lincoln had been a robot sent from the future?  Look at that there’s even pasta left over.
11819,Sheldon,Well first of all you can’t use relativistic and non-relativistic vectors in the same equation.
11820,Penny,Sheldon you didn’t tell me your mom was coming.
11821,Raj,Got it. Take care. I guess I have no choice but to make sweet guilt-free love to you over and over again for the rest of my life.
11822,Sheldon,Thank you.
11823,Leonard,Uh sleep night. I mean obviously good night. I started to say sleep tight then I changed my mind in the middle. I swear to God I’m smart.
11824,Penny,Uh we ran out of candy on Halloween I was just giving everything away.
11825,Leonard,Eh that just means going barefoot.
11826,Leonard,Watch out.
11827,Sheldon,If I remember correctly Captain Kirk will steal a cloaking device from the Romulans on Stardate 5027.3 which will be January 10th 2328 by pre-federation reckoning.
11828,Penny,You know the only thing worse than doing a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass is getting fired from a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass.
11829,Howard,Yeah anything is better than this.
11830,Raj,Aah! It’s eating his face!
11831,Penny,He looked at me like this.
11832,Penny,Hi.
11833,Leonard,Wuh I don’t…. th-th-th-that’s really two different questions uh I’m not…. Sheldon we have to go!
11834,Leonard,Men do things for women without expecting sex.
11835,Raj,Hi.
11836,Raj,Kripke? Is that you?
11837,Penny,All right you would think the only adult wouldn’t let something silly ruin our entire night.
11838,Howard,Ah the premature I love you.
11839,Leonard,There’s nothing wrong with the science here.
11840,Leonard,So you agree he’s nuts.
11841,Sheldon,Quick poll PS4 or Xbox One? Raj?
11842,Raj,Yeah come on this is great news and you know it.
11843,Sheldon,I’m not unhappy.
11844,Raj,Do either of you ladies enjoy the novels of John Grisham?
11845,Penny,What gave you the right to mix my DNA with that of a killer gorilla?
11846,Sheldon,Talk to him.
11847,Raj,No I grew up with a house full of servants and now I have a cleaning lady who is a lovely woman who I have great respect for.
11848,Penny,How is it supposed to be a dance if I’m the only girl?
11849,Sheldon,Do you understand how important Hawking is to me? When I was six years old I dressed up as him for Halloween.
11851,Penny,Oh is that it?
11852,Leonard,Well hang in there maybe you’ll evolve into something with wings.
11853,Leonard,I think it upsets Sheldon when you play with the food.
11854,Raj,What right do you have to pick who I can have children with?
11855,Sheldon,Yeah from when we went to the arcade three years ago? I finally decided what prize I want. Hurry up.
11856,Sheldon,Well if you hate it then why are you doing it? Although I could ask the same question about coitus with Leonard.
11857,Sheldon,Fine. What about epilepsy?
11858,Leonard,I love you too.
11859,Penny,There you go.
11860,Raj,Like what?
11861,Leonard,What’s going on with that woman you’re dating?
11862,Penny,Well you’re the first guy he’s ever really approved of you know? You’re a scientist who went to college and you don’t have a neck tattoo or outstanding warrants or or a baby.
11863,Leonard,Just a minute. This tray contains clues as to what you and I are going to be doing on Valentine’s Day.
11864,Raj,Good good. Then you have nothing to worry about.
11865,Sheldon,Well no wonder the women are winning.
11866,Leonard,Okay that I believe.
11867,Howard,Oh there it is now that you don’t have a girlfriend you want to hang out with me again.
11868,Raj,Ah no problem. It wouldn’t be Thanksgiving without an Indian providing the food. Uh now where does your mom keep the Crisco?
11869,Howard,That’s a fair point. We wouldn’t make fun of someone like this to their face.
11870,Sheldon,I’m trying I’m counting catwomen. She did make a fine mutant in the X-Men movies though.
11871,Sheldon,Oh you’re hardly out of the woods no. You still run the risk of infection a blood clot the possibility that an inattentive surgeon let a barn spider lay eggs in your nose. The minute you sneeze web I’m moving out.
11872,Penny,That sounds nice.
11873,Leonard,Okay well once again you guys have a good… whatever this is.
11874,Leonard,You just happen to have those in the car?
11876,Raj,Wow what a bunch of Nosey O’Donnells.
11877,Leonard,Ay papi? What is that?
11878,Penny,And you thought it was soaping me up in the shower.
11879,Penny,Oh we’re glad you had fun.
11880,Penny,Yes you can.
11881,Leonard,Bring it on.
11882,Raj,Shall I wait?
11883,Penny,Whoa wait wait wait. I did not start dating at 15.
11884,Sheldon,Uh um uh thank you all so much for coming. Beverly. Wil Wheaton. Adam West for some reason.
11885,Raj,And a large number of people will believe it never happened.
11886,Sheldon,Leonard I was just mentioning an interesting local news item. Now thanks to you I’m worried Amy’s been eaten by a bobcat.
11887,Sheldon,Off the top of my head? Uh prospective women weed themselves out in a battle of wits until only one champion remains and she shows up at my door flush with the thrill of victory and then sits quietly by my side while I watch Daredevil.
11888,Penny,Really do you think I overreacted?
11889,Raj,Yeah it’s also a wand.
11890,Leonard,Like times two twice?
11891,Howard,Yeah.
11892,Sheldon,Interesting. See one more question and perhaps I should have led with this when did we become friends?
11893,Penny,Thank you so much for coming.
11894,Leonard,Physics. .
11895,Leonard,Not once did my mother ever give me any love or affection for just being myself I always had to earn it.
11896,Leonard,Damn it.
11897,Raj,Okay that’s enough. Write down loving son.
11898,Leonard,Come on guys push.
11899,Sheldon,But you only have two eyes. You got a lot of nostril hairs.
11900,Penny,Um yeah sure thanks.
11901,Sheldon,This is disconcerting.
11902,Howard,The… the picture’s breaking up.
11903,Raj,I do. I just wouldn’t tell my girlfriend.
11904,Sheldon,Yeah well that is exactly what I’ve been doing the last five years with this little work in progress.
11905,Leonard,Some guy is auctioning off a miniature time machine prop from the original film and no-one is bidding on it.
11906,Leonard,Short and sexy that’s my wheelhouse.
11908,Penny,You got fingers and a mouth you call her.
11909,Howard,Isn’t there a university policy against dating graduate students?
11910,Leonard,Oh who am I kidding I can’t go through with this you need to call her and cancel.
11911,Sheldon,Excellent.
11912,Howard,No.
11913,Penny,Too bad.
11914,Sheldon,Amusing. A play on the two meanings of cobbler.
11915,Sheldon,I’ve decided you’re right. My career is not over.
11916,Howard,I’m telling you dude the song has no groove you can’t dance to it.
11918,Sheldon,Look Leonard Penny made French toast.
11919,Leonard,Since when do you hum songs?
11920,Leonard,We’re out of ice.
11921,Leonard,Hey. What’s going on?
11922,Howard,Are you willing to risk it?
11923,Leonard,Sheldon aren’t you going to introduce us?
11924,Raj,Excuse me. I can’t be drinking I’m about to make an important scientific discovery here.
11925,Sheldon,Why?
11926,Leonard,What did your mother say when you told her you were getting married?
11927,Sheldon,I look forward to your next birthday when we do it again.
11928,Penny,Yeah you might be right. But back to you. I know you think you’re some sort of smooth-talking ladies’ man but the truth is you are just pathetic and creepy.
11929,Leonard,Just do it ’cause he’s not gonna let it go.
11930,Raj,Uh Sheldon…
11931,Leonard,You have no idea who he is do you?
11932,Penny,Okay.
11933,Raj,Thank you sir. 
11934,Leonard,Just when I thought you couldn’t get any hotter.
11935,Leonard,Hey if you can find a book called weird sex with white boys I’d be okay with that.
11936,Sheldon,Really? Leonard there are no heroes when it comes to dermatitis.
11937,Leonard,You want it you got it oh you want it baby you got it
11938,Howard,Teams are fun.
11939,Sheldon,Excuse me I’m thirsty so I’m going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage.
11940,Sheldon,Just remember with great power comes great responsibility.
11941,Leonard,Well uh I can’t believe you used Sheldon’s toothbrush.
11942,Leonard,The same way I know that the people in the TV set can’t see me.
11943,Leonard,Yes yeah exactly the girlfriend experience.
11944,Leonard,Well let’s start small. We can always add more.
11945,Leonard,We did but there were extenuating circumstances.
11946,Raj,Can I tell her I miss her?
11947,Leonard,You know you’re right. I mean it’s from you I’m never going to sell it. I’m opening it.
11948,Leonard,Has it ever worked?
11949,Leonard,Okay my turn. Your dad wrote about how family is the most important thing and that you should never throw it away like he did.
11950,Penny,What are you doing?
11951,Howard,That is so not true.
11952,Howard,Well how could you not put in an abort?
11953,Sheldon,Just pick out anything? Maybe at the same time we can pick out a new suit for him without knowing his size or pick out his career for him without knowing his aptitude or pick out a new breakfast cereal without knowing his fibre requirements or his feelings about little marshmallows.
11954,Sheldon,I’ve taken the liberty of scripting your appearance on the witness stand because let’s face it you’re somewhat of a loose cannon. Now don’t worry it’s written in your vernacular. So shall we rehearse?
11955,Sheldon,Okay. I have guests coming. I’m afraid I’m going to have to ask you to leave now.
11956,Penny,Uh no not yet. There’s still a few people I haven’t told personally.
11957,Leonard,Excuse me?
11958,Penny,Amelia and the time-trav… found it. It was just past dawn on the prairie and like every morning Amelia prepared to do her chores. Except something about this morning felt different.
11959,Leonard,Ha ha. Leonard and I are about to see Suicide Squad. Spoiler alert when I see you I’m gonna spoil it. You’re a good friend.
11960,Sheldon,I’m a callous egomaniac. She’s gonna leave me.
11961,Sheldon,Gentlemen I’ve got Amy up and running. Shall we get to work?
11962,Leonard,Do you know how much your car costs?
11963,Sheldon,You’re not doing it for me. You’re doing it for future generations who will benefit from my struggle.  Sheldon’s Mine Simulation Log entry four. My Kit Kat has melted. All is lost.
11964,Howard,Oh please allow me. That’s a lot of empty calories.
11965,Penny,Cheers.
11966,Sheldon,Okay.
11967,Sheldon,No it is. Leonard pointed out to me that I’m not always a loving and supportive boyfriend so here’s some quality luggage.
11968,Sheldon,I’m okay. How was the funeral?
11969,Leonard,Well it sounded like you were having a rough day so i wanted you to come home to something nice.
11970,Sheldon,I need eggs. Four dozen should suffice.
11972,Leonard,No we’re not going to Long Beach.
11973,Penny,Well the fact is you can’t.
11975,Penny,Um you know it’s kind of early. Do you want to maybe come in for some coffee or something?
11976,Sheldon,Are you saying that you want me to be Professor Proton?
11977,Sheldon,You’re right of course.
11978,Raj,Sorry doesn’t make up for the fact that I had to make chicken and rice with this vegan guy. Do you know what vegan chicken and rice is? Rice!
11979,Leonard,Sheldon you need to learn how to drive.
11980,Penny,Can I stay at your place for a few nights?
11981,Penny,You know there’s an Olive Garden down the street. You guys should try it sometime.
11982,Sheldon,I have a feeling you’re still doing it. But I find that topic irresistible so now in ancient Mesopotamia the king referred to the people as his property.
11983,Leonard,Right anyway uh with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere we had something we wanted to ask you. Sheldon?
11984,Howard,You better be. No jokes about how close I am with my dog. Or the truth about how close I am with my dog.
11985,Leonard,I wouldn’t.
11986,Howard,And this is Leonard and Sheldon’s apartment.
11987,Leonard,How exactly would that laugh go?
11988,Penny,I called your old high school and convinced them to let you give your speech over Skype.
11989,Penny,Who says something like that right in the middle of sex?
11990,Howard,Are possums cute?
11991,Raj,Hey I was being hypothetical okay? I would never marry you.
11992,Sheldon,Can’t talk. In the zone.
11993,Sheldon,Here’s something else you don’t know about me. You just hurt my feelings.
11994,Leonard,What’s going on?
11995,Raj,What did you do? Did you change the contrast or brightness settings on the television?
11996,Raj,Yeah no but it is basic human nature. If we present him as a prize maybe they would.
11997,Raj,Yeah I’m making a bunch of changes. This morning I fired my dog walker.
11998,Sheldon,Yes enjoy your japes gentlemen. You think you’ve poked fun at a milquetoast academic. Well you’ve forgotten one thing. I am also a son of the Lone Star state. I’m Texas through and through. And we know how to settle scores down there. If you doubt me ask Mexico.
11999,Sheldon,It wasn’t. His wife set their dogs on me and rendered the question moot.
12000,Penny,Well go ahead. He’s right over there.
12001,Sheldon,Fine. Two years ago I got my driver’s license.
12003,Sheldon,I am cool. This is Yoo-hoo chocolate milk’s delicious watery cousin.
12004,Sheldon,My pleasure Ira.
12005,Sheldon,Please no nothing so pedestrian. I wanted a griffin.
12006,Leonard,I can’t believe she would say that about me.
12007,Raj,Oh can I show her an oil painting I made of us surrounded by our children and grandchildren?
12009,Penny,Okay I’m an actress. Ask me again.
12010,Leonard,Ooh Emily. I heard him say that to Emily. Hey I thought you were staying home.
12011,Sheldon,Curiouser and curiouser.
12012,Leonard,That is a problem.
12013,Howard,Aw there’s a thing.
12014,Raj,What do you think the problem is?
12015,Sheldon,Well little lady you’ve heard of party hearty get ready to party hardly.
12016,Penny,Ooh. You’re gonna make out so hard tonight.
12017,Raj,Got it. Now uh I have a question about the song. I was thinking at some point I could bust out a little rap.
12018,Sheldon,You may have a point. I love my mother. Even if she fornicates like a demonic weasel.
12019,Sheldon,Yeah which he rudely announced on my flag show. People were so upset about it no one else called in the rest of the night.
12020,Leonard,Fish nightlights.
12021,Sheldon,Well he’s even more cunning than we thought.
12022,Penny,Really? What was your first clue?
12023,Sheldon,Social niceties have been suspended Leonard. We’re in a state of a emergency. The world has descended into darkened turmoil. Lawlessness and savagery are the order of the day.
12024,Raj,Well it’s a lot better than having to wear noise-cancelling headphones in my own apartment.
12025,Leonard,How would I be blinded?
12026,Sheldon,Interesting. Very interesting.
12027,Penny,Oh my God.
12028,Leonard,Okay bye-bye.
12029,Penny,No. Once these puppies touch the ground they’re mine and I’ll have to wear them walking up and down Hollywood Boulevard in order to pay them off. Pretty pretty pretty.
12030,Raj,You slipped and fell into a robot hand?
12032,Leonard,Come on Sheldon it’ll be fun.
12033,Leonard,Yeah you can’t stay in your apartment for the rest of your life.
12034,Sheldon,I believe the condensation on your frozen foods weakened the structural integrity of the bag. But returning to your key conundrum perhaps you should call a locksmith and have him open the door for you.
12035,Sheldon,Oh yummy yummy! We should do this more often. Uh-oh.
12036,Penny,Yes. Look up at the sign and remember improv is always about saying yes.
12037,Sheldon,All right this goes against everything I stand for but desperate times call for desperate measures. Lord this is Sheldon Cooper. You’re good friends with my mom. I know I’ve spent my life denying that you exist.
12038,Leonard,Okay. Well how about this? Kidnap Bernadette from the opera wearing a creepy mask so she doesn’t know it’s you.
12039,Sheldon,The whole point of a secret knock is to establish a non-verbal signal to verify the identity of one’s co-conspirators.
12040,Howard,Uh excuse me Mrs. Davis?
12042,Leonard,Hi.
12043,Sheldon,Not to worry. I hid it. Bazinga! You’re in my spot.
12044,Howard,250 million years.
12045,Raj,But uh before I take my shirt off I just need like ten minutes to do some crunches.
12046,Sheldon,Amazing an intelligent labradoodle.
12047,Sheldon,Leonard disproved my element. Now all the attention is going to go away.
12048,Sheldon,Can’t help a friend out in a time of need huh? I see where your therapist was coming from.
12049,Howard,Thanks. I love hockey.
12050,Sheldon,The only flaw in an otherwise perfect plan. Now get my back Jack.
12051,Howard,You’re a sucky friend you know that? A sucky sucky friend.
12052,Penny,Should we take this little party to the bedroom?
12053,Penny,Thanks.
12054,Sheldon,Heated to precisely 183 degrees?
12055,Sheldon,Very well. Count the first on or about the 28th day of April the accused did knowingly and with malice aforethought deny access to the shared bathroom in a time of emergency to wit my back teeth were floating. Count the second the accused exceeded the agreed upon occupancy of the shower to wit one unless we are under attack by water-soluble aliens.
12056,Penny,Yeah Amy told me what happened. Look just apologize. It’ll warm her twaddle.
12057,Penny,Well maybe that’s what I was going for.
12058,Leonard,Oh hey Sheldon.
12059,Sheldon,No. I need to get you down for a nap. And for some reason that VapoRub gets you all fired up. 
12060,Sheldon,Howard has announced his intention to propose marriage to Bernadette.
12061,Sheldon,I also now have three points on a driver’s licence I do not yet possess and I was forced to issue an undeserved apology simply because I refuse to urinate in a stainless steel bowl in front of criminals.
12062,Penny,Brawny?
12063,Sheldon,Alright alright well just sit down yes sit down now close your eyes.
12064,Penny,Yeah?
12065,Sheldon,And here’s another interesting weather fact.
12066,Sheldon,Um can I have your attention everyone?  That’s uh B-flat for those who don’t have perfect pitch. I would like to propose a toast to my best friend Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. He has been presented with a wonderful opportunity and I couldn’t be happier for him.
12067,Howard,Okay. I know. It was me. I I pushed too hard. I’m sorry.
12068,Penny,Okay. Well bye. 
12069,Penny,Fine? You said it was fine?
12070,Leonard,Feel is a kind of a… it’s a strong word. Um I just think it would be a nice gesture on your part.
12071,Leonard,Is it a secret bank account? Because that would be awesome.
12072,Penny,Oh yeah right. Lock up your daughters or Sheldon might lecture them about the North American Free Trade Agreement.
12074,Howard,How so?
12075,Sheldon,Amy has a fondness for the comic strip Marmaduke.
12076,Leonard,Come on trust me he’s hitting on you.
12077,Leonard,No no not at all. A little bit.
12078,Howard,Well what do you want to write?
12079,Penny,Why? Do you not want me to go?
12080,Sheldon,Thank you Penny. You know I just need to keep reminding myself that Bert’s success is not my failure.
12081,Sheldon,Leonard no sleep while I play bongos. Bongo solo.
12082,Sheldon,Like when?
12083,Penny,Oh your buddy got mugged by some baby farm animals.
12084,Leonard,Didn’t you say you’re making hydrogen sulphide gas?
12085,Sheldon,Excuse me.
12086,Leonard,Are you kidding me? I already have two strikes.
12087,Howard,It’s just that they’ve had plenty of help.
12088,Penny,Okay so while we were going out how often would you pretend to like things just to have sex with me?
12089,Sheldon,Wowza.
12090,Sheldon,Do they know it’s there? I mean should I tell somebody?
12091,Sheldon,Oh hello. What can I do for you ladies?
12092,Howard,Oh I really don’t care anymore
12093,Raj,It’s got a big bird on it dude.
12094,Penny,Nope got to go with Amy on this one.
12095,Penny,Yeah so is Sheldon.
12096,Sheldon,No but I’m also closer to the entrance in case of attack.
12097,Leonard,Hey all set. What do you think? There’s plenty of room for everybody a view out the window.
12098,Sheldon,Oh no.
12099,Leonard,Why not?
12100,Penny,You didn’t do anything. It’s Sheldon.
12101,Penny,Yes.
12102,Sheldon,You’re right. I’m smart as a whip. I should be able to figure this out.
12103,Howard,Haven’t you been listening to me I cannot talk to women.
12104,Sheldon,Use the force Sheldon. Use the force.  I’m gonna need more force.
12105,Penny,Is there any part of your body that’s normal?
12106,Sheldon,Mmm.
12107,Leonard,Well it turns out she really knows how to help a guy loosen up and have a good time. Although truth be told my groin’s a little worse for wear.  Ow! Why did you do that?
12108,Sheldon,No no. I’ll finish making the tea while you narcissistically ramble on about whatever’s troubling you.
12109,Leonard,Now we’re getting somewhere.
12110,Raj,You know checking e-mail updating my facebook status messing up wikipedia entries. Hey did you know Netflix lets you stream movies on your computer now?
12111,Penny,Oh you did didn’t you?
12112,Penny,You think?
12113,Leonard,Uh oh gee my initial reaction is no. You know let me think about it and get back to you okay?
12114,Sheldon,I don’t believe it matters what the topic is. What’s crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way. It’s all about the execution.
12115,Leonard,I’m telling you you got this.
12116,Penny,Why?
12117,Leonard,You’re right. I’m sorry. We have the rest of our lives to dredge stuff up from the past and fight about it. So what do you think? Should we run next door and grab a bite?
12118,Raj,You! Always bet on black.
12119,Penny,Uh well it’s just that the physicists I know are indoorsy and pale.
12120,Howard,Where would you go?
12121,Sheldon,I feel like I know what song that is but I can’t put my finger on it.  My country ’tis of thee. No.
12122,Howard,A total loser. Obviously a guy with a six-shooter beats an old man with a magic wand.
12123,Sheldon,Oh well you know that is interesting. I wonder what kind of infection you’ll come home with. My money’s on fungal. They’re still having girls night across the hall.
12124,Leonard,Yeah it’s a perfectly good word. You put it in front of wine or dining and you’ve really got something. Okay well let me ask you this how was last night for you?
12125,Sheldon,It isn’t Meemaw. Sorry Leonard.
12126,Leonard,Really? How many grown-ups do you know who have Mr. Spock oven mitts? Hey the recipes are on my iPad. Will you pull ’em up?
12127,Penny,Oh I don’t think I’ll be able to stop thinking about it.
12128,Sheldon,All right you have to get out of the car right now. I’m not going to jail for you.
12129,Leonard,Really? What do we tell Siebert?
12130,Sheldon,Since we come in every Tuesday night at six o’clock and order the same exact thing and it’s now six oh eight I believe your question not only answers itself but also stands alongside such other nonsensical queries as who let the dogs out? and uh How are they hanging?
12131,Penny,Yeah you’d think that but after a while it starts showing up in your dreams.
12132,Raj,Has your uh assistant said anything about me?
12133,Sheldon,Okay this isn’t at all good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who’s just respawned you need to give them a chance to  now come on!
12134,Sheldon,It’d be swell if they had a train.
12135,Sheldon,Seven years ago I found out the DVD was late and I paid for it.
12136,Penny,I don’t care about Alex. Fine I care. Okay I hate that bitch. But what really hurt is that you liked it so much. I mean do I need to be worried?
12137,Leonard,Did you have fun? Because if you had fun then you are you are a winner. Now that’s that-that’s what chess is all about.
12138,Penny,Okay Amy you’re being silly. I am not concerned about who hangs out with who. And I certainly don’t have a problem with Leonard’s new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup. Ooh these are cute. Of course if I buy them I’ll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple.
12139,Sheldon,Well you barely looked. Let me see.
12140,Sheldon,Oh dear!
12141,Leonard,I’m going to get some fries. You want anything?
12142,Leonard,Yeah. It’s okay I guess.
12143,Penny,It’s just one history class. Look I didn’t finish college so I thought I would give it a try.
12144,Sheldon,How many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?
12145,Leonard,Okay this was helpful.
12146,Leonard,Unbelievable.
12147,Penny,I told you they’ll be right out.
12148,Howard,It’s the least I can do for helping me carry my stuff up.
12149,Leonard,Sheldon Sheldon?
12150,Sheldon,My mother was at bible study. I walked in the house expecting to find it empty and I heard a sound coming from my parents’ bedroom. When I opened the door I saw my father having relations with another woman.
12151,Penny,Uh okay well we were just calling you because we were missing you.
12152,Sheldon,Right. Archimedes once said give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it and I shall move the world.
12153,Howard,You know it. Oo-ah oo-ah.
12154,Sheldon,I don’t need anything at the Galleria. Do you need anything at the Galleria?
12155,Sheldon,366… 367…
12156,Leonard,They’re not going anywhere.  So you’re coming home from work. That’s great. How was work.
12157,Penny,Spaghetti okay?
12158,Penny,Shuddup yeah you do.
12159,Sheldon,Don’t be ridiculous. I have no peers.
12160,Leonard,Yeah bitches are the worst.
12161,Sheldon,Careful you’re using too much Downey. You know if my clothes get too soft it makes me sleepy.
12162,Penny,What about the guy over there in the superhero T-shirt tucked into his sweatpants?
12163,Leonard,So don’t watch TV. Read a book.
12164,Penny,Oh this is the best. You have booze with breakfast on a Tuesday you got a problem. You do it on the weekend you got brunch.
12165,Penny,Mmm.
12167,Leonard,Yeah right here. How was Nebraska?
12168,Leonard,Uh-huh.
12170,Leonard,Oh my God why did you eat it?
12171,Sheldon,Uh what do you say we exchange gifts?
12172,Sheldon,Please try to wear something appropriate. It won’t help my case if the judge is busy trying to read the word Juicy scrawled across your buttocks.
12173,Raj,Did you really have to bring it in with you?
12174,Sheldon,It’s the only explanation I can come up with for why you think you sell shoes and yogurt.
12175,Howard,I give you one simple thing to do contact a complete stranger and make her fall in love with me and you blow it.
12176,Penny,Oh.
12177,Leonard,She said no can we drop it now?
12178,Leonard,Oh we need to kill a couple hours till the next showing of Time Bandits.
12179,Sheldon,Leonard in the world of theoretical physics you never finish. So much is unprovable. But when I was studying that railway guide it was so tangible and so satisfying that something just clicked. Then it clacked. Then it clicked then it clacked click-clack clickety-clack and here we are. Whoo-whoo.
12180,Penny,Well what about this helicopter you control with an iPad?
12181,Howard,Nobody does. I was embarrassed so I didn’t say anything.
12182,Leonard,Howard help me out here.
12183,Sheldon, Penny.
12185,Sheldon,Do you need it to buy a less disturbing sweater-vest?
12186,Sheldon,Oh I see. How about now?
12187,Sheldon,All right let’s get right to the vote. Show of hands all those opposed to Leonard and his reign of tyranny.
12188,Sheldon,Whoa whoa! Now you’re making fun of my bona fides?
12189,Sheldon,Except you identified me your best friend as a gangrenous limb that needed to be severed from the organism and tossed away. The desperate act of a little man with a big Napoleon complex.
12190,Penny,Wow. High-techie-techie. What’s this little box?
12191,Penny,Just guys. Anyway when I told him we split up he was heartbroken and he kept bugging me how’s Leonard? why can’t you get back together with Leonard? I bet Leonard never tipped a cow over on himself. So to get him off my back I told him we worked things out.
12192,Penny,Oh my God this is the best cobbler I’ve ever had.
12193,Sheldon,Hint Madame Curie had her husband to help her.
12194,Raj,Anyway thanks again.
12195,Sheldon,What is it about the word unique you don’t understand?
12196,Howard,Hey you already got a girlfriend. I call dibs.
12197,Penny,Thank you I really appreciate this.
12198,Leonard,So Penny doesn’t want me around her friends I embarrass her. What else could it be?
12199,Sheldon,I’m trying not to attract attention.
12200,Howard,That’s Unbreakable by Khloe and Lamar. And for your information it’s unisex.
12201,Leonard,Where are you going?
12202,Sheldon,Leslie Winkle?
12203,Raj,I broke down and I read Lucy’s blog and in one of the entries she said when we first met I struck her as a little feminine.
12204,Leonard,I don’t think so.
12205,Leonard,For example tonight no-one needs to know that my middle name is Leakey.
12206,Sheldon,I’ll get them.
12207,Sheldon,It’s not bad. Unless you compare it to a train; then it stinks.
12209,Leonard,W-wait!
12210,Leonard,Superman’s gone my stormtrooper’s gone.
12211,Penny,What’s the gist physicist?
12212,Raj,Yeah the theme will be that the greatest love a man can have is the love he has with himself.
12213,Sheldon,Very well. I know you’ve been seeing other men. Have you had coitus with any of them?
12214,Sheldon,In that case may I offer 27 little tweaks to make it slightly less embarrassing?
12215,Leonard,I know. I was looking forward to it.
12216,Penny,Again it was miniature golf.
12217,Leonard,Oh uh Priya’s calling in a few minutes on Skype and we are gonna have a dinner date.
12218,Leonard,I have a couple more quick questions. Do you want to call me from the car?
12219,Howard,I do but for some reason Emily loves it and wants to watch it with me tomorrow so I thought if I start with you first then I could act cool about it with her.
12220,Sheldon,Who’s the bobblehead of?
12221,Sheldon,I hadn’t considered that. Give me a moment. All right I’ve considered it.
12222,Penny,Whenever I saw her she’d say I was too skinny and try and feed me.
12223,Raj,That’s a fair point. We wouldn’t make fun of someone like this to their face.
12224,Sheldon,Yes.
12225,Sheldon,You know I have ten fingers and ten toes. If I tell you a story about each one of them we’ll be here all day let’s just move on.
12226,Raj,Well I believe people do their best work when they feel safe and secure.
12227,Leonard,No I’m not happy.
12228,Sheldon,Oh but then we’d have to baby-proof the apartment. You know my sister has one of those toilet locks in her bathroom. I have two doctorates I still had to go in the sink.
12229,Leonard,Yes.
12230,Penny,Yeah. And there are a few things we need to stay on top of. So we thought it would useful and I can’t believe I’m about to say this um.
12231,Penny,Well it doesn’t matter. We’re not going to the hospital now.
12232,Sheldon,Thank you. They’re my mother’s.
12233,Leonard,Cheeseburger. I get a cheeseburger.
12234,Raj,Can we please stop talking about my testicles? Sheldon tell them what you did.
12235,Sheldon,Hello. Why do I smell methacrylate?
12236,Sheldon,I’ve heard enough. Sit over there.
12237,Raj,Go ahead make jokes. I don’t know why you think you’re going to Comic-Con you just had a baby.
12238,Leonard,Truth what truth? We’re talking about untested hypotheses uh it’s no big deal.
12240,Sheldon,Voyager the space probe or Voyager the Star Trek TV show?
12241,Sheldon,We have people over all the time. We have the maintenance people the pizza delivery man that UPS driver who feels the need to ask how parts of me are hanging.
12242,Raj,Okay so we’ve got um three briskets four meatloafs one lasagna.
12243,Raj,Fine I don’t want to watch with you either. I’ll go over here.
12244,Penny,Hi.
12245,Howard,So?
12246,Sheldon,Amy look I’m on a unicycle!
12247,Howard,No no no I’m fine.
12248,Sheldon,Hit troll with axe. Hit troll with axe. Hit troll with axe. Oh my this is one tough troll.
12249,Howard,Well I need a wingman. I don’t want to come off like a lonely loser.
12250,Raj,No. You take pretty girls underwater in your private submarine and you show them fish. Why does everything have to be dirty with you?
12251,Sheldon,Todd Zarnecki was mean.
12252,Sheldon,All right.
12253,Raj,37 minutes left until the deadline.
12254,Sheldon,Well here’s an interesting turn of events.
12255,Sheldon,I don’t know. Lately we’ve been talking about converting it into a missile silo.
12256,Leonard,Sorry I panicked.
12257,Raj,What? You’re going to make me choose between the woman I love and the money I have very strong feelings for?
12258,Penny,Howard I’ve asked you not to do that.
12259,Leonard,Right now I’m just trying to burp without throwing up.
12260,Penny,Yes.
12261,Leonard,You’d have a better shot with the three-breasted Martian hooker from Total Recall.
12262,Howard,Oh my God you’re back. Oh look at you. You you look like you grew.
12263,Leonard,Hi.
12264,Sheldon,Excuse me. May I have your attention please? I have recently been made aware that my personal relationship with Amy Farrah Fowler has become water cooler gossip. And I just want to say shame on all of you. We’re scientists. Our minds should be focused on the advancement of human knowledge not the intimate details of other people’s lives.
12265,Sheldon,Have you noticed it’s always an A-flat?
12266,Penny,Thank you so much for letting me practice my sales pitch on you. I really appreciate it.
12267,Howard,The kite you made me lose was an authentic Patang an Indian fighting kite that my brother sent to me from New Delhi. It took me a day to put together and two days to paint. This is Hello Kitty.
12268,Leonard,Have you had your appendix out?
12269,Sheldon,No but if you want chicken and get stuck with the fish that’s on you. All right. Oh and lastly please initial here to confirm that ownership of the living room couch is hereby transferred to me in perpetuity all throughout the universe and all alternate universes except for those universes where owning a couch is forbidden by the hive queen. In which case all glory to the hive queen. All right now all that’s left is for us to sign and date the document and we will officially no longer be roommates.
12270,Penny,Come in let’s talk. Do you want a glass of wine?
12271,Raj,Yeah I’m here because I think it’s gonna be like Game of Thrones.
12272,Leonard,Touche.
12273,Leonard,Do you have a cousin Leopold.
12275,Penny,How could you say that?
12276,Leonard,Yeah it’s a regular Manhattan Project. What’s up?
12277,Raj,Can we take a moment to discuss that I just lied to the government for you?
12278,Leonard,No no more toys or action figures or props or replicas or costumes or robots or Darth Vader voice changers I’m getting rid of all of it.
12279,Penny,It’s great isn’t it?
12280,Leonard,Oh okay. I love cheesecake.
12281,Sheldon,Thank you.
12282,Sheldon,Why Penny?
12283,Raj,I wonder what the non-pathetic people are doing tonight.
12284,Penny,Well the last big thing I did was this production of Diary of Anne Frank above a bowling alley. But I think things might be turning around pretty soon.
12285,Howard,You’re in a Beatles cover band and you need Howard to replace your dad as Ringo.
12286,Sheldon,Play through the pain.
12287,Raj,Yeah. Absolutely. It wouldn’t kill you to take a Pilates class with me now and then but you have a certain wiry appeal.
12288,Penny,Wow cool tiger.
12289,Penny,Yeah well next time don’t. Oh and since you like stories so much this is not The Shoemaker
12290,Penny,I kind of figured that.
12291,Sheldon,I’m nervous. I hope people will be around to watch even though it’s Valentine’s Day.
12292,Howard,Well that’s it then we’re doomed.
12293,Leonard,Sheldon you’re being silly.
12294,Howard,You don’t know we’re wrong yet.
12295,Penny,Okay you’re not helping.
12296,Raj,Maybe moving in was a bad idea. I haven’t been here one day I’m already causing problems.
12297,Penny,I don’t know. I’m I’m gonna flirt with him.
12298,Penny,Oh my God! What happened?
12299,Sheldon,Hmm. No not yet.
12300,Raj,Uh actually I’m seeing both of them.
12301,Raj,Though we did ding up the back pretty good with the crib so you might have bought a minivan.
12302,Sheldon,Things have been going really well with the infinite resistance gyroscope.
12303,Leonard,Penny I like all sorts of people. In fact some of my best friends aren’t geniuses.
12305,Sheldon,It’s a game we invented. It’s called Counterfactuals.
12306,Howard,Can we bring anything?
12307,Leonard,On the bright side I don’t think President Siebert will be making us go to any more fund-raisers.
12308,Leonard,I’m the one who thought of Spockumentary.
12309,Sheldon,I don’t care for your mother’s bathroom. There’s not an angle to do one’s business without a clown figurine staring at you.
12310,Sheldon,Or what a joy it is to behold my genitals.
12311,Penny,In school?
12312,Raj,Well maybe there’s a way to appear non-aggressive but also be able to protect ourselves if necessary. Like smiling and waving with one hand but the other hand holding the severed head of a tiger.
12313,Sheldon,Penny you appear to have a package here.
12314,Sheldon,How can I relax? My nervous system is being stretched out like the strings of a harp and plucked by holes and birds and wind and the low-hanging scrotum of the difficult-to-evict Professor Rothman.
12315,Sheldon,Oh that’s clever.
12316,Penny,What what are you doing in our apartment?
12317,Raj,I’ll call 911. What oh no my phone is in my other pants.
12318,Leonard,Great you know there are groceries outside of your apartment?
12319,Raj,What you need is cheat codes motor skills and a magic genie who grants wishes to little boys who suck at Mario Kart.
12320,Howard,Yeah I can relate to being a single parent. I have a dog.
12321,Sheldon,Yes Miss Amy.
12322,Howard,What do you mean not really?
12323,Raj,Oh my God that’s so generous.
12324,Leonard,Oh it was a good one. He played poker with Sir Isaac you don’t care.
12325,Leonard,Additional data. You dog.
12326,Leonard,Yeah we’re really close. Uh uh we’re at the apartment. 
12327,Howard,You were his colleague. How did your research turn out? Great. Hey this is the apartment you get when you win a Nobel.
12328,Sheldon,Oh sorry. That’s not on the list.
12329,Raj,Like when my dog is mad at me she tells me by peeing in my slippers.
12330,Sheldon,What is that?
12331,Raj,Sorry. I I just…
12332,Penny,A lot of lectures?
12333,Leonard,Oh damn it. Can I have a napkin?
12334,Sheldon,President Seibert I don’t know why you’re yelling. You’re the one who made me go on the radio. I was expecting a professional science interview not an attack by some morning zoo shock jock. Well if the university needs money so badly perhaps you should start a swear jar. Whoa that one’s worth a dollar.
12335,Leonard,Take it Raj. It’s more than I’ve ever gotten.
12336,Sheldon,It’s nice to get back to nature. Why don’t I do this more often? What a beautiful forest. Hello little butterfly. What’s your Na-oh!
12337,Sheldon,I’ll say it looks good. It’s in my proprietary font Shelvetica.
12338,Howard,Yeah it’s nice to get dressed up once in a while.
12340,Howard,Rubbish. He’s talking rubbish.
12341,Raj,You know he’s British I’m Indian ever since Gandhi they haven’t liked us very much.
12342,Leonard,Once again I I’m really not much of a dancer.
12343,Leonard,Yes it is Wil.
12344,Sheldon,I don’t follow.
12345,Leonard,Already that was quick.
12346,Howard,Just dandy Mr I-Wish-I-Was-Better-At-Improv.
12347,Leonard,Nothing with quarks.
12348,Sheldon,I opened up and shared something deeply upsetting to me and you treated it as if it were nothing.
12349,Raj,She’s so considerate.
12350,Leonard,Sounds like most of my dates.
12351,Sheldon,Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case and Back to the Future III was get this in the Back to the Future II case.
12352,Penny,I don’t know.
12353,Sheldon,Oh good Lord. Why don’t you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock?
12354,Raj,It is. He stopped trying to find Indian girls for me to marry.
12355,Leonard,Is that your laundry? You only have like six things in there.
12356,Howard,Hey I read that someone invented a way to convert your footsteps into electromagnetic energy so you can charge your cell phone while walking.
12357,Penny,Okay I want in. Ten bucks says I’ll lose interest before that thing stops spinning.
12358,Penny,Well promise you won’t make fun of me.
12359,Howard,Yes.
12360,Sheldon,Get her out of here.
12361,Sheldon,I’m just contemplating Buridan’s donkey.
12362,Howard,I’m not hungry.
12363,Howard,You realize you can’t win.
12364,Penny,Ah.
12365,Raj,Okay then.
12366,Sheldon,I always listen to myself. It’s one of the great joys of my life. Now get your car out of my spot.
12367,Penny,I can explain. I played hooky with the girls then we all went to Disneyland and got… What are you doing?
12368,Howard,What?
12369,Sheldon,Is that your answer or do you not understand the question? We’ll come back to that one.
12370,Sheldon,Hello Leonard.
12371,Leonard,So?
12372,Howard,Go ahead tell my parents why they won’t have any grandchildren.
12373,Leonard,Waah. I don’t want a table.
12374,Sheldon,I’m making friends with this little girl. What’s your name?
12375,Leonard,Yeah real big of you.
12376,Leonard,Yeah. We should do it more often.
12377,Raj,Yeah literally none of it.
12378,Leonard,No.
12379,Sheldon,Wrong. She just took a sip from his Diet Dr. Pepper.
12380,Howard,Anyway if it’s okay with you we should talk about Howard’s bachelor party.
12381,Raj,The lead in The Hunger Games is a woman. Marvel has made Tor a female.
12382,Penny,Sweetie I beat you at this too.
12383,Sheldon,It’s 705.
12384,Leonard,What do you mean? It’s new comic book night.
12385,Sheldon,Of course my grandfather died when I was five. My father died when I was 14.
12386,Leonard,You’re you’re right it feels good.
12387,Raj,You know Amy I don’t even think you and I have had a real conversation. Let’s use tonight to get to know each other a little better. You start.
12388,Sheldon,Yes. I didn’t care for it.
12389,Raj,Uh what number in line are you?
12390,Howard,We have to tell him.
12391,Penny,What’s wrong?
12392,Penny,Okay come on. You know you can do better.
12393,Sheldon,That was different. They were threatened by my intelligence and too stupid to know that’s why they hated me.
12394,Sheldon,The one everyone’s taking this weekend on the party bus.
12395,Raj,Whatever dude. She kissed me.
12396,Howard,Wow.
12397,Sheldon,Interesting. A friendly sentiment in this country cruel taunt in the Sudan. It’s a lesson in context.
12398,Sheldon,Big night? The winter solstice is a big night. It’s over 14 hours in Southern California.
12399,Sheldon,No but maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch.
12400,Sheldon,No I hate them but it gets worse. There it is.
12401,Howard,Whatever. I can see my little princess while I’m at work right?
12402,Sheldon,You’re in trouble.
12403,Sheldon,I guess not.
12404,Leonard,I’m in bed!
12405,Raj,Well we’ll always have the night the heat went out.
12406,Raj,What difference does it make?
12407,Leonard,Oh please don’t do that.
12408,Howard,I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again. Aquaman sucks.
12409,Sheldon,Counting this instance? 317.
12410,Sheldon,Good. I’m glad.
12411,Leonard,Well he came over last night with some pretty good news and we weren’t very supportive.
12412,Sheldon,All I did was answer a few questions about the theory. And then expressed my gratitude that Scientific American doesn’t include any of those smelly perfume cards.
12413,Leonard,You’re giving me a sticker?
12415,Sheldon,More Pad Thai please.
12416,Penny,Seven of clubs! That is amazing!
12417,Raj,Little Lalita. That’s kind of fun to say. Little Lalita Little Lalita Little Lalita you should try it.
12418,Sheldon,One o’clock? I’m not a raccoon.
12419,Sheldon,But I made a video.
12420,Leonard,I don’t care. I don’t have to do anything you say because I don’t think I want to live here anymore.
12421,Penny,Anyway that’s it. I just thought you should know.
12422,Sheldon,She might be contagious. Don’t you think I’m having a rough enough day?
12423,Penny,Well hello? She’s married.
12424,Sheldon,Good morning Your Honour. Dr. Sheldon Cooper appearing in pro se. That is to say representing himself.
12425,Penny,Yeah yeah my mom gave me the same lecture about my virginity. Gotta tell you it was a lot more fun taking it out and playing with it.
12426,Leonard,What about me?
12427,Leonard,Ha-ha.
12428,Penny,Hang on.
12429,Leonard,That’s not your water.
12430,Howard,Phasers on the Borg! Charlie’s Angels.
12431,Leonard,Hey Penny. How was work?
12432,Howard,Hey you totally got that right! E equals M C squared.
12433,Howard,Eh. Although to be fair I watched E.T. build a telephone out of a Speak & Spell and an umbrella. Dude was like a little brown MacGyver.
12434,Raj,I can’t believe Sheldon gave this up.
12435,Penny,Leonard could you pass the soy sauce please?
12436,Penny,Oh yeah sure. Let me just get out my materials. Leonard gave me this briefcase. He used to carry it around in high school. You can still see the dent where they whacked him with it. Okay I would like to talk to you about our new birth control pill Femevra.
12438,Penny,Okay Merry Christmas.
12439,Sheldon,It’s talc. But as that’s a primary ingredient of baby powder I understand your confusion.
12440,Sheldon,String theory is complicated. That’s just yucky. Don’t get any ideas. All right for the sake of argument let’s say that’s true. Why doesn’t Penny just end the relationship?
12441,Sheldon,Look at this. Elon Musk has a theory that we’re all just characters in some advanced civilization’s video game.
12442,Sheldon,Oh good news we ordered lunch so we can all stay here and play Lord of the Rings Risk.
12443,Leonard,Okay I’m going to make this very simple for you. You are not in this relationship I am. Ergo you have no say in anything that happens between me and Stephanie.
12444,Sheldon,Okay new plan. We go to Disneyland play hide and seek on Tom Sawyer’s Island and then come back and see the end of the pitch.
12445,Sheldon,That’s rude.
12446,Penny,Present! Yeah!
12447,Raj,Oh another two hours to go. The wait is killing me.
12448,Leonard,Okay Barry that’s enough.
12449,Raj,As a matter of fact I do. I’m gonna comfort her because I’m a caring and decent friend who’s happy to be there when she needs someone to talk to.
12450,Leonard,And I think it’s nice that you’re taking whatever medication Amy’s clearly giving you.
12452,Sheldon,Okay. Hey I thought you were trying to trick me.
12453,Leonard,You’re really mean you know that?
12454,Penny,Ah.
12455,Leonard,No no no no.
12456,Sheldon,Do you remember the grant proposal I submitted to the National Science Foundation to detect slow-moving monopoles at the magnetic North Pole?
12457,Sheldon,Aw for Pete’s sake. Can we go now?
12458,Leonard,Do you realise that if Penny wakes up there is no reasonable explanation as to why we’re here?
12459,Penny,So why was it his lucky day?
12460,Raj,Really?
12461,Sheldon,You were invited on a quest to the Black Castle?
12462,Sheldon,Oh there well look there’s all kinds of videos.
12463,Raj,What is it?
12464,Leonard,Yeah me too.
12465,Leonard,Did we win? Can we go to bed?
12466,Sheldon,Wait now we don’t know that yet. He isn’t finished. I have a girlfriend and you don’t who?
12467,Sheldon,Ha. The opposite. She’s a neurobiologist and I’m a theoretical physicist. My spirit guides can go suck an egg.
12468,Sheldon,Which way are you going?
12469,Sheldon,Yeah once again I know.
12470,Sheldon,I love strawberry Quik. It’s my favourite pink fluid narrowly beating out Pepto-Bismol.
12471,Howard,Thank you. ‘Cause if she ever found out it would hurt her feelings.
12472,Leonard,You want to prepare him? Install a bladder and a pair of shorts so he can wet himself.
12473,Sheldon,You know the golden rule of line etiquette. No cuts no buts no coconuts.
12474,Raj,Hey Stuart.
12475,Sheldon,I’m sorry. Proceed.
12476,Raj,Actually there’s no proof of that.
12477,Raj,Yes.
12478,Penny,What? A few thousand people listen to you talk about nerd stuff?
12479,Sheldon,Hello.
12480,Howard,Saturday night at the comic book store they’re having a Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah tournament. First prize is five hundred dollars. If we team up we’d be unstoppable.
12481,Sheldon,Don’t thank me. Thank the dice. They told me what percentage of my face to shave.
12482,Sheldon,I wish you weren’t wearing flip-flops. It’s dangerous to drive in flip-flops.
12483,Leonard,We really need a strike here.
12484,Penny,Do you want me to move?
12485,Raj,Hey make sure you tell him that you weren’t home when he came by and that your Indian friend gave you the message the moment you stepped through the door.
12486,Leonard,Hey.
12487,Leonard,Great.
12488,Penny,Uh.
12489,Howard,It’s it’s beautiful.
12490,Sheldon,See that’s funny because…
12491,Leonard,I gotta tell you guys I’m a little worried about Sheldon.
12492,Penny,We could go to a bar.
12493,Penny,You really don’t know why?
12494,Raj,Great what’s your pl… 
12495,Leonard,How about our roof?
12496,Penny,Uh-huh.
12497,Leonard,What brought this on?
12498,Penny,Aw that sounds sweet.
12499,Sheldon,No it doesn’t. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays or there are motion sensors involved.
12500,Leonard,Can I go back and prevent you from explaining that to me?
12501,Leonard,I came home with no pants.
12502,Leonard,Hey.
12503,Raj,Here we go ten and a half hours of apey goodness.
12504,Leonard,Really?
12505,Howard,No thank you Mrs. Wolowitz. As it is I’m going to have to carry my stomach out of here like I’m a fireman rescuing an infant.
12506,Penny,Well if I do well in sales I could end up making a lot more money than you.
12507,Raj,It wouldn’t kill you to pick up the phone.
12508,Howard,And you just let him?
12509,Sheldon,Fine. Leonard made me soup and I was mean to him. Hey I felt a little something. Let me try again. Leonard made me soup and I was mean to him. I was mean to him. He must have felt terrible. Oh now I feel terrible. Neat.
12510,Leonard,So anyway  Hello.
12511,Howard,It’s called Lamaze breathing. It helps you push.
12512,Sheldon,No no now that we’ve cleared the air I wanted to discuss another matter with you.
12513,Penny,It’s not that I want to go I just think it’ll make Leonard happy. And if I have to watch him squeeze into an Ewok costume so be it.
12514,Leonard,Fine.
12515,Howard,You know in India when my baby brother cried like that the servants would just take him far away so we couldn’t hear it. Not always sometimes we’d leave.
12516,Raj,And you’re afraid it’ll do a better job than you?
12517,Leonard,Yeah?
12518,Sheldon,So what’s got you up? Did you have a bad clam?
12519,Raj,I thought we were best friends?
12521,Sheldon,Yeah. Now unfortunately uh my time is much too valuable to waste on nonsense like this so um I’m gonna need you to take it for me. Oh and uh you’d better ace it they’re pretty mad.
12522,Howard,You okay? It’s you. You’re you’re next.
12523,Penny,I know she can be a little intense but I swear she is so sweet once you get past all the…
12524,Penny,You know Sh-Sheldon sometimes it’s nice not knowing what’s coming. I mean look at me and Leonard. We went out we broke up now we’re trying again. We don’t know what’s gonna happen.
12525,Leonard,Sold. “I think it would be better for our relationship if you moved back to your place.” There. It’s done.
12526,Penny,Okay. Never mind.
12527,Penny,Leonard could you pick me up a few comics for my nephew’s birthday?
12528,Leonard,Okay.
12529,Raj,Hello Mummy. Hello Daddy. How are you?
12530,Raj,Would you rather go back to the apartment and deal with Sheldon or have a stranger carve out your corneas with a laser beam?
12532,Raj,Have you heard back from Emily?
12533,Penny,You know your mom’s never been too thrilled with our relationship. Maybe I should get her something so she warms up to me.
12534,Sheldon,Well I try.
12535,Leonard,Yeah.
12536,Raj,Hey guys. Hey Penny. I really appreciate you helping me with this. I don’t know what to do.
12537,Sheldon,No we’re not no we’re not no we’re not.
12538,Sheldon,Excellent excellent. Tire each other out the ring will be mine. Howard why don’t you go after Raj’s mother?
12539,Sheldon,All right pencils down! I have lokh makh and cherrrkh. Anybody got those?
12540,Penny,So it’s okay for you to joke around?
12541,Penny,Another waitress.
12542,Sheldon,No.
12543,Penny,You know Leonard honey I wouldn’t mind if you wanted to go fly kites with Sheldon.
12544,Sheldon,No no. Leonard I’m meant for greater things like unraveling the mysteries of the universe not determining when it’s safe to pass a stopped school bus on a country road.
12545,Sheldon,One of my favourite places to visit is the two-dimensional world described in Edwin Abbott’s mathematical fantasy Flatland.
12546,Sheldon,You were.
12547,Sheldon,Sorry. I just don’t want to be yet another flip-flop fatality.
12548,Leonard,On purpose not the way it used to happen in high school.
12549,Penny,Excuse me.
12550,Leonard,Thank you. I should probably give you a heads up about his mother.
12551,Penny,Oh. What?
12552,Leonard,Not really no.
12553,Leonard,So are you excited to have your own place again?
12554,Sheldon,The resemblance is remarkable. I can practically smell the lotus blossoms woven into your ebony hair.
12555,Sheldon,Oh! There isn’t enough camomile tea in the world to quell the rage in my heart.
12556,Sheldon,Leslie Winkle Penny. She belittles my research.
12557,Penny,How?
12558,Sheldon,Of course you are.
12559,Raj,This is tough but I’m going to say it’s the guy who shows me YouTube videos of people getting hit in the nuts.
12560,Leonard,You’re having people over?
12561,Penny,No I mean we can always go back to being friends.
12562,Raj,He’s gonna be here any second what should we do?
12563,Leonard,Well then what do you want?
12564,Raj,You know if you knocked out this wall it would give you an open floor plan and then it’s a little scary but could be fun indoor fire pit.
12565,Penny,You’re hurting the people around you sweetie.
12566,Howard,Oh don’t bother. I’ll just sleep in Leonard’s room.
12567,Penny,Hey why don’t you just let me find him while you sit there hitting your imaginary brake?
12568,Penny,Well who you gonna hit on? The girl in front of us got strawberry. That’s your favourite.
12569,Sheldon,Okay because that was not clear.
12570,Sheldon,In all of them that is the point.
12571,Leonard,Sorry she made you come over here on a holiday.
12572,Leonard,This is it.  I’ll do the talking.
12573,Penny,Aw thank you.
12574,Sheldon,I’m unhappy.
12575,Raj,Oh man the first monster I see I’m gonna sneak up behind him whip out my wand and shoot my magic all over his ass.
12576,Penny,So who is she?
12577,Sheldon,I believe it’s my turn you may begin your questions whenever you’re ready.
12578,Leonard,Suppose it wouldn’t hurt to get an estimate.
12579,Penny,And in double-blind studies Placinex proved extremely effective in treating all kinds of anxiety. Actually funny story the boys in the lab were worried about getting FDA approval for Placinex. They started taking it stopped worrying.
12580,Sheldon,Emergency preparedness drill.
12581,Leonard,There is no Leo how can you say that?
12582,Sheldon,What?
12583,Penny,Uh maybe the light’s broken.
12584,Leonard,Right the case of who murdered three Saturday nights of my life?
12585,Raj,We can still see something. Uh the new Sandra Bullock movie is playing two blocks away. You know Sandy B always brings it.
12586,Penny,Well there’s this girl I know from back in Nebraska Christie well anyway she called me up and she’s like “Hey how’s California” and I’m like “Awesome” ‘cos you know it’s not Nebraska and the next thing I know she’s invited herself out here to stay with me.
12587,Howard,Oh this is cool. So a few weeks ago I set up a fan page on Facebook for our band and…
12588,Raj,No no. Uh you’ve always wanted to send your food back in a restaurant here’s your chance.
12589,Penny,You just you just walked in and they hired you just like that?
12590,Raj,I’m not an alcoholic.
12591,Raj,She’s scary but it’s a cute scary.
12592,Penny,Oh come on just let him put the app on your phone.
12593,Leonard,Bye.
12594,Penny,To be fair we may have been on edge because of the Christmas tree.
12595,Leonard,I’m going to the office.
12596,Leonard,Hey listen I kind of made plans with the guys this weekend but then I wondered because we’re in this relationship-beta-test if I should have asked you first. Then I thought if I did check with you first you’d think that I was taking things to seriously. And then then I got a nosebleed.
12597,Howard,What’s happening to us? We’re falling apart.
12598,Howard,Actually I’m still here.
12599,Leonard,Significant improvement over the old neighbour.
12600,Leonard,I don’t want to talk about it.
12601,Leonard,Well I’d like that too.
12602,Leonard,I’m still going to go with you.
12603,Raj,I’m okay.
12604,Penny,Oh got it. Thank you for educating me.
12605,Sheldon,Gentlemen I think we are losing sight of the real issue. We are on the precipice of becoming faceless cogs in the military-industrial complex. Isn’t that exciting?
12606,Raj,Okay I’ll tell you but please don’t judge me. He pays for my car my rent and my credit cards.
12607,Sheldon,You might as well just wait at the airport for your flight.
12608,Sheldon,You guys stink.
12609,Sheldon,Renaissance fair? More of a medieval slash age of enlightenment slash any excuse to wear a codpiece fair.
12610,Leonard,I totally had sex in the ocean.
12611,Raj,I can’t stop thinking about it.
12612,Sheldon,Wait a minute I’d want to see that too.
12613,Sheldon,Of course I understand. And who are you to tell me about outer space?
12614,Penny,Yeah once I was too lazy to walk across the hall so I used your toothbrush.
12615,Raj,Blowing the gates. Control shift B! Oh my God so many goblins!
12616,Sheldon,So uh what do you say?
12617,Howard,Yeah nothing’s been changed since he drove it.
12618,Sheldon,Is it true as a child you were a stutterer and were functionally mute for eight years?
12619,Raj,What? I thought we were all… never mind.
12620,Penny,Uh why don’t you come with me. I’ll walk you to the apartment.
12621,Leonard,Before I answer may I just say your skin has never looked better.
12622,Sheldon,Penny Penny Penny. Everything you’re saying is true but please allow me to continue. Raj you’re out. The good question while you do provide a certain cultural diversity to an otherwise homogenous group your responses to the questionnaire were truly disturbing. How could you for a moment think that my favourite amino acid is Glutamine?
12623,Leonard,How about when you put GPS trackers in your garbage because you were convinced North Korean spies were stealing your doodles? The chicken nuggets you were sure were human nuggets. The strangely-shaped cloud that was following you around town. The time you put on my shirt by mistake and were convinced you’d started growing again.
12624,Sheldon,Ah the spoils. I see why victors love them.
12625,Raj,Yeah.
12626,Howard,Oh well I’m sure they wouldn’t have tasted nearly as good if I hadn’t tried your food first.
12627,Penny,Sheldon wait! Will you?
12629,Sheldon,And Amy you told me you were sick but you look just as pale and tired as always.
12630,Howard,What you don’t like wind chimes?
12631,Penny,Fine.
12632,Penny,Oh we don’t need to talk about that anymore. Leonard covered it pretty well in the car.
12633,Penny,Get out.
12634,Penny,Mm. You know Amy sometimes when you’re in a relationship with someone you really care about the sucky part is it leaves you open to getting hurt.
12635,Sheldon,Just to be clear do I have to stop saying coitus with everyone or just you?
12636,Raj,Okay I think I see what’s happening here. You’re jealous of me.
12637,Leonard,Glasses? I really don’t think that’s gonna change… oh my God you look so smart and hot.
12638,Sheldon,No that measuring cup has always been for urine.
12639,Leonard,What do you mean why? It’s Valentine’s Day.
12640,Leonard,Uh before you open that um are you familiar with the story of The Shoemaker and the Elves?
12641,Leonard,You’re in your bedroom.
12642,Leonard,I deliberately tried to sabotage Stuart’s date with Penny.
12643,Sheldon,Oh but I like this computer.
12645,Raj,You’re not wrong about Fruit Stripe. I was always a Hubba Bubba man.
12646,Howard,What the hell is this?
12647,Leonard,Can you or can’t you?
12648,Leonard,Smooth. Hi.
12649,Penny,Oh God I feel terrible.
12650,Leonard,So just take your time and concentrate.
12651,Sheldon,There was a scientist who had a theory and James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o. J-A-M-E-S C-L-E-R-K space M-A-X-W-E-L-L And James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o. There was a scientist who had a theory and James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o A-M-E-S…
12652,Sheldon,Oh that’s clever. Let me see if I understand this correctly. Her missing you is an emotional state you find desirable?
12653,Sheldon,Apologize.
12654,Sheldon,And I’m sure your parents are proud. Now finally the line in this room the thing you’ll see was an obvious reference to Fantastic Four member The Thing who’s made entirely of…
12655,Raj,I believe you two have prepared vows?
12656,Penny,Sorry. I was waiting for the bazinga.
12657,Penny,Sorry.  Holy crap on a cracker.
12658,Penny,Oh that’s so sweet. I mean look at you you are gorgeous.
12659,Howard,I can’t believe you kissed my sister with moth mouth.
12660,Sheldon,All right we’re about to go live everyone on their A-game good energy. Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
12661,Leonard,Uh so Ramona tell us about yourself. Do you do you have a boyfriend?
12662,Penny,Okay. Uh no the shipment has not arrived and I really need those shoes. They are my biggest seller. Yes ladies sizes six through ten. Thank you. Oh sorry I have to go I have a customer. Bye-bye. Hi. Can I help you?
12663,Leonard,No if it’s not a fact it’s not a fact.
12665,Leonard,That’s not why we’re here.
12666,Sheldon,I thought I just did.
12667,Penny,Just shut up.
12668,Sheldon,Aw you always know just what to say after I tell you what to say.
12669,Leonard,Maybe they fell in love with him as a puppy and didn’t know how big he was gonna be.
12670,Sheldon,But I apologized. And that was hard for me because I didn’t do anything wrong.
12671,Leonard,Saloons?
12672,Leonard,Sheldon I wasn’t done talking. She hands in the paper tomorrow. I know I could help her. And she’s my girlfriend. I I should be allowed to help her. Why aren’t I allowed to help her?
12673,Sheldon,Oh great. Raj why don’t you and Howard go get the charcoal? Leonard why don’t you start working on some preliminary Web site designs. I’ll make some space in our apartment so we can move the manufacturing process.
12674,Penny,All right keep thinking.
12675,Raj,Do you know what he did. He watched me work for ten minutes and then started to design a simple piece of software that could replace me.
12676,Sheldon,Good. Because I am too hot and tired to go on about how much I hate Voyager the TV show.
12677,Sheldon,Boy you chase one balloon for three miles.
12678,Sheldon,Why? It clearly doesn’t work.
12679,Penny,On what?
12680,Leonard,Got a bit of traffic this morning huh? Think it’s gonna rain? Instead of underpants I covered my crotch with potato salad this morning. Thoughts? Okay I know what’ll cheer you up let’s play one of your driving games.
12681,Sheldon,No Dr. Feynman. If I solve it for you you’ll never learn.
12682,Sheldon,Sorry? I’ve been dreaming about going to the Large Hadron Collider since I was nine years old.
12683,Penny,Oh that’s right. Nachos and a turkey club.
12684,Sheldon,Well A comic books employ storytelling through sequential art a medium that dates back 17000 years to the cave paintings of Lascaux and B you play the harp. Like that’s cool.
12685,Penny,I don’t know. I mean what have women said to you when they wanted to slow a relationship down?
12686,Leonard,Will you stay out of this?
12687,Sheldon,I’m not too proud to admit that I cried myself to sleep.
12689,Leonard,You don’t know your own husband’s birthday.
12690,Leonard,They’re not going on the trip.
12692,Penny,Um well um all right. You you know how in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Ron didn’t abandon Harry just because Harry started dating Ron’s sister?
12693,Leonard,If there was a hidden compartment don’t you think you’d be stuffed in it by now?
12694,Leonard,No I got you something for Valentine’s Day and I was too embarrassed to give it to you.
12695,Leonard,Yeah.
12696,Penny,You know Amy when we say girl talk it doesn’t just have to be about our lady parts.
12697,Penny,The end.
12698,Penny,Yes! Sorry tell me about Professor Proton.
12699,Sheldon,These are hydration backpacks. For efficiency whenever I’m thirsty I have access to water. When I’m hungry I have lentil soup.
12700,Raj,Yes.
12701,Sheldon,Now?
12702,Howard,How dare you ambush my girlfriend at the gym!
12703,Sheldon,Oh smashing. Now Leonard do you know how to get there?
12704,Leonard,Really? Great.
12705,Leonard,Yeah. So?
12706,Leonard,So are we ever gonna hang out with this girl?
12707,Howard,More importantly you’ve a Darth Vader voice changer?
12708,Raj,Can I bring girls here?
12709,Howard,Hey just because a man shows caring for another man doesn’t mean he’s displaying the love that dare not speak its name. Did she definitely say she didn’t want kids?
12710,Leonard,No Sheldon there’s not going to be a scene. There’s two of us and one of him.
12711,Howard,Mm Disneyland? I don’t know. With all the crowds and the weird characters walking around just reminds me too much of India.
12713,Sheldon,Wow and I remember when you loved playing games with me. Maybe Penny isn’t the only relationship you’re phoning in.
12714,Penny,Look just find out what’s up with this trip to India.
12715,Sheldon,You really? You can assess the quality of my work? Okay um here. I wrote this when I was five years old.
12716,Penny,I am taking you shopping.
12717,Howard,Great. Where would you like to go?
12719,Sheldon,I’m sneaking into work. Now if the guard at the university asks what’s under the blanket you tell him it’s some lobster traps.
12721,Leonard,No it’s not crazy it’s uh uh it’s a paradox. And paradoxes are part of nature think about light. Now if you look at Huygens light is a wave as confirmed by the double slit experiments but then along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too. Well I didn’t make it worse.
12722,Penny,What is it?
12723,Penny,I don’t know. ‘Cause it’s Christmas?
12724,Howard,In case you didn’t follow that I’m the coffee.
12725,Penny,You sure that’s your choice? ‘Cause I’ve had that dinner.
12726,Sheldon,Aren’t you going to check your messages?
12727,Howard,Come on Daddy. All the other scientists have seat warmers. This is so humiliating. I’ve got to get tenure. Okay let’s meet halfway. How about I cut my cleaning lady down to twice a week? Looks like we’re both going to be living like animals.
12728,Raj,I’ve never seen it.
12729,Sheldon,Uh a combination of the moon’s solar reflection and the energy storage capacity of Kryptonian skin cells.
12730,Leonard,Yeah I do.
12731,Penny,Really? Want to go to Hawaii?
12732,Leonard,Penny’s taking you to the DMV I’m going to bed.
12733,Sheldon,Amy I have gotten more done in the last few days than I have since I made the switch to dark matter. What if I stop doing this and it all goes away?
12734,Leonard,Thank you.
12735,Raj,I need a hug.
12736,Raj,What is it papa.
12737,Leonard,Excuse me while I go tell Missy the good news. 
12738,Leonard,Of course we can split any profits three ways.
12739,Sheldon,Do you even think about other people Leonard? Do you?
12740,Penny,Yes.
12741,Sheldon,Dear Crazy Future Sheldon this is a thermostat. It controls the temperature of the apartment. The ideal setting is 72 degrees. If you find this too cold then put on a jacket. A straitjacket ’cause 72’s the best and you’re crazy. Now this is your spot. You’re very protective of it. When anyone else tries to sit here you berate them relentlessly. It sounds mean but somehow you make it adorable. People are also delighted by your love of pranks. For example Leonard has no idea what I did to his coffee. It wasn’t replace it with Folger’s crystals I’ll tell you that much.
12742,Sheldon,You need to go to the back of the line.
12743,Howard,You have a desk.
12744,Sheldon,Okay.
12745,Raj,Thank you.
12746,Raj,I thought you were a badass.
12747,Leonard,Howard I’m sorry… we’re… we’re
12748,Howard,Should have put it in the bag first.
12749,Sheldon,It’s very simple. This is A  this is C…
12750,Howard,Does she really mean that or was she signing it sarcastically?
12751,Sheldon,Oh I like their emergency room. Yeah even if it turns out you don’t have Dengue fever they still let you take a lollipop.
12752,Raj,Hi.
12753,Leonard,You know what? It’s probably fine.
12754,Sheldon,Oh I’ve been meaning to tell you I figured out your magic trick.
12755,Leonard,Come on you need a four person team we’re four people.
12756,Sheldon,Well I don’t think you have a shot there. I have noticed that Lesley Winkle recently started shaving her legs. Now given that winter is coming one can only assume that she is signalling sexual availability.
12757,Raj,Do you like living with her?
12758,Sheldon,Yes.
12759,Sheldon,Hang on. Based on the number of chirps per minute and the ambient temperature in this room it is a snowy tree cricket.
12760,Leonard,What do you want?
12761,Raj,Oh okay. Got it.
12762,Leonard,It really is.
12763,Penny,It’s like scrolling through the emojis on my phone.
12764,Raj,Shall we toast?
12765,Sheldon,Leonard I would like us to stop fighting about our possessions.
12766,Leonard,Yeah.
12767,Leonard,Well you know I just noticed I haven’t really met any of them.
12768,Leonard,Hey Leslie.
12769,Leonard,You’re making her uncomfortable.
12770,Howard,You’re right. I… I am talking to you. Hello Penny how are you?
12771,Leonard,Yeah I I thought you guys might hit it off.
12772,Penny,Yeah.
12773,Raj,I’m all out.
12774,Raj,What now?
12775,Howard,I will. You can download my paper on the Van Allen Belts from the university server as well.
12776,Raj,We’re on a quest through the Valley of Fire to acquire the sacred crown.
12777,Sheldon,That’s the best part you don’t have to see I told Penny that you would be embarrassed if you knew that she found out that you had lied so she’s agreed to operate as if the original lie was still in force.
12778,Sheldon,One moment. I’m conducting an experiment.
12779,Raj,Too bad ’cause she was checking you out before.
12780,Leonard,Really?
12781,Penny,That’s easy for you to say. You weren’t just called a b-b-b-b-bitch.
12782,Howard,I must be strong so I don’t stray from my true purpose the study of the universe.
12783,Sheldon,Zip it pip it. Can I have your phone number?
12784,Sheldon,I can’t send it back I had it engraved. Here lie the ashes of Leonard Hofstadter. He thought he was right but his room mate knew better.”
12785,Penny,No they’re not.
12786,Raj,Whatever.
12787,Raj,Will you come visit me in India?
12788,Sheldon,This appears significantly more monolithic than it did on my laptop. No one expects to see Hominids learning to use bones as weapeons.
12789,Leonard,Well he doesn’t live at Walmart but he still threw a tantrum when he saw Marshmallow Peeps after Easter. And that’s the same man who complains you can’t find Marshmallow Peeps after Easter.
12790,Penny,Okay you know what if I’m not allowed to be snide you’re not allowed to be condescending.
12791,Penny,Amy little vixen. Just working it under all those layers of wool and polyester.
12792,Howard,Well I’m glad to see you moving forward.
12793,Leonard,So go.
12794,Penny,You know one night Leonard’s nose whistled so loud I swear it was like sleeping on a train track.
12795,Leonard,Uh yeah.
12796,Penny,You know for a smart guy you really seem to have a hard time grasping the concept don’t piss off the people who handle the things you eat.
12797,Penny,For me the worst part was when people saw us leave with them.
12798,Raj,Oh please show me a ten-year-old who knows to dip Tootsie Rolls in Nutella.
12799,Howard,Of course. I’ll give you guys some space. Let me just get this out of your way.
12800,Penny,You’re talking about the painting right?
12801,Penny,We have been monitoring your son Sheldon from the 23rd Century and we have determined that he is now ready to join us. His unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy.
12802,Raj,Why did Howard leave you in the middle of the road anyway?
12803,Raj,Yes so I was just warming up some milk for Halley and I thought it smelled a little funky so I checked the date that you wrote on the bottle and it says Flerbsday.
12804,Howard,My name is Howard. I can make your hair into diamonds. My mom is morbidly obese. Everybody love me.
12805,Sheldon,Your doom!
12806,Howard,Oh we could set it up like a scavenger hunt where the last puzzle gives the winner Sheldon’s contact information.
12807,Sheldon,No. Now that you know my weakness I hate you more than ever.
12808,Leonard,Hey.
12809,Leonard,She seems nice.
12810,Sheldon, Leonard and Penny.
12811,Leonard,Well flush Sheldon down the toilet and get me a new one.
12812,Sheldon,Oh. Is it true they used scuba gear to create the sound of Darth Vader breathing?
12813,Howard,Ooh maybe we could come up with a business plan to compete with this place.
12814,Leonard,Bye.
12815,Leonard,You know what you don’t have to give me this. You keep it.
12816,Sheldon,Run an infra-red repeater photocell here emitter here easy peasy.
12817,Raj,We’re being ridiculous. There’s no way a woman that attractive is trying to seduce Sheldon Cooper.
12818,Penny,Really? You couldn’t just say that? You had to tell the scrotum story?
12819,Leonard,Hey guys.
12820,Penny,That’s like in 45 minutes.
12821,Howard,I don’t want you to pretend to be me. You can be like my uh online wingman. Like if we met her at a bar and you talked me up.
12822,Leonard,Mm-hmm.
12823,Raj,I appreciate the apology but it’s really not necessary. I overstepped my bounds.
12824,Raj,Wow that’s amazing.
12825,Leonard,He’s the man of his family you have to respect his wishes.
12826,Penny,Is it? Oh. It’s like his sinuses are right here in the car.
12827,Sheldon,It’s called fitting in. By the way good luck.
12828,Leonard,Don’t you think that’s something you should have figured out before you stomped over here?
12829,Howard,What? No.
12830,Sheldon,Yeah. Did you know that while Leonard is not considered a tall fellow in our country in today’s North Korea he’s downright average. Hey talk about a keeper.
12831,Sheldon,Hello Penny. I just stopped by to bring you this gift.
12832,Sheldon,Is the decision to not discuss it open for discussion?
12833,Sheldon,So what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?
12834,Leonard,Sorry.
12835,Leonard,I don’t know
12836,Leonard,Hi Howard. Howard?
12837,Sheldon,Thank you for your services gentlemen. Now I’m hoping to broaden our audience with your youthful rock and roll music.
12838,Leonard,Like what?
12839,Penny,Yeah. And I said if it wasn’t epistemic we might as well not do it.
12840,Leonard,It’s harder than I thought.
12841,Leonard,Nothing.
12843,Penny,I don’t know. He said he’s ready.
12844,Penny,I don’t get it.
12845,Leonard,The hope has been that you’d eventually bend to public opinion. So Priya what brings you back to LA?
12846,Penny,No I think I’m just going to stay in tonight and do laundry. 
12847,Leonard,The bodysnatchers clause requires me to help you destroy someone we know who’s been replaced with an alien pod.
12848,Penny,Well thank you. You’re a good friend and you changed my life.
12850,Leonard,Fine. I’m not sure you should have quit. But if you care so much what I think why didn’t you ask me before you did it?
12851,Leonard,It’s not hard. Just picture the Three Stooges and then take away two stooges.
12852,Raj,May I present live from New Delhi Dr and Mrs V. M. Koothrappali.
12853,Howard,Stop!
12854,Penny,I’m sorry I was thinking about work.
12855,Leonard,Wait I don’t think it’s Shatner.
12856,Sheldon,Because there’s only one of me I’m more valuable.
12857,Leonard,Six thousand four hundred and twenty seven dollars. Forty seven dollars once my nana’s birthday check gets here.
12858,Sheldon,I didn’t notice.
12859,Sheldon,Well the important thing is I said that big sandwich would ruin everything and I was right.
12860,Sheldon,Yes.
12861,Leonard,Here.
12862,Penny,No don’t do that. No reason to be mean to her.
12863,Leonard,Oh it’s okay.
12864,Howard,And Amy you need to be patient with Sheldon instead of pressuring him to accept intimacy on your terms.
12865,Sheldon,Oh now we can’t let him lose money Leonard. I’m so sorry.
12866,Raj,Actually how do you feel about watching House of 1000 Corpses?
12867,Sheldon,Okay. Wait hang on. Bladder check. We’re good to go.
12868,Leonard,Gee I don’t know. Maybe it’s because I was always the subject of her little experiments. Did you get to the chapter where she staged the Easter egg hunt with no eggs to see how long I’d keep looking? The answer by the way June.
12869,Raj,Hold on. Isn’t there something else you wanted to tell him?
12870,Leonard,So these are for you and if you’re not too mad we’d love to take you guys to dinner.
12871,Penny,Oh boy it is crazy in here tonight huh Glen?
12872,Raj,Call you right back.
12873,Leonard,Let’s go. We’re going to miss the coming attractions.
12874,Howard,Nothing I was just hoping for something a little more you know redonkulous.
12875,Sheldon,Ah a combination of all your names. Very clever. I assume Koothranardowitz was taken?
12876,Leonard,Oh I’ll probably say yes.
12877,Sheldon,I’ve done it! I’ve won! The ring is mine! It’s mine!  Where’s the ring?
12878,Sheldon,I’m sorry. I misspoke. What I meant to say was my battery died.
12879,Penny,Honey if you want one just get one.
12880,Sheldon,The list extends outside of science. Painters like Van Gogh and Pollock chess champion Bobby Fischer Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys.  I remember the song. It’s called Darlin’ by the Beach Boys. Oh thank goodness. I’m not crazy. I don’t have to take a pigeon as my bride.
12881,Sheldon,Make yourself comfortable.  Sheldor is back online.
12882,Penny,That’s Superman’s big ice thing right?
12883,Penny,Leslie.
12884,Sheldon,Hmm yes you did. Now to review the following provisions are hereby activated. In the refrigerator as opposed to us having two separate shelves and one communal shelf the three of us now get individual shelves and the door becomes communal. Next apartment vacuuming shall be increased from two to three times a week to accommodate the increased accumulation of dead skin cells. Thirdthe bathroom schedule. Now I’m given to understand women have different needs so we’ll have to discuss that.
12885,Sheldon,Good idea. We’ll go to Corleone’s.
12886,Penny,Again read the book we gave you.
12887,Penny,Of course it is it’s been in the news. And it’s a very famous boson.
12888,Howard,The doorman said this is the right building.
12889,Sheldon,Right a ball of hot flaming gas that collapses in on itself. 
12890,Sheldon,Yeah we need to stop for magnets on the way home this is going right on the fridge.
12891,Leonard,Oh I’m so sure I’m going to regret this but who was I with?
12892,Leonard,Aw man did you see this post from Raj?
12893,Leonard,Listen I don’t know if I can go on the expedition.
12894,Leonard,Raj come on. You fall in love with any girl who smiles at you. A month ago you were writing poems about his fiancee.
12895,Leonard,What?
12896,Howard,What? What about the mission? You said we were a real-life landing party.
12897,Sheldon,As per your suggestion we’re hanging out. Quite frankly I don’t see what all the hoopla’s about. Go on Amy.
12898,Sheldon,Well then I’m all out of guesses. What? Me move across the hall. Why would you even suggest such a thing?
12899,Sheldon,I said Leonard you said no.
12902,Raj,Oh don’t bother. I’ll just sleep in Leonard’s room.
12903,Sheldon,Nice try. Now in 1964 Dr. Peter Higgs accomplished self-promoter and physicist he wrote a paper postulating the existence of a subatomic particle called the Higgs boson. Now initially the paper was rejected but recently he was proven right and now he’s on the fast track to win a Nobel prize.
12904,Penny,Oh thank you.
12905,Howard,Ask why not again I’ve got an answer.
12906,Leonard,Not a problem. I grew up with a mother who emasculated my father financially and in every other aspect of his life so really it’s what I think love looks like.
12907,Sheldon,Good idea I need my wrist brace all this button pushing is aggravating my old Nintendo injury.
12908,Penny,Bored. Okay. These are Steve Maddens. These are Nine West. These are Target. Oh but don’t they look like Chanel? These are Michael Kors. These are Roxy. These are Sachel’s. Oh these are Betsy Johnson they’re so cute…
12909,Sheldon,Howard I’m going to need another Mandarin lesson. I obviously didn’t make my point with those people.
12910,Howard,I am. And now I’m crying for a whole different reason!
12911,Sheldon,It was a harmless Halloween prank. Look.
12912,Howard,If she gave you any look at l. It was a you suck look.
12913,Howard,On the bright side she didn’t even notice the pill. Why does Emily like this stuff? Do you think there’s something psychologically wrong with her?
12914,Penny,What if I ask Sheldon you just happen to be in the room?
12915,Sheldon,Stop that.
12916,Leonard,All right Amy there’s one ogre left. Take him out.
12917,Penny,Yes. I’m a pharmaceutical sales rep.
12918,Howard,Wait where are you going? We were doing so well. She never even got to see my penis. Ta-da!
12919,Leonard,Yeah that sounds fun.
12920,Sheldon,All right my turn. Mm. Oh I know. Never have I ever kept a secret bank account because I think my wife can’t handle money. Did I win? I feel like I won.
12921,Penny,Guys I think I need to go to the emergency room.
12922,Penny,Oh no are all the machines taken? What are you gonna do?
12923,Sheldon,You violated the sanctity of my mouth.
12924,Sheldon,Thank you. Ira if I may I’d like to apologize for my behaviour last week.
12925,Penny,Uh sweetie are you all right?
12926,Leonard,My point is while you’re spending all this time on your own building computers or practicing your cello what you’re really doing is becoming interesting. And when people finally do notice you they’re gonna find someone a lot cooler than they thought. And for those of you who were popular in high school it’s over sorry. Thank you and congratulations.
12927,Sheldon,Wouldn’t have been any ass-kickings if that stupid death ray had worked.
12928,Leonard,Is the autumn cruel for letting the flowers die or is that just nature’s way?
12929,Sheldon,– What’s wrong with it?
12930,Leonard,I would pull this car over and kick you out but If Penny dumps me you’re all I got.
12931,Penny,Oh no.
12932,Howard,I don’t mean to burst your bubble dude but those penile enlargement pills do not work.
12934,Leonard,Thank you officer.
12935,Penny,I’m going over to Mike’s. Leonard thank you so much.
12936,Raj,Really? Ask her how many children she wants and whatever number she says say me too.
12937,Leonard,Excuse me.
12938,Penny,You know the only way I could explain it would be in a therapist’s office with dolls.
12940,Leonard,You want to know what I think? I think the idea that someone could be as smart as you or even smarter scares the pants off you and you can’t deal with it.
12941,Sheldon,There there.  Would you prefer to wait in our apartment?
12942,Sheldon,Because I knew you’d screw this up.
12943,Raj,No. You have to read it how Dr. Angus McDougal of the University of Edinburgh would. This wee li’l bairn of a theory nearly blew me kilt off.
12944,Penny,It’s like the happiness won’t ever leave the apartment.
12945,Howard,Cocktain shrimp are $12.50.
12946,Raj,What?
12947,Sheldon,Semiotics. The study of signs and symbols it’s a branch of philosophy related to linguistics.
12948,Leonard,It’s true I did. I did say that. When we were at the used bookstore together and I saw the first edition and I bought it.
12949,Raj,How is that a T?
12950,Sheldon,Who haven’t learned their place yet.
12951,Sheldon,Hey if you didn’t know Bruce Willis was dead the whole time that’s not on me. Okay. Here it comes. You tried to take care of me when I was sick and I was mean to you. There’s no excuse for that. And I’m truly sorry.
12952,Howard,What you need is cheat codes motor skills and a magic genie who grants wishes to little boys who suck at Mario Kart.
12953,Leonard,I was unstoppable. I mean I was I was on fire. It was like my mind and my body were totally connected like like athletes must feel when they’re in the zone.
12954,Leonard,And how could a chimp even solve that? That was impossible.
12955,Leonard,Do you want liquid helium or not?
12956,Howard,Hey here comes Stuart and his date.
12957,Penny,Had a great time ciao 
12958,Sheldon,Based on the number of awkward encounters I’ve had with strange men leaving her apartment in the morning plus the number of times she’s returned home wearing the same clothes she wore the night before…
12959,Raj,And does Sheldon know you’re dating Sheldon?
12960,Leonard,Aw.
12961,Leonard,Yeah she’s definitely going after Sheldon.
12962,Penny,You actually smell the wine?
12963,Sheldon,You may need this more than I do.
12964,Leonard,Uh sure. Why?
12965,Sheldon,Oh. Never have I ever pushed all the buttons in an elevator.
12966,Sheldon,There’s a lot of harm in trying something new. That’s why we test out drugs and cosmetics on bunny rabbits.
12967,Penny,Does the study say what happens to the unpopular kids?
12968,Leonard,Damn right I’m angry with my mother. For God’s sake I was eight years old. She humiliated me. That’s when the bed-wetting started again.
12969,Leonard,Maybe I heard you wrong. A lot of words sound like yoga.
12970,Sheldon,If we were an old married couple the wife would serve iced tea and snickerdoodles.
12971,Sheldon,I did but I think I’ve kind of outgrown Star Trek. You know stock characters ludicrous plots beam me up. What a load of hooey.
12972,Raj,That’s okay. A complaint has been filed. So that’s it. That was my last hope. I’m going to be deported sent home in disgrace exposed to the sardonic barbs of my cousin Sanjay. Or as you may know him Dave from AT&T customer service.
12973,Leonard,Well I don’t think you called it idiotic.
12974,Sheldon,Oh no no I’m just here to get my hair cut.
12975,Raj,We could eat after the movie.
12976,Leonard,It’s good that we got out and did something physical.
12977,Raj,Then how?
12978,Raj,Fine then I guess it’s two against two. How do we decide?
12979,Sheldon,All right I’ve taken the liberty of drafting these workflow charts which outline our various duties and the path we will follow as we develop our ground-breaking new app.
12980,Leonard,Hey.
12981,Penny,Sheldon you’re up.
12982,Sheldon,There’s a cucumber in my water.
12983,Sheldon,Family or friend?
12984,Sheldon,Thank you. Uh the university made me come here. I didn’t want to. Uh big fan of the show.
12985,Penny,I slept all day?
12987,Penny,Oh they’re not my friends.
12988,Sheldon,Oh thank you. Here get yourself an eraser for your troubles.
12989,Sheldon,For science.
12990,Leonard,Whoa!
12991,Leonard,Uh no thank you.
12992,Leonard,Sheldon think this through you’re going to ask Howard to choose between sex and Halo.
12993,Sheldon,In case either of you have larceny in your heart you should know that I’ve moved my money out of the snake can.
12994,Sheldon,Huh. All right do it. Tell him we’re in.
12995,Penny,I assume we’re still talking about the movies but after today who knows.
12996,Leonard,Yeah yeah that’s the fun part. We’re also getting new curtains for my bedroom and a dust ruffle and a duvet and I don’t even know what a duvet is but I’m pretty sure if I did I wouldn’t want one but every time I talk to her about moving out she cries and we have sex.
12997,Sheldon,I’m not ignoring my sister. I’m ignoring all of you.
12998,Leonard,Well technically this would be an alpha test. A beta test requires people that weren’t involved in the development of the appli…
12999,Leonard,Are you insane? I’m not going to prostitute myself just so we can get some new equipment.
13000,Penny,Of course he is. Look that girl just got dumped by her boyfriend. She’s angry she’s drunk and her favorite movie is Slumdog Millionaire. I mean.
13001,Howard,Forget the mission how did that little yutz get a girl on his own?
13002,Sheldon,He does that all the time doesn’t he? 15.
13003,Leonard,What do you think?
13004,Sheldon,Then as a mental exercise I invite you to figure out why the two of us can’t play three-person chess. Can you believe this guy? Social protocol does however require me to bring you a hot beverage in your time of need.
13005,Leonard,Great. Tonight he wants to look at ladders at Home Depot.
13006,Leonard,Oh come on why would you do that?
13007,Leonard,She’s been here before.
13008,Howard,Okay that’s my life that’s my friends good to see you say goodbye.
13009,Leonard,You still are. Uh Mom hey tell Mary the story about how I made a Van der Graaf generator out of our vacuum cleaner.
13010,Howard,They know that we’re not exclusive and we just don’t ask too many questions.
13011,Sheldon,See?
13012,Howard,Have you seen this Archie comic? It’s actually Archie versus Predator.
13013,Sheldon,Wait hold on hold on. How do we know that you’re not gonna take the money and drive away?
13014,Leonard,I know.
13015,Leonard,I thought we were getting breakfast before work.
13016,Raj,Don’t worry Jerry won’t be fooled by that type of behaviour.
13017,Howard,I said no questions.
13018,Sheldon,And yet you get to weigh in. Democracy it’s pretty cool isn’t it?
13019,Leonard,Uh you’re a naughty girl. And and uh I I want to punish you with my love?
13020,Sheldon,How so?
13021,Leonard,I’m sure I would. But why why exactly?
13022,Howard,Not so loud but ideally yes. Thanks.
13023,Sheldon,That was not fifteenth century soap my God those people need to learn you can’t just put “ye olde” in front of anything and expect to get away with it.
13024,Howard,So as Hannah Montana Miley was a world-famous pop star. But then she would take off her wig and go to school like a normal girl. Which I don’t have to tell you at that age is its own headache.
13025,Leonard,What?
13026,Sheldon,Peas! Perfect they can be electrons.
13027,Sheldon,While you watch me do it.
13028,Sheldon,Yeah well I understand that I’m half naked but there is a reasonable explanation. While I slept in my sleeper car all my possessions were stolen. Now typically I wear pyjamas but I recently adopted a hobo lifestyle and pyjamas are the sleep-pants of the Man. I’ll have you know Mahatma Gandhi wore no pants and a nation rallied behind him. My good man now before you walk away I know that I may appear deranged but I am in fact a world-renowned physicist. Ask me the difference between a boson and a fermion. Go ahead ask. Bosons have integer spin fermions have half-integer spin. My legs are getting cold. Why won’t anybody help me?
13029,Sheldon,Penny.
13030,Sheldon,Oh do we have to suffer through this transparently manipulative pseudo-reality again?
13031,Leonard,Great. I’ll go get my stuff.
13032,Sheldon,Very well.
13033,Howard,Do it.
13034,Leonard,Oh me.
13035,Leonard,Come on.
13036,Leonard,I bet you’re right.
13037,Penny,Okay look would it make you feel better if I did something dumb like sneak out of work one day to go audition for a Kevin Smith movie?
13038,Penny,What?
13039,Sheldon,Interesting. The acquaintance is the first to greet me.
13040,Penny,Well you’re talking to us now. I mean you don’t seem nervous.
13042,Leonard,We might be starting to zero in on your problem.
13043,Sheldon,And now it’s time for the speed round of Flag or Not a Flag.
13044,Penny,Yeah I’m gonna call Bernadette and see what’s keeping them.
13045,Leonard,I know. Did you see they still have a video rental place? it’s like Colonial Williamsburg.
13046,Sheldon,And you do realize I bought my ticket when Amy and I were broken up? I hope you didn’t need anything in that case ’cause it’s closed.
13047,Sheldon,Yeah so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume you know most frightening most authentic most accurate visual representation of a scientific principle.
13048,Sheldon,Ow it does hurt.
13049,Howard,How about uh oh how about we might be Footprints on the Moon but your kind words sent us over the moon.
13050,Howard,Yeah.
13051,Leonard,You were right.
13052,Howard,Actually in this case I think she was.
13053,Sheldon,Well now that I think about it that would be most helpful.
13054,Leonard,So she’s expecting me to lie about going to a symposium in Pasadena when in actuality we’re pretending to go to a drug intervention in Long Beach?
13055,Howard,You know what I’m thinking? I’m thinking Howard wasn’t making a back-scratching metaphor. I’m thinking there was some actual scratching involved.
13056,Sheldon,He still hasn’t responded. What’s taking him so long?
13057,Sheldon,Yeah they have to I’m a biter.
13059,Howard,Hey Stuart!
13060,Sheldon,Not in these pants.
13061,Sheldon,For a man so good at predicting my moves how come you stink at 3-D chess?
13062,Sheldon,We’ll take some Funyuns.
13063,Howard,You think they came up with that? They were going to drink beer and play darts.
13064,Sheldon,My Mr Spock doll came to me in a dream and forced me to open it. And when the toy broke I switched it for yours. Later he encouraged me to do the right thing and I defied him. And then I was attacked by a Gorn.
13065,Sheldon,Don’t be ridiculous. What would I do with corn?
13066,Sheldon,That’s your badge of honour your warrior’s wound if you will. I was wrong minstrels will write songs about you.
13067,Sheldon,What are you doing here?
13068,Penny,We know what’s going on Sheldon!
13069,Howard,Are you joking? Star Trek V is the standard against which all badness is measured.
13070,Leonard,Very pretty.
13071,Sheldon,Yes. I don’t care for unconscious thoughts. My brain and I are best friends. It should tell me everything.
13072,Leonard,No.
13073,Sheldon,1993. Leon Lett blew the game in the final seconds and the Dolphins emerged victorious. Then I finally got to do my calculus.
13074,Penny,Well and what happened to you?
13075,Sheldon,Chinese food vintage video games. After the nightmare of Anything Can Happen Thursday this is Friday night the way it was meant to be.
13076,Howard,Okay let’s talk about something else.
13077,Leonard,Trust me this will be just fine.
13078,Penny,I know what I did. I bet they had to throw out that rocking chair. You know I can be romantic if I want to.
13079,Penny,I know. I’m really proud of Sheldon.
13080,Leonard,Ah here it is. Whoa. I haven’t looked at these in years. Robot girlfriend.
13081,Sheldon,My apologies. What’s your plan.
13082,Raj,Dude my parents just split up.
13083,Howard,Is there another Penny here? I had such plans. I had dreams. I was going to be the Indira Gandhi of particle astro-physics. But with a penis of course.
13084,Leonard,Oh uh he’ll be okay once the women are mixed into the crowd. He only has a problem when they’re one on one and smell nice.
13085,Penny,Oh that’s awful.
13086,Raj,Fo’ shizzle.
13087,Sheldon,I’ll do it provided I can perform the ceremony in Klingon.
13088,Leonard,Ooh. That’s his take on John Wheeler’s quantum foam. That should be great.
13089,Sheldon,Hello everyone. Oh Beverly good to see you. I’d love to chat but there’s a line that could start moving any minute so let’s do this. Amy? A proper apology requires three steps. Step one an admission of wrongdoing. Amy I was wrong. Step two a promise never to repeat said action. Amy that action will never be repeated and that’s a promise. Step three an earnest request for forgiveness. Amy I hope you can forgive me. And I hope you do it right now ’cause there’s an Uber waiting downstairs and I don’t want to repeat this apology nonsense with my driver Ganesh.
13090,Leonard,So am I driving you to work or are you still mad at me?
13091,Sheldon,Then what?
13092,Leonard,Oh we didn’t screw around. We just got drunk and made out.
13093,Leonard,No no no no you’re you’re unhappy there and then you’re gonna blame me for making you stay and it’s fine I’ll just I’ll suck it up.
13094,Sheldon,Yeah which I was initially sceptical of until I saw online that they serve Yorkshire pudding.
13095,Penny,Oh you’re welcome.
13096,Sheldon,Tea. When people are upset the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages. There there. You want to talk about it?
13097,Raj,Good riddle huh?
13098,Howard,Disappointed? Let down?
13099,Howard,Should we try to console him?
13100,Penny,Well if it makes you feel any better I’m not feeling so hot either.
13101,Howard,Come on Howard help me.
13102,Howard,Which is?
13103,Howard,At least my nose is naturally brown.
13104,Sheldon,What’s real? What isn’t? How can I know?
13105,Leonard,We were up to you.
13106,Sheldon,Well we may never know. As my mother would say the Asians are an inscrutable folk. Now if you’ll excuse me I have work to do.
13107,Sheldon,I think that’s incredibly sexist of you. I believe in a gender-blind society like in Star Trek where women and men of all races and creeds work side by side as equals.
13108,Sheldon,Young’s modulus.
13109,Penny,I think about a lot of things. I think about us getting married I think about us breaking up. Once in a while I think about how I didn’t leave a note on that Mercedes I dinged in the parking lot last month but then I have a glass of wine and it passes.
13110,Howard,Follow your heart.
13111,Sheldon,It is extraordinary.
13112,Raj,Nobody does. I was embarrassed so I didn’t say anything.
13113,Sheldon,Leonard? Maybe you’d like to go with them to meet girls.
13114,Sheldon,It’s an outrage. Honestly I’m tempted to leave the university.
13115,Sheldon,Okay that is it. 
13116,Sheldon,Oh. Well then come or don’t. I don’t care.
13117,Howard,That is so beautiful.
13118,Leonard,Okay so this is the main Comic-Con floor. It’s where all the vendors and exhibits are.
13119,Penny,What do you want?
13120,Raj,Uh excuse me Mrs. Davis?
13121,Sheldon,Oh-ho! Really? Well here’s another nit for you. The flagons would not have been made of polypropylene.
13122,Sheldon,And be a social pariah? Oh you know that’s not my style.
13123,Raj,Groundbreaking revelations tropical drinks. Tell me this isn’t like the best episode of Sex and the City.
13124,Sheldon,Oh yes. It runs on the world’s most powerful graphics chip imagination.
13125,Penny,Where the hell d’you find that?
13126,Sheldon,A requirement for string theory or M-theory if you will is the existence of such monopoles. I myself led an expedition to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles. Kripke I found the nozzle! I’m going to kill you!
13127,Howard,Uh maybe it’ll come up when I apply for citizenship. Oh crap what if it comes up when I apply for citizenship?
13128,Sheldon,Well no no I’m not going to go so far as to say that I represent a distinct new stage in humankind you know a Homo Novus if you will no that’s for anthropologists to decide. But I am convinced that the reason I cannot master the plebeian task of driving is because I’m not meant to.
13129,Sheldon,I think you should turn on the GPS.
13130,Sheldon,One question.
13131,Sheldon,No you’re a tool I was using to make my point.
13132,Leonard,Great. Did we say a time?
13133,Leonard,Yes we missed our lecture we were almost arrested and you got me locked in a room with a man who forced his tongue down the throat of a stuffed Wookiee.
13134,Penny,Yes.
13135,Sheldon,Amy. Why would you give me a word? Now if I play extract it would be cheating.
13137,Penny,What’s the matter?
13138,Raj,She was sleeping with you?
13139,Howard,And you didn’t think to tell me?
13140,Sheldon,Really?
13142,Sheldon,Why would you do that?
13144,Sheldon,You are truly wise.
13145,Howard,In a minute. Howard stepped outside to throw up.
13146,Howard,So I’ve been trying to come up with a cute couple’s nickname for me and Emily. What do you like better? Emippali or Koothrapemily?
13147,Leonard,Is your dad paying for it?
13148,Leonard,Ah well what’s this? A pot of oatmeal? Or thanks to you what I will now call gloatmeal.
13149,Penny,Yeah not bad not bad.
13150,Penny,You want me to buy thirty years worth of tampons?
13151,Penny,Howard you’re going to throw away a great girl like Bernadette because you’re holding out for some ridiculous fantasy?
13152,Leonard,No. And she’s not a lady she’s just a new neighbour.
13153,Sheldon,Leonard the nucleus? That makes no sense. I’m the whimsical elf that everyone looks to for a good time.
13154,Leonard,I’d love to but we need liquid helium and our shipment’s on back order for a month.
13155,Raj,Ah. Nothing makes beer taste better than cool clear Rocky Mountain spring water. Where are the Rocky Mountains anyway?
13156,Leonard,No.
13157,Penny,We were all thinking it really. It was kind of the elephant in the room so…
13158,Leonard,Hey. Want to join us?
13159,Raj,Wow. How’s that Hater-Ade taste bro? Hey this isn’t the way to work.
13160,Howard,That’s a mirror.
13161,Sheldon,Uh we don’t discuss anything. Leonard is the signatory to the Roommate Agreement. As such he bears responsibility for all your infractions and must pay all fines.
13162,Leonard,Wait Sheldon gave me a banana in a box. He was testing me too.
13163,Raj,No. I took her for coffee and she snuck out the bathroom window to get away from me.
13164,Penny,Yes please.  You’ll never guess who they got to replace you at work…
13165,Sheldon,All right.
13166,Raj,If you could feel how soft my skin is you wouldn’t have to ask.
13167,Howard,Well you get bit by a radioactive animal in a lab you kind of want to turn into a superhero.
13168,Howard,Five million three hundred eighteen thousand and eight?
13169,Leonard,What are you doing?
13170,Sheldon,Mom what an unexpected pleasure.
13171,Howard,So I was thinking maybe we can come up with a name for the asteroid by combining our names.
13172,Leonard,Dr. Jeffries hello again. Leonard Hofstadter.
13173,Leonard,I agree. Sheldon’s sister is hiding at Penny’s because we’ve all been hitting on her at the same time.
13174,Sheldon,I assumed you would.
13175,Penny,Aw. You are the best boyfriend ever.
13176,Leonard,Okay fasten your seat belt.
13177,Raj,Congratulations.
13178,Leonard,Why do you do that? Can’t you let me have my moment?
13179,Howard,Woo-hoo!
13180,Sheldon,Plus there’s almost no chance we’ll see any of our coworkers half naked.
13181,Leonard,He wasn’t in a car but okay.
13182,Penny,Amy don’t be like that.
13184,Leonard,Problem?
13185,Penny,Wait who’s Tor?
13186,Raj,Two.
13187,Sheldon,Pchew!
13188,Howard,Who died and made you king of moments?
13189,Penny,Well I just think that maybe you’re a little hung up on the money because I’m less reliant on you now and that’s a little scary.
13190,Leonard,What about me?
13191,Leonard,Oh my God you are amazing. I mean I don’t deserve you. Wh what do what do you mean everybody?
13192,Leonard,What are you talking about?
13193,Howard,In fact it’s better if you don’t otherwise it makes the rest of us look bad.
13194,Raj,We hope. The signal has to travel over three billion miles. So it’s gonna be hours before we know if it even survived.
13195,Sheldon,He doesn’t really want Penny to go to Comic-Con. He’s just doing it to make her happy.
13196,Sheldon,Blue as in depressed.
13197,Sheldon,Yes I want you to apologize to Leonard.
13198,Leonard,Yeah. Hang on. Sheldon!
13199,Leonard,I’m glad you agree. I hired some guys to help us move it come on in fellas. 
13200,Raj,Please Sheldon I’m a lost Indian boy far from home and I want a girlfriend and I want her to be Abby and she’ll only come over if she can bring Martha.
13201,Sheldon,You mean the box right?
13202,Penny,Oh nice.
13203,Sheldon,How is that possible? I’ve hardly spoken to you since we got on the train.
13204,Howard,Well I’ve never seen you here before Claire.
13205,Howard,What are you doing right now?
13206,Sheldon,I signal my contempt for your cruel plan to shove Christmas joy down my throat by making a gesture that says get a load of this guy.
13207,Sheldon,Has your relationship reached its inevitable ugly end?
13208,Sheldon,No I don’t. And neither do you.
13209,Howard,Wait. Can you at least tell me what went wrong? It’s okay. I can take anything. Unless it’s something I did or said or am. ‘Cause those are like my buttons.
13210,Leonard,I’m hoping that’s three different guys.
13211,Leonard,Will you knock it off? We’re across the hall.
13212,Sheldon,And look how irritable it’s making you!
13213,Sheldon,Not as relieved as I’m about to be. It’s a brave new world little lady.
13214,Sheldon,Then who is?
13215,Penny,Right. Still mad at me about that?
13216,Penny,What’s this cartoon called again?
13217,Howard,Sounds like a lot of work.
13218,Sheldon,No I didn’t try I succeeded. In fact I was briefly able to see the inside of my sister’s guinea pig Snowball before he caught fire. It led to an interesting expression in our house not a snowball’s chance in a cat scanner.
13219,Sheldon,I would’ve preferred to have you there with me.
13220,Sheldon,Of course I am. Removing Joe Chill as the killer of Batman’s parents effectively deprived him of his raison d’être.
13221,Sheldon,A common spare. The Miss Congeniality of the bowling pageant. Before you jump on Twitter to tout your modest accomplishment watch how it’s really done. I am the ball. My thoughts are its thoughts. Its holes are my holes.  Yes. Tweet that Tweety Bird.
13222,Sheldon,She’s 93. She won’t be disappointed for very long.
13223,Penny,And I’m laughing like I did the first time I heard it.
13224,Sheldon,Oh I’m aware. It features Whoopi Goldberg. She played Guinan on Star Trek Next Gen. Penny Next Gen refers to Star Trek…
13225,Penny,Hey I just wanted to bring you a little housewarming gift.
13227,Leonard,Well I did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast which could give a positive urine test for opiates but certainly not dilate my pupils so I guess there’s no point in bringing it up.
13228,Sheldon,It’s important.
13229,Sheldon,Am I? Yesterday I had an Air Force project a girlfriend who lived with me and my good friend Raj right across the hall.
13230,Howard,You know who’s got to be the bravest person in the Marvel Universe? Whoever has to give She-Hulk a bikini wax.
13231,Howard,I will see you gentlemen later.
13232,Sheldon,Then I’ll look from the door of my heavenly home and pity the miner that mines my poor bones.
13233,Sheldon,Yes. Oh I’m so excited. And I just can’t hide it.
13234,Howard,Not even to sleep?
13235,Leonard,Sorry buddy.
13236,Leonard,Really? You love them?
13237,Leonard,Yeah you all do. Anyway I feel like he’s hitting on her. She says he’s just being nice and that I should trust her.
13238,Sheldon,No Leonard go ahead and mock. Like my daddy always said Shelly women aren’t anything but flippin’ pains in the bottom.
13239,Sheldon,Hello Penny.
13240,Sheldon,Do you realize that teaching is the first thing I’ve failed at since my ill-fated attempt to complete a chin-up in March of 1989?
13241,Sheldon,I think I know.
13242,Raj,Plane tickets? Yeah.
13243,Raj,Ooh I’ll uh text Stuart let him know we’re close.
13244,Leonard,She’s pretty good huh?
13245,Leonard,No.
13246,Penny,What are you doing?
13247,Raj,What do you want Sheldon?
13248,Leonard,Yeah. But now he’s happy to let people think he’s responsible for everything.
13249,Sheldon,Fine. Okay. Now on this side I am closer to the exit in case of emergency.
13250,Sheldon,Hello. How’s the final stage of your nicotine addiction study going?
13251,Raj,Maybe you could run some computer simulations.
13252,Sheldon,I am not a know-it-all. I’m a person who knows lots of things and likes to correct other people when they’re wrong.
13253,Sheldon,Well if it’s of any help I’ve read all the great moral philosophers including Dr. Seuss.
13254,Leonard,I asked.
13255,Leonard,Nothing? It sounds like you got caught speeding going 4000 miles an hour.
13256,Howard,Hi.
13257,Penny,Why don’t you give it a try Sheldon?
13258,Leonard,There’s no hurry Mother tell them more about their secret love for each other.
13259,Sheldon,How? You had the whole floor to yourself.
13261,Sheldon,I found him. He’s in the bathroom. President Siebert?
13262,Sheldon,I’m not surprised.
13263,Leonard,Hey Sheldon I’ve got someone here who might make you feel better.
13264,Sheldon,Hello Penny. I realize you’re currently at the mercy of your primitive biological urges but as you have an entire lifetime of poor decisions ahead of you may I interrupt this one?
13266,Leonard,What are you saying? We’re not coordinated enough to play sports?
13267,Sheldon,Yes yes. Yeah I’m definitely going with colonoscopy.
13268,Leonard,What do you want.
13269,Penny,Oh sure sure yeah. Very Christmassy.
13270,Howard,Ordinary yet I sense it is dripping with magical potential.
13271,Raj,Oh no. I hope everything’s okay.
13272,Sheldon,Never mind. I still can’t tell you.
13273,Raj,Cocktain shrimp are $12.50.
13274,Leonard,So is that one mine.
13275,Leonard,They’re bigger than mine.
13276,Penny,Happy Valentine’s Day.
13277,Penny,Okay but the Jennifer Aniston movie has Jennifer Aniston and she’s not building a dam.
13278,Howard,Shall we toast?
13279,Sheldon,Okay. Amy’s decided she wants to move in with me so I need you to come back home you lovable scamp. That’s a lot of product.
13280,Howard,Yeah just leave me out of it. You know if they come here and see crap everywhere they’re just gonna blame the Indian guy.
13281,Penny,Oh okay. Well I was hoping um you could do me a favour.
13282,Leonard,Yes I was there.
13283,Leonard,Oh good. Do you have any fabric softener?
13284,Penny,So you lied to her. Also interesting.
13285,Sheldon,Nah I’ll do it tomorrow.
13286,Penny,There you go.
13287,Raj,So uh what game are you… Oh. Crap.
13288,Leonard,Do you think a sexually ambivalent Indian astrophysicist with selective mutism and alcohol issues is better than a hundred-pound Jewish guy who lives with his mom?
13289,Raj,Fine. You’re in Sheldon Square.
13290,Sheldon,Is that all you have? Shopworn tidbits like talk to her and let it go? Gee Penny life’s giving me lemons. What should I do?
13291,Sheldon,Go ahead.
13292,Sheldon,Excuse me. This changes nothing. Except the Halloween costume I’m wearing this year. Amy you’re going to be Olive Oyl. Lay off the doughnuts.
13293,Raj,Damn it he’s good at that too.
13294,Leonard,Ooh look an Indiana Jones connect-the-dots.
13295,Sheldon,Oh that wasn’t clear. Try it again but this time drive it home with how do you like them apples Missy?
13296,Sheldon,Then we’re probably okay.
13297,Sheldon,Well sure.
13298,Leonard,Subtle.
13299,Penny,Leonard if you’re mad about this just tell me.
13300,Leonard,But if you’re ever short there’s always a couple of fifties in Green Lantern’s ass.
13301,Penny,What you wouldn’t trust him?
13302,Sheldon,Or in German a Besserwisser.
13303,Leonard,Booting.
13304,Raj,What?
13306,Leonard,Just tell me.
13307,Sheldon,Oh a scroll. I like scrolls. They’re my third favourite system of transmitting the written word. After stone tablets and skywriting. You have all been summoned to join a thrilling Dungeons and Dragons adventure. Your quest begins in a secret northern village of elves who have all been massacred. I like where this is heading. Your task is to rescue their leader from a dungeon of ogres. Oh that’s a saucy twist. That leader’s name Santa Claus. No no no.
13308,Howard,You you’re kidding. That’s fantastic!
13309,Leonard,Next game let’s switch helmets.
13310,Penny,What about her?
13311,Leonard,We owe you an apology.
13312,Penny,Well why don’t you tell her?
13313,Leonard,No. But it was okay. I mean when I was little I’d think maybe my parents would change their mind and surprise me with a party like this one birthday I came home from my Cello lesson and I saw a lot of strange cars parked out front and when I got to the door I could hear people whispering and I could smell German chocolate cake which is my favourite.
13314,Sheldon,I see. And is that open for discussion?
13315,Leonard,Who is this Justin?
13316,Sheldon,Bread.
13317,Penny,Do you even like the Beach Boys?
13318,Sheldon,What? Is there another twist coming? Is the baby not theirs at all?
13319,Sheldon,Maybe when I publish it I’ll include an inhaler.
13320,Leonard,Okay fine like a pinky swear.
13321,Leonard,Because I didn’t want there to be any secrets between us.
13322,Howard,Hey don’t discourage him. This is a fantastic opportunity.
13323,Leonard,Look on the bright side she might turn out to be a nice beautiful girl.
13324,Howard,Why don’t you ask her to come up?
13325,Leonard,Are you kidding me?
13326,Leonard,Yeah.
13327,Raj,Hey Penny can you give me a hand with this?
13328,Sheldon,A hotel? Did you see The Shining?
13329,Leonard,Oh Sheldon we don’t need a meeting every three months.
13330,Leonard,Because I don’t need his girlfriend to set me up with one of her girlfriends. I’m perfectly capable of finding a girl on my own.
13331,Howard,Thank you.
13332,Leonard,I’m not sure. Just feels a little anticlimactic.
13333,Sheldon,Hmm. A while back YouTube changed its user interface from a star-based rating system to a thumbs-up rating system. I tell people I’m okay with it but I’m really not.
13334,Leonard,In love yet?
13336,Sheldon,But she’s not my favourite of the X-Men in order that would be Wolverine Cyclops oh wait I forgot Professor X. Professor X Wolverine Cyclops Iceman then Storm Angel the Beast oh wait Nightcrawler. Professor X Nightcrawler Wolverine Cyclops Iceman then Storm Angel….
13337,Penny,No.
13338,Raj,That is so not true.
13339,Sheldon,That you’re having to process your emotional pain without vodka?
13340,Penny,Thank you.
13341,Leonard,You can if you try. Think about it this way if I were Batman and you were Alfred you’d keep that secret. Right?
13342,Leonard,I’m gonna go home and take a nap.
13343,Penny,Sheldon wait this isn’t even what I do. I’m a waitress not a busboy.
13344,Sheldon,Of course. She’s spent many nights here and you’re worried about preserving the myth of her virginity before the wedding.
13345,Penny,Nice. I got him a sweater.
13346,Raj,That is weird. I thought he was like 45.
13347,Penny,Oh come on we’re all grown-ups. We’ve all done it.
13348,Penny,Right okay. What was he like when he was young?
13349,Leonard,Right. Listen to me. We can’t do anything until you do your part. So get up in front of this whiteboard and do it.
13350,Penny,You don’t how much your rent is?
13351,Sheldon,I’m sorry.  Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?
13352,Raj,I’m in.
13353,Howard,Okay.
13354,Sheldon,Let’s celebrate.
13355,Leonard,Thank you.
13356,Sheldon,Thank you. 
13357,Raj,Which part?
13358,Leonard,How is that building on what he just said?
13359,Raj,Leonard just realized that Penny’s been hiding him from her friends because he’s a tiny little man who flies kites.
13360,Leonard,Movies yes.
13361,Leonard,I know. When is she going home?
13362,Leonard,Hey.
13363,Howard,Well not so much depressed as lonely.
13364,Leonard,Okay we need to stop for a minute.
13365,Leonard,Stop yelling at me.
13366,Sheldon,I don’t know what the protocol is here. Do I stay do I leave? Do I wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage?
13367,Penny,Oh!
13368,Penny,Sweetie you really thought I’d want to do this?
13369,Sheldon,Like a big old baby.
13371,Sheldon,The stock boy at Walgreens was frustratingly uninformed on the subject.
13372,Raj,Uh it wasn’t anything weird. It was just to see how big they were.
13373,Raj,Oh we could set it up like a scavenger hunt where the last puzzle gives the winner Sheldon’s contact information.
13374,Sheldon,Please all comments and questions should be flag-related.
13375,Penny,Yeah I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been at a party where everyone’s talking about flags and I just couldn’t join in.
13376,Leonard,Well yeah.
13377,Penny,Oh. Okay. Sheldon I I’ve got to ask how did you figure out that it was the geology lab?
13378,Leonard,Just get in here.
13379,Sheldon,That’s true. He collected and delivered the ark to the proper authorities for filing.
13380,Sheldon,Who cares? He stole the idea and doesn’t deserve his own joke.
13381,Leonard,Look do you want to buy me out or not?
13382,Leonard,Infinite Sheldon?
13383,Raj,Wait. Can you at least tell me what went wrong? It’s okay. I can take anything. Unless it’s something I did or said or am. ‘Cause those are like my buttons.
13384,Sheldon,Oh you know. the lone star state. Hmm. That should be its Yelp rating.
13385,Leonard,Yes.
13386,Howard,What can I do? I can’t stop thinking about her.
13387,Sheldon,Is there a reason I had to leave my own apartment?
13388,Leonard,At least they talked about you on Letterman. Come on I can drive you wherever you need to go.
13389,Sheldon,Okay that’s question 20 you have to guess.
13390,Leonard,But we won’t bore you with the details.
13391,Sheldon,Of course not. I’m too busy to be sick.
13392,Penny,Sweetie every night you don’t kill him in his sleep he wins.
13393,Howard,But this isn’t about the jewellery. This is about me having a place where I can open up about my feelings.
13394,Penny,I love him but if he’s broken let’s not get a new one.
13395,Sheldon,What if a simulated van rear-ends me?
13396,Leonard,What?
13397,Raj,Anyway I’m among a handful of scientists that have been asked to submit a design proposal for the message and its delivery system.
13398,Sheldon,Well why isn’t everyone happy? Your little ray of sunshine is ready to beam again.
13399,Sheldon,Oh sorry uh carrot chunk.
13400,Penny,Oh yeah me too. Zip it lock it.  Put it in your pocket. So you and Leonard…
13401,Leonard,Howard he’s fifteen.
13402,Sheldon,Look a side door. Come on Short Round.
13403,Howard,Well he could have been hit by a bus. You don’t know.
13404,Leonard,I’m sorry. So listen I heard something about him. Can you keep it between us?
13405,Leonard,Congratulations!
13406,Leonard,Howard’s right that’ll never work.
13407,Sheldon,I’ll just roll for you.
13409,Leonard,Oh you poor thing you’re sweating. That’s so much worse than having your car stolen.
13410,Raj,Fantastic Four Daredevil Invincible Iron Man Happy Hogan Curt Connors…
13411,Sheldon,Rajesh I’ve had the privilege of working alongside you for many years. My recommendation is that you gobble these up like Tic Tacs.
13412,Sheldon,Priya has essentially nullified my roommate agreement with Leonard making life in the apartment very uncomfortable for me.
13413,Sheldon,Okay well good night.
13414,Leonard,I’m not going to work.
13415,Sheldon,Little Miss “grown ups don’t play with toys”. If I were to go into that apartment right now would I find Beanie Babies? Are you not an accumulator of Care Bears and My Little Ponies? And who is that Japanese feline I see frolicking on your shorts? HelloHello Kitty!
13416,Sheldon,Gentlemen the most interesting thing just happened with this spoon.
13417,Penny,Are you kidding? That’s what you always do. Think harder.
13418,Leonard,No.
13419,Sheldon,That doesn’t make any sense. She knows I have a girlfriend.
13421,Sheldon,That’s great.
13422,Leonard,Relax there’s room for two babies in this group.
13423,Sheldon,Because I am.
13424,Raj,Hello.
13425,Sheldon,There you go.
13426,Howard,Sure.
13427,Leonard,No I just got a text from Stuart. Brent Spiner is at the party.
13428,Sheldon,Screw him he was weak.
13429,Sheldon,Thanks for coming with me.
13430,Leonard,Not really.
13431,Leonard,By the way if anyone asks the elevator shaft always had a tree in it.
13432,Sheldon,Leonard I’m a physicist not a hippie.
13434,Leonard,Really?
13435,Sheldon,Last week you told Leonard he couldn’t wear his Wookie jacket out in public.
13436,Raj,Of course it does. Didn’t your baby room have a theme?
13437,Sheldon,Excuse me we just went over this. As the quintessential middle child your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention.
13438,Leonard,Hang on. Sheldon is proving that you are single-handedly smarter than everyone else so important that you would rather lose by yourself than win as part of a team.
13439,Penny,Okay well we’ll talk to you guys later. Bye. She said not to come. It’s gonna be a while.
13440,Raj,Thank you. It wasn’t easy.
13441,Sheldon,Fine. Women huh?
13442,Sheldon,You’re holding two moderate spell cards a small rock and a potion of Zancor which will be about as much help as an air conditioner on the ice planet Hoth. Your only move is to play the potion lose the skirmish and two moves later the game.
13443,Leonard,What’s wrong?
13444,Sheldon,Story problem? You oh Amy what a dewy-eyed moon-calf you are. Raiders of the Lost Ark is the love child of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas two of the most gifted filmmakers of our generation. I’ve watched it 36 times except for the snake scene and the face-melting scene which I can only watch when it’s still light out but I defy you to find a story problem. Here’s my jaw drop it.
13445,Leonard,That is not a compromise. A compromise is me driving you everywhere because you refuse to learn how.
13446,Leonard,Yeah yeah. Uh see here’s the thing after you leave I still have to live with him.
13447,Leonard,That’s not an email that’s Leslie’s facebook page.
13448,Penny,All right. Hang on.
13449,Leonard,What do you want to do?
13450,Penny,Thanks. There’s no reason why I shouldn’t be the best bisexual go-go dancer slowly transforming into a killer gorilla anyone’s ever seen.
13451,Penny,It really bothers him?
13452,Leonard,Yes what?
13453,Raj,Oh grow up. I was lying. I lie all the time. Nobody wants to kiss me.
13454,Howard,She didn’t take my order.
13455,Penny,Oh my God he won’t stop.
13456,Sheldon,What’s the number I’ll match it.
13457,Leonard,Wow. No it’s great. Also uh mint in box.
13458,Sheldon,I’ll get the blankets. You Google how to have childlike fun.
13459,Leonard,That’s it. I don’t I don’t have to put up with this.
13460,Sheldon,This is moving faster than we thought.
13461,Penny,You liked my short hair right?
13462,Howard,It wasn’t so are you in?
13464,Sheldon,Now are you sure? Everyone’s smoking them. I think they’re the best.
13465,Penny,All right yeah I’ll play along. What was my first strike?
13466,Leonard,Thank you Dr. Cooper.
13467,Leonard,Where’s Batman?
13468,Raj,Oh that’s very impressive. And a little racist.
13469,Penny,Guys how ’bout some music?
13470,Leonard,The doctor said I should be out of surgery by ten.
13471,Sheldon,Penny everything is better with Bluetooth.
13472,Sheldon,Hello.
13473,Sheldon,Ah normally I refrain from alcohol but since my cerebral cortex is twiddling its proverbial thumbs why not soak it in grape juice that’s been predigested by a fungus?
13474,Sheldon,It’s an experiment.
13475,Leonard,Yeah you did. So uh listen it was great to see you again. And  and and thanks for the apology.
13476,Leonard,Hey. What are you doing here?
13477,Leonard,Well now that you point it out…
13478,Howard,Look Penny you’re great but I had a long talk with my parents and they said if I date an Indian girl I get a Maserati.
13479,Penny,Oh for God’s sake. Look he’s a physicist who’s trying to figure out what his next field of study should be.
13480,Howard,Come on Sheldon. Amy’s only gone for a few months. And now that I’m moving out your old room is empty so you can stay there whenever you want.
13481,Sheldon,It would seem Amy is drunk in a liquor store parking lot.
13482,Leonard,Uh I don’t know. They’re pretty different.
13483,Sheldon,Hello.
13484,Sheldon,If you recall I pointed out the “check engine” light to you several months ago.
13485,Penny,What are you doing?
13486,Penny,What’s all this?
13487,Penny,Leonard look! Sheldon’s hugging me.
13488,Raj,You laughed.
13489,Penny,Why not?
13490,Leonard,Oh don’t anthropomorphize him he’s got big eyes but his feelings are not like ours.
13491,Sheldon,I’m sorry I’ve upset you. I shouldn’t have asked so many questions.
13492,Penny,Look I like hanging out with you guys but I’m not going to apologize for something I didn’t do.
13493,Penny,You could have a Long Island Iced Tea.
13494,Penny,Um any chance his car needs to be washed by a girl in a bikini? No. Okay I’m really sorry for wasting your time.
13495,Penny,Uh-huh!
13496,Penny,Oh honey I don’t know. Things are a little weird with Leonard right now.
13497,Penny,Are you asking me out?
13498,Leonard,Yep. Here’s some money.
13499,Leonard,Oh my mother.
13500,Penny,Is there any scenario where we’re not in full body paint?
13501,Penny,Just say thank you.
13502,Sheldon,You really need to work on your penmanship.
13503,Raj,This van was owned and driven by your personal physics hero Richard Feynman.
13504,Raj,Well they weren’t speaking at the time so he had a servant say it to her. Oh maybe I could make a gift for them. I know how much you guys love the coasters I made for you.
13505,Leonard,So? We’ll start now.
13506,Leonard,You don’t say?
13507,Penny,Your parents are old. Anything unspeakable was finished by 930. Go to sleep.
13508,Howard,Stop knocking! It’s open! Please tell my parents that our dark matter research is at a critical juncture and I can’t come home for my cousin Sanjay’s wedding.
13509,Penny,Well if he’s good in bed she can throw him a fish.
13510,Leonard,So what do you say?
13511,Penny,Okay have a safe trip.
13512,Leonard,Really? Uh sure doesn’t read that way.
13513,Sheldon,Mmm you are not going to come out of this looking good.
13514,Howard,No. 
13515,Leonard,Yeah he’s fine he’s just a little rattled.
13516,Sheldon,No she’s my guest. If anyone should offer her anything it should be me. Elizabeth can I get you something? Perhaps a feminine hygiene product or a bowel-regulating yogurt?
13517,Penny,Yeah yeah yeah shhh!
13518,Leonard,Would the new Sheldon be in any way an improvement on the old Sheldon?
13519,Penny,Yeah it’s a great time to be alive isn’t it?
13520,Leonard,Guava?
13521,Leonard,I did but it’s been a while and I wanted to sound smart over breakfast.
13522,Raj,Okay let me have it. Let’s hear all the Raj is a girl jokes.
13523,Penny,That’s me I’m her. You know he didn’t trick me he just wore me down.
13524,Sheldon,It’s a comic book convention. You know it’s like pizza or particle accelerators even the stinky one’s still pretty good.
13525,Sheldon,Don’t fall for it. He’ll get you to compare him to a dead virgin and suddenly you’re the bad guy.
13526,Howard,Well I hope you saved room for chocolate lava cake.
13527,Sheldon,You’re telling it wrong. Ira to really understand the story here you have to start at the very beginning. A small town in East Texas where a young genius named…
13528,Penny,Oh oh here we go.
13529,Leonard,Okay. And to defend I roll two sixes. I win.
13530,Leonard,Two women at the same time? Nice job playa.
13531,Leonard,Sheldon why are you jumping up and down?
13532,Raj,Smooth.
13533,Howard,Hey guys what’s up?
13534,Penny,Well you can’t say he didn’t give it a fair shot.
13535,Howard,We’re scientists. We observe everything. Here go buy yourself a scone.
13536,Leonard,Okay uh if I get lucky I’ll take her to my stately manor outside Gotham City and if you get lucky I’ll sleep on the moon.
13537,Sheldon,Howard we’ve all seen your mother naked. That woman needs to learn how to tie a robe.
13538,Leonard,Thanks.
13539,Penny,Here drink this. It’ll relax you.
13540,Leonard,It’s just not a good time.
13541,Penny,Probably but in their own homes.
13542,Leonard,Buh-buh-buh-buh! What do you want for it?
13543,Penny,Oh so you believe your friend and your friend’s wife and your own eyes over me? Wow.
13544,Sheldon,Then I suppose you could have agreed to go.
13545,Sheldon,Oh this isn’t for Leonard no. Amy bought it for me.
13546,Leonard,Does that step include chloroform and a roll of duct tape?
13547,Leonard,Yes I do. The only reason I went is because you wanted to see them and I wanted to have sex. To this day I can’t see a Sandra Bullock movie poster without getting both bored and aroused.
13548,Raj,Hey what’s up?
13549,Raj,Hey. What brings you by?
13550,Howard,Well there’s a question I better have a good answer to before she gets back.
13551,Leonard,Where do you get this stuff?
13552,Penny,Okay Babydoll Pink let’s see if you can cover up the fact that I got my dad’s feet.
13553,Leonard,So?
13554,Penny,You’re just gonna leave him here?
13555,Raj,Phasers on the Borg! Charlie’s Angels.
13556,Raj,Oh this heat is brutal.
13557,Howard,Peer review? It’s People magazine. People picked me.
13558,Howard,Maybe we should see how he’s doing.
13559,Sheldon,For shame Leonard. For shame. And to think I was ready to waste the last of my good haemorrhoid cream on you.
13560,Howard,Oh well then I can actually feel the moisture going into my skin.
13561,Raj,I talk with my eyes.
13562,Sheldon,You insulted my woman. I’m here to defend her honour. Two! It was two.  Wil Wheaton! Now prepare yourself for what may come.
13563,Leonard,I don’t have a problem with your driving.
13564,Raj,Do you think this is cool?
13565,Penny,Uh that’s so silly.
13566,Raj,Sheldon doesn’t get along with Sheldon. It’s still no reason for me to have to listen to you arm your photon torpedoes every night.
13567,Leonard,I know I’m familiar with you.
13568,Sheldon,Hmm.
13570,Leonard,Yeah.
13571,Penny,Okay. If you can’t get me to stop eating your food what makes you think you can get me to stop using your Wi-Fi?
13572,Sheldon,That’s preposterous. I do not resemble C3PO. Don’t get me wrong I’m flattered I just don’t see it.
13573,Sheldon,No one asked you Uhura.
13574,Sheldon,I know that’s why I shortened it.
13575,Leonard,You bumped the table and you know it.
13576,Raj,They don’t call me Brown Dynamite for nothing.
13577,Sheldon,You were in my… why would you… what are you saying?
13578,Leonard,Sorry! Oop!
13579,Leonard,Pretty much. Except we keep our shirts on in the sauna.
13580,Howard,To what? Toy Story?
13581,Howard,I’ll tell you where it’s coming from. All you do is make fun of me for coming to girls’ night and now you’re here ruining it for everyone.
13582,Penny,I don’t know check your body for tattoos?
13583,Raj,What?
13584,Raj,Yeah yeah. Sure. What’s up?
13585,Sheldon,Hurry up find him find him.
13586,Howard,I’m not finishing your sentence. You pulled the plug on my funk.
13587,Sheldon,Will you please play the game? I can’t spy with my little eye something passing right through us.
13588,Penny,Yeah you’ve been going out for years. You haven’t even slept together.
13589,Sheldon,Can I get any of those with little frankfurter slices and home made croutons?
13590,Penny,No I was talking to the bird.
13591,Sheldon,Okay. I’m sorry I gave you such a hard time I just had to be sure.
13592,Sheldon,Well no-one’s going to run a DNA test on it Leonard honestly you over-think everything.
13593,Howard,Yeah but you were just sleeping because I forboded you to have sex.
13594,Leonard,Okay okay. Uh the analogy between space-time and a supercooled fluid is either meaningless or false. I wish this blog would devote itself to real science instead of wasting our time with crackpot wannabe theoreticians in a rush to publish.
13595,Leonard,Thank you.
13596,Leonard,Jealousy? What do I have to be jealous of?
13597,Raj,Yeah that’s true. In fact they liked the song so much they retooled the whole script around it.
13598,Howard,Well I’m very happy for you.
13599,Sheldon,All set.
13600,Penny,Uh since you’re paying for dinner I’ll let that slide. Open yours.
13601,Sheldon,Just to be clear here you’re asking for my assistance.
13602,Leonard,Yes.
13603,Leonard,Are you kidding? I once paid twenty dollars for Theo Sassler’s signature.
13604,Sheldon,Ooh sounds like that fellow knows what he’s talking about. I’d put on my listening ears if I were you.
13605,Sheldon,Well you’re my girlfriend and I don’t want you to be upset. Then again Wil Wheaton’s my friend and I don’t want him to be upset. Hmm this is a sticky wicket.  What do you think?
13606,Sheldon,Oh sure what a wonderful idea. And after that I’ll make up my own rules of oral hygiene. You know instead of flossing I’ll rub pudding on my gums. I’m going to get the number of the SyFy Channel and give them what for.
13607,Penny,I’m sorry what?
13608,Sheldon,Brent Spiner what have you done? That was an original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure signed by my close personal friend Wil Wheaton.
13609,Penny,All right well let me know if you guys want to go.
13610,Leonard,More than this?
13611,Howard,I don’t get it. You had a great time.
13612,Sheldon,Leonard? Are you sleeping?
13613,Sheldon,The name and the address drip with evil.
13614,Leonard,Who are you?
13615,Leonard,Wait wait wait wait wait wait. I’m gonna need more details.
13616,Howard,What are you eating?
13617,Penny,Well sometimes women don’t care. Sometimes it makes them want a guy even more.
13618,Sheldon,Little ball of fur. Keep rubbing.
13619,Howard,Sweet!
13620,Leonard,No he didn’t. Nothing that’s happening here is being done on purpose. Okay uh forget one-on-one. Let’s try a free throw contest. First person who makes a basket wins the office.
13621,Raj,I’m on a cloud. Swing me. 
13622,Leonard,But the mission wouldn’t be for at least a year. Isn’t that enough time to get your blood pressure under…
13623,Leonard,Have you seen him?
13626,Penny,Hi. Want to do yoga with me?
13627,Leonard,God I love you. I love you so much.
13628,Raj,They exist in case we ever make contact with an alien civilization.
13629,Sheldon,I just gave you a reasonable explanation.
13630,Penny,Why not?
13631,Penny,Hey guys.
13632,Penny,Amy you’re getting a text.
13633,Leonard,What’s wrong with a football jersey?
13634,Sheldon,Look I’m sorry. Tell me why Bernadette is upset with you.
13635,Sheldon,That’s a Raging Ogre.
13636,Raj,She said she recently went on a date with a guy named Roger? And he’s Indian? And he’s an astrophysicist too?
13637,Penny,Better acoustics for your throat singing?
13638,Sheldon,We had a good run you and I.
13639,Raj,Well I was feeling bad about how I acted the other night so I made you a little something.
13640,Penny,What is the harm if I audition?
13641,Penny,Hey you.
13642,Leonard,Nurse’s office.
13643,Sheldon,He didn’t date. It was pon farr. His blood boiled with mating lust.
13644,Sheldon,I don’t get it.
13645,Raj,It is funny when you think about it.
13646,Sheldon,I can’t do this. And for your information Leonard the upper flermin doesn’t grow between my shoulder blades it grows out of the belly button on my neck.
13647,Leonard,Hmm. Lisa’s gonna be disappointed.
13648,Howard,Yeah no. But yet here you two are still together. And that’s even after you and I had our crazy naked night.
13649,Howard,Wouldn’t you be upset if you saw Amy out with someone else?
13650,Howard,But e-excuse me I have something to say. None of you may realize it but I was very much looking forward to this weekend. It was gonna be like the old days the four of us hanging out playing video games before you guys all got girlfriends. Do you have any idea what it’s like to be the only one without a girlfriend? Even if I get one someday I’ll still be the guy who got a girl after Sheldon Cooper!
13651,Raj,I didn’t even know there was a President’s dining room.
13652,Raj,Wow your work on jellyfish neural nets sounds so interesting.
13653,Sheldon,Why don’t you want to get your mother from the airport?
13654,Leonard,Thank you.
13655,Penny,Uh Sheldon I think we’re good for now.
13656,Penny,No no. But in this case yes.
13657,Leonard,No.
13658,Leonard,What?
13659,Leonard,I know. You can spend your whole life working and at the end all that’s left are some papers in a box.
13660,Howard,And judging by her lack of Adam’s apple she’s been female her entire life. I like that in a woman.
13661,Leonard,Thank you. I’m a naive idiot right?
13662,Sheldon,What do you think I should do?
13663,Howard,Will do.
13664,Sheldon,That’s just the beginning. I also have an idea for a bulk mail-order feminine hygiene company. Oh glow in the dark tampons! Leonard we’re going to be rich.
13665,Penny,Leonard Hofstadter.
13666,Sheldon,No.
13667,Howard,Hey look at me I don’t have a foreskin.
13668,Sheldon,So I’ve been told. But I can’t understand what she has to complain about. I mean she has a front-row seat as I make scientific history. There’s string cheese in my mini-fridge and that’s for anyone. Yeah and just yesterday I led her away from a life of sexual promiscuity by making her look at pictures of disease-ridden genitalia.
13669,Sheldon,Oh no I see the confusion. No the intent behind that clause was to force you to take care of me when I’m ill. When you’re feeling better you’ll think that’s funny.
13670,Sheldon,You can try but you’ll never catch me. 
13671,Penny,What?
13672,Leonard,Well then you know her better than I do.
13673,Leonard,Give me that.
13674,Penny,Yeah.
13675,Howard,Anyone in?
13676,Raj,Well what do you want to write?
13677,Sheldon,It was rife with historical inaccuracies. For example the tavern girl serving flagons of mead now her costume was obviously Germanic but in 1487 the Bavarian purity laws or Rhineheitsgebot severely limited the availability of mead. At best they would have had some sort of spiced wine.
13678,Raj,Maybe he’s having a lover’s spat with Penny.
13679,Sheldon,Uh-oh. According to this Mexican customs website visitors may not bring more than five laser discs 20 compact discs or 12 VHS tapes.
13680,Howard,The bigger question is what are you gonna eat with that spoon? You didn’t get any food.
13681,Leonard,Glad I was sitting down for that. Did you and Amy get in a fight?
13682,Howard,Yeah-yeah which way?
13683,Sheldon,Well they can’t cancel it. It ended on a cliffhanger.
13684,Leonard,Hey.
13685,Leonard,Why is that good?
13686,Leonard,Bring a ball or a Frisbee you know something he can chase.
13687,Raj,But we don’t have tattoos. What if someone asks to see our tattoos?
13688,Raj,Is that racist? It feels racist.
13689,Sheldon,You’re driving me to the mall. I’m going to acquire a book that summarizes the current theories in the field of friendmaking.
13690,Howard,Oh snap.
13691,Penny,Oh. Oh well good for him. Yeah but why are you sitting here why don’t you just go to a movie or something?
13692,Leonard,The brake might be imaginary but that stop sign you just ran wasn’t.
13693,Sheldon,Oh I disagree. Stuart is taller artistic self-employed and most significantly he gets 45 percent off comic books.
13694,Sheldon,Have you seen the one where Lori dies?
13695,Leonard,Will you hold on to this for a couple of days?
13696,Sheldon,Will you please stop joking around? I’m trying to figure this out.
13697,Leonard,Hold on hold on. So the three of us do all the work and only end up with 25%?
13698,Sheldon,Well as a male I have an evolutionary drive to perpetuate my DNA. Restricting myself to a single partner is against my nature.
13699,Howard,What was all that about?
13700,Leonard,Okay so Kripke played a joke on you.
13701,Leonard,Yeah?
13702,Leonard,Oh. Okay. A little musical foreplay. Terrific.
13703,Sheldon,I’m being petty? You know Barry and I have a professional rivalry. You heard him he told me to suck eggs. If we were friends he would have suggested I suck something more pleasant. Why are you laughing? Did you learn something?
13704,Penny,Okay look can we just please forget about all this extra stuff and can you just tell me what Leonard does?
13705,Howard,I can’t do anything right for you can I?
13706,Sheldon,We don’t know. And if you don’t answer the phone we can’t know.
13708,Sheldon,And I with you. Question are you seeking a romantic relationship with me?
13709,Leonard,She doesn’t mean it. She’s just being nice.
13710,Raj,Hey guys.
13711,Leonard,Well you were right tears.
13712,Sheldon,Correct.
13713,Leonard,Actually I was…
13714,Sheldon,Which one picks last?
13715,Penny,Wine credit card and late night television are a bad combination.
13716,Raj,Thank you. Thanks thanks. I’m sorry. I can’t do this. My my ex-girlfriend e-mailed me and I’m seeing her Saturday And I’m glad you like it it’s from J. Crew.
13717,Raj,How do you know what the exact temperature of the room is?
13718,Leonard,Where are you going? You just walk away in the middle of an argument?!
13719,Sheldon,All right. I’ll take the first watch and wake you at 0400.
13720,Howard,Be afraid of Penny nice very crafty.
13721,Leonard,Oh…!
13722,Raj,Penny?
13723,Howard,No. Is he still mad about the supercollider?
13724,Raj,We’re not kicking him out. Stuart and I have become good friends.
13725,Sheldon,And she wonders why she’s constantly undertipped.
13726,Sheldon,Just do it.
13727,Penny,120?
13728,Penny,Oh damn.
13729,Leonard,So call her.
13730,Leonard,I don’t know what he’s putting on those cards but you are smarter than ever.
13731,Howard,Well my feelings were real when he was about to die.
13732,Penny,Um what is that scent you’re wearing? It smells great.
13733,Leonard,Come on.
13734,Howard,Yes Emily. Whatever. Where’s Sheldon?
13735,Sheldon,A breakup would imply she was my girlfriend. She was a girl who was my friend who is now a girl who is not my friend.
13736,Leonard,No let her go.
13737,Howard,Uh can I just say I’ve missed all of us hanging out together.
13738,Leonard,Well hey okay. Let me make this up to you. Sometimes I keep an online journal. I want you to read something that I wrote.
13739,Penny,Oh it was fine.
13740,Leonard,Why do I feel like I’m the one that just got the prostate exam?
13741,Penny,Okay whatever.
13742,Penny,I’m having a tea party. What do you think’s going on? I think I might have the flu. Or the plague.
13743,Howard,Where does he poop?
13744,Leonard,No good Sheldon doesn’t float.
13745,Raj,It’s just a phone.
13746,Howard,Yeah it’s also a wand.
13747,Sheldon,Ah. So it is. I guess we both share blame on this one.
13748,Penny,Mm. So why don’t they just get more drywall?
13749,Penny,It wasn’t me. But she was also an actress and we were both up for the same part in a toothpaste commercial. She got it. Look I was so jealous. But instead of ripping out her fake blonde hair…
13750,Sheldon,Because the print they’re showing on Friday has an additional 21 seconds of previously unseen footage.
13751,Leonard,I’m not a big fan of musicals but I love that show.
13752,Penny,Yes Leonard I am insecure. Happy?
13753,Penny,Because you wouldn’t shut up about it. When I called him he had nothing to do so I just thought it would…
13754,Sheldon,Are we all up to date on our yellow fever inoculations?
13755,Leonard,Probably. What’s your point?
13756,Sheldon,Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case. Leonard did it.
13757,Sheldon,I was hesitant the first time I tried it but I experienced an unanticipated and remarkable release of endorphins. It’s quite satisfying.
13758,Sheldon,Enjoy the accolades now Wil Wheaton but like your time on Star Trek Next Generation your smug self-satisfaction will be short-lived.
13759,Raj,I am Shiva the destroyer I will have the woman!
13760,Sheldon,Yeah I have to say I thought the toilet humour would get less funny with repetition. Apparently there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop. 
13761,Penny,Wait is anything gonna jump out of that.
13762,Howard,Yeah. Like when you took Sheldon to Texas and showed him all around NASA you didn’t even think to ask me and Leonard.
13763,Howard,Okay big buddy. See you tonight guys. 
13764,Raj,Eleven.
13765,Sheldon,Well look at that even when I’m causing problems I make the world a better place. Hey next why don’t we tackle your penchant for whining and Penny’s love of the ol’ glug-glug?
13766,Sheldon,I’ve made a horrible mistake.
13767,Sheldon,Yeah but I do.
13768,Sheldon,Oh Leonard’s mad at me so I’m making him lemon bars.
13769,Leonard,It’s kind of a fashionable look these days.
13770,Sheldon,I call for a vote of no confidence and an immediate change in leadership.
13771,Raj,Oh. Hang on. You got a you got a little something. Ah.
13772,Sheldon,Amy’s mad at me and I’m not clear why.
13773,Leonard,Sorry somebody’s sitting there.
13774,Sheldon,Wash those bea… Oh I get it a little hazing for the new fella. Yeah I’d better keep and eye out for what shoe polish on the microscope or mad cow disease in my grilled cheese sandwich?
13775,Penny,Hey you do your experiments I do mine.
13776,Leonard,Are we done with this?
13777,Sheldon,He does that to me too. Why do we put up with it?
13778,Leonard,No she was pretty clear about wanting to keep her options open.
13779,Leonard,It’s cool. Go back to Kevin.
13780,Raj,Incredible. You managed to screw up the screw-up.
13781,Sheldon,I see. Well I think I’ll be going.
13782,Sheldon,I know I was there.
13783,Leonard,You mean where they were advanced enough to invent an interstellar warp drive but a black lady still answered the space phone?
13784,Raj,Look I get it but before we pass up on an incredible opportunity I was thinking about when Howard was training to go to space they put him in a simulated environment.
13785,Sheldon,I have an alternate proposal.
13786,Raj,I don’t know. They’re dressed very stylishly. They’re probably stuck-up. This is ridiculous. The next person that walks by no matter who it is they’re the one. We’re gonna die here.
13787,Sheldon,…..
13788,Sheldon,I’m here to return your belongings. That’s what people who’ve broken up do.
13789,Sheldon,No that would be incongruous I was going to lower the whole voice to a more pleasing register.
13790,Howard,Oh okay. Got it.
13791,Leonard,Um let me just have some coffee first and then I’ll have the strength to tell you how much I won’t be doing that.  Hello?
13792,Sheldon,Okay! At what point did you begin to feel lost?
13793,Penny,No no no no I need you now.
13794,Sheldon,Not challenging? I was humiliating the man. I was thinking of writing a book called A Brief History of the Time I Made Stephen Hawking Cry Like a Little Girl.
13795,Leonard,So if you don’t like Star Wars why are you here?
13797,Howard,But next time we’ll be cat burglars.
13799,Penny,I don’t know like 50 cents. I’m not sure.
13800,Sheldon,Okay I’ve found the perfect solution. We get off the train at the next stop in Oxnard. We then take the 113 train back to Union Station. We take a cab back to the apartment get my flash drive and then race to San Luis Obispo where assuming the lights are with us and minimal traffic we’ll meet the train.
13801,Leonard,On Earth? In our lives? That that that we’re living?
13802,Leonard,What speech?
13803,Sheldon,Is that really what you want to talk about Leonard?
13804,Howard,Whatever. It would have been nice to hear it from you.
13805,Howard,Better?
13806,Raj,He lied about the cream cheese. He ate the whole thing. I saw him.
13807,Sheldon,He does on Wednesdays.
13808,Raj,They are too.
13809,Penny,Sheldon she wanted to show you off to her family and you stood her up okay? Look at this adorable smushy face. Smush smush smush smush.
13810,Howard,Uh Xbox One.
13811,Howard,I told you she exists.
13812,Raj,Technically it would only be rebound if he and Penny had actually engaged in physical intimacy.
13813,Raj,I’m worried about the New Horizons space probe.
13814,Howard,So should we go talk to him?
13815,Raj,That cannot be true.
13816,Howard,One second. Okay I think we’re close. How do you feel about a mini-fridge in my room?
13817,Leonard,Nothing flamed out. We don’t have to have sex every night you know.
13818,Penny,Nope.
13819,Sheldon,That’s not fair. I got stuck behind a tree.
13820,Sheldon,Well I wish I could.
13821,Raj,Hey hey do you hear yourselves? Let’s just you know all calm down and take a step back.
13822,Leonard,I’ll get my chisel.
13823,Sheldon, That’s right good job. Hello. Uh you wanted to see me?
13824,Howard,Okay we’ve got fajitas with all the fixins so you make your own.
13825,Sheldon,Yes. Yes. My brain is better than everybody’s.
13826,Sheldon,And good-bye to you sir. He’ll be back.
13827,Sheldon,What did he say?
13828,Leonard,Thank you. Seriously please don’t make me go.
13829,Leonard,No. Do you?
13830,Penny,Oh it’s good. I just wish Leonard would work up the courage to tell Sheldon he’s moving in here.
13832,Leonard,Why did I pee before I decided to move in here?
13833,Penny,Hey you look great. Good for you Priya. I could never get that stupid hoodie off him when we were… well you look great.
13834,Sheldon,My mom bought me those pants.
13835,Howard,Please. You’re looking at Facebook to find out how their date went.
13836,Raj,There’s a 200-watt uninterruptible backup power supply.
13837,Sheldon,Chat? We don’t chat. At least not offline.
13838,Howard,Oh please.When it comes to Terminators you’ve got a better shot of scoring with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
13839,Penny,Wait. Get up get up!  Swear you won’t tell Sheldon what happened!
13840,Leonard,Oh b-be careful. Give him some line. Okay now reel him in.
13841,Leonard,Okay he’s in the bathroom let’s go.
13842,Sheldon,Oh no.
13843,Leonard,It can’t be four revolutions it’s got to be seven.
13844,Sheldon,Look at him caring about what’s wrong with me. That is some top-shelf empathy. Hey well we should start a club.
13845,Leonard,Our babies will be smart and beautiful.
13846,Penny,Um I have a question.
13847,Leonard,And it wasn’t when we were driving like this?
13848,Sheldon,And divide it how I’m telling you we cannot do this without Wolowitz.
13849,Penny,Doc you’ve got to see what you’re doing is is a little creepy.
13850,Penny,Pasadena city college?
13851,Leonard,Yeah this morning he used a stick of butter as deodorant.
13852,Leonard,It’s a… 
13853,Leonard,Uh yeah yeah sure I guess.
13854,Sheldon,Well since you’re here I’d like to get your opinion on something. In honour of Black History Month I portrayed George Washington Carver in a loving tribute that my roommate called wildly racist. What do you think?  Hi. My name is George.
13855,Raj,Bernadette please tell your boyfriend to cool it with the cow jokes.
13856,Howard,Ever since I was a little boy my father wanted me to be a gynaecologist like him. How can I be a gynaecologist I can barely look a woman in the eye. You know what I’m not going to let my parents control my future any longer it’s time for a showdown. Somebody give me a computer with a webcam.
13857,Sheldon,Well then may I suggest you get a very long stick and play panty pinata.
13858,Sheldon,Oh thank you. I wasn’t sure I was gonna to make it. But my mother gave me some ice chips my sister told me to breathe and I just thought to myself Sheldon if you can make it through the Green Lantern movie you can make it through this.
13859,Howard,If you want we could tell you.
13860,Leonard,Thank you. Why is a world-renowned scientist staying in our apartment instead of a hotel?
13861,Sheldon,You may have gone to Cambridge but I’m an honorary graduate of Starfleet academy.
13862,Penny,Oh-oh. I just remembered where the emergency key is.
13863,Leonard,It’s just such a big decision. I don’t want to have any regrets.
13864,Sheldon,Nothing. It’s not suspicious that I’m fixating. It’s consistent with my personality.
13866,Raj,No no no I’m going to have a me day. First I’m going to go to one of those spas in Koreatown take a steam and get a massage. Then I’m going to stop at a pet store and get licked by puppies.
13867,Leonard,I’m having dinner with Priya at Raj’s. I think Howard’s going to be there. You want to join us?
13868,Sheldon,Astro means star.
13869,Leonard,Just roll the dice.
13870,Penny,The new neighbours are weird.
13871,Sheldon,Well it’s not that late. You could still go out and look for number 32. Good night.
13872,Penny,So wait if my career took me somewhere else you might not go?
13873,Penny,I just eat the little crispy ones you don’t like.
13874,Leonard,Yes. Thank you.
13875,Raj,It’s a lease.
13876,Leonard,Szechuan Palace closed two years ago.
13877,Howard,I’d like that. This is turning out to be a perfect Saturday.
13878,Leonard,How is super-aging any different than like doing crossword puzzles?
13879,Sheldon,Penny for the thousandth time I’m saving myself for someone special. Perhaps a cute bespectacled neuroscientist with hair the color of mud.
13880,Sheldon,Hold on. Is it back pay or is it a gift?
13881,Leonard,That’s actually good. Why didn’t I think of that?
13882,Raj,Just leave! Okay now. This is the way it’s supposed to be. Men together fighting the forces of evil.
13883,Leonard,You know let’s just come up with something new.
13884,Howard,That’s great. I’m broken too.
13885,Raj,Oh no it’s okay. I just found a wobble.
13886,Sheldon,Check.
13887,Leonard,Yeah sure.
13888,Sheldon,Okay.
13889,Sheldon,I am. You know and in an effort to reduce awkwardness as we learn how to function as friends I printed out a list of safe topics for polite conversation.
13890,Howard,You’re blowing this for me!
13891,Howard,Okay. Penny two of the brightest stars in the night sky are Altair and Vega. And it is said they were deeply in love but forever separated by the celestial river of the Milky Way.
13892,Howard,We’re just keeping it casual.
13893,Leonard,What information?
13894,Howard,Okay Sheldon. Yeah I’m putting you in charge of my finances. I will not spend another penny that you don’t authorize.
13895,Penny,You know what? I missed you too.
13896,Sheldon,I know. When will this nightmare end?
13897,Raj,Just to help her with her screenplay.
13898,Penny,What never?
13899,Penny,No I think we’re just gonna have a quiet weekend at home.
13900,Leonard,I wear dorky T-shirts and glasses.
13901,Raj,I uh I’m sorry to put you through that.
13902,Sheldon,Yeah and Leonard’s mother’s already here.
13903,Sheldon,One at a time.  What was that?
13904,Raj,Well that’s that. The room’s compromised. They’ll have to change all the filters probably shut it down for weeks.
13905,Penny,Okay you know what’s not romantic? Rubbing it in someone’s face.
13906,Penny,Thanks! I mean the e-mail doesn’t bother me as much as the vacation pictures of him in a bathing suit.
13907,Penny,Woah Leonard and Priya are living together? That’s big.
13908,Leonard,He was so busy figuring out how many parts per million of urine we’d be floating around in he didn’t even question it.
13909,Howard,Okay great you can tell him you hate him. Sign here.
13910,Sheldon,It’s actually 01100111.
13911,Sheldon,Hold on I believe that social convention dictate you not arrive empty-Handed. Would you like to bring some Cylon toast?
13912,Leonard,For all those girls out there looking for the Indian Monopoly man?
13914,Leonard,Sheldon.
13915,Penny,Okay your problem is you’re trying to do this all by yourself.
13916,Sheldon,Raj don’t dangle false hope in front of Leonard like that.
13917,Sheldon,You guys are aroused right?
13918,Howard,But if we were part of the team that confirmed string theory we could drink for free in any bar in any college town with a university that has a strong science program.
13919,Penny,Amy this is crazy. You have nothing to be suspicious about.
13920,Howard,Is the trick making him disappear? Sure let’s see it.
13921,Raj,You’re so full of it.
13922,Penny,Okay where is this coming from?
13923,Howard,Where have you been?
13924,Sheldon,And kind of delicious. I wonder how many licks it would take to get to the centre of me.
13925,Penny,You know how about we buy you this robot and then we all go home?
13926,Raj,Okay every other month.
13927,Penny,Yep!
13928,Howard,Well not now.
13929,Leonard,Hey buddy why don’t we go for a walk so you can calm down.
13930,Raj,Hang on. No offence to her father but he’s not an MIT trained engineer. Thinking and building is what you do.
13931,Penny,Wow there’s a Denny’s in Vegas you can actually get married in.
13932,Leonard,Sheldon that computer is used for National defence. Hacking into it is a Federal crime.
13933,Penny,What the hell?
13934,Raj,Do you know what he’s talking about?
13935,Raj,It it doesn’t matter. Howard has a girlfriend.
13936,Sheldon,Subliminal messaging. I’m going to make you want to pee. Dripping faucets. Leaky gutter. Peeing.
13937,Penny,So is this your first time dating a scientist? ‘Cause I’m thinking of starting a support group.
13938,Sheldon,Please Leonard stop trying to horn in on my new friends.
13939,Penny,I don’t wanna.
13940,Leonard,Yeah me too. I can’t make up my mind.
13941,Penny,Okay stop that. No more preschool talk. Tonight is about having fun.
13942,Howard,You know I thought cleaning out a dead professor’s office was gonna just be boring but then I found his dentures and realized it’s also gross.
13943,Penny,Do you have a problem with Justin staying with me?
13944,Sheldon,Well you can’t be sure of that. What if the helium dealer rats us out? What if Kripke asks where we got it? What if the university checks my family tree and finds out I don’t have an Uncle Harvey?
13945,Sheldon,Yes.
13946,Howard,Well I I thought about…
13947,Sheldon,It might also interest you to know that Wil Wheaton currently ranks sixth on my all-time enemies list right between director Joel Schumacher who nearly destroyed the Batman movie franchise and Billy Sparks who lived down the street from me and put dog poop on the handles of my bicycle.
13948,Sheldon,You’ve asked me to lie on your behalf and as you know I am deeply uncomfortable with impromptu dishonest so I’ve provided you with an iron clad alibi. You couldn’t have spent last night with Priya because you were with another woman.
13949,Howard,Also since the time machine doesn’t move in space you’ll end up in 1876 Pasadena.
13950,Leonard,Yeah well it’s in our contract to serve on a university committee. And frankly this is one I believe in. Okay here we go. Encouraging more women to pursue a career in the sciences.
13951,Howard,Oh I call dibs on the Golden Age Flash.
13952,Raj,And I’m just hearing about this now?
13953,Sheldon,Good. Good.
13954,Penny,You should go ’cause you want to go not because you have to.
13955,Sheldon,No no. I was just sitting at home thinking about how it might be nice to catch up with my ninth favourite person.
13956,Howard,I was really hoping to see a cattle drive.
13957,Penny,Come on Leonard this is just a PR stunt.
13958,Penny,I don’t understand.
13959,Raj,Well that’s what the bullies at Bruce Lee’s high school thought. And then bam. Karate.
13960,Leonard,Is somebody working on that?
13961,Leonard,There perfect.
13962,Sheldon,No.
13963,Sheldon,Did you hear that? A mop. I have two PhDs yet somehow I’m the janitor of my sister’s birth canal.
13964,Penny,I know. Watching your boyfriend run around with a broomstick between his legs isn’t something you forget.
13965,Leonard,Your problem.
13966,Penny,If I was at a train station and one train could take me to my current job and the other train could take me to an audition for a movie which train should I get on?
13967,Sheldon,Oh. Thank you.
13968,Penny,Now just read your mother’s line.
13969,Penny,Hello Sheldon.
13970,Leonard,Good afternoon Penny so hi hey. Uh… I was wondering if you had plans for dinner.
13971,Leonard,Sheldon’s assistant asked me on a date last night.
13972,Howard,He was a lot more fun when he had no hope.
13973,Sheldon,You know it’s a shame all that work she’s doing to get sober only to be torn apart and eaten alive.
13974,Penny,Oh my God it’s about her and Sheldon.
13975,Raj,Oh yeah. The guy who lives next to me is always like I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony. But wait until I tell him I’ve got a time machine on my balcony. Stuff that in your speedos Jacuzzi Bob!
13976,Raj,I don’t think that’s what you want at all.
13977,Sheldon,Well off the top of my head I’d have to go with Excalibur. It gives you the right to rule England.
13978,Penny,Oh come on really? 
13979,Howard,Tag. You’re it. 
13980,Sheldon,You’ll appreciate this. Leonard has some ridiculous notion that you’re mad at me. Tell him you’re not mad at me. Go ahead set him straight.
13981,Leonard,Not on Blu-ray. Only twice on Blu-ray.
13982,Leonard,No-one’s going to ask if I spent the night with Raj’s sister.
13983,Raj,I don’t want to say because I don’t know how much it is.
13984,Howard,Hey do you think the elastic woman in The Incredibles needs to use birth control or can she just be a diaphragm?
13985,Leonard,No.
13986,Penny,Why are you yelling at me?
13987,Sheldon,Well there’s actually big news on the Amy front. She’s been studying the neurobiology of addiction in lower animals. She is this close to getting a starfish hooked on cocaine.
13988,Howard,I don’t know but I’d like to get lost in her Bermuda Triangle.
13989,Raj,And what does forty-three mean?
13991,Leonard,Did you tell them that you’re holding your convention at a Marie Callender’s and that every panellist gets a free slice of pie?
13992,Leonard,What’s wrong with your face?
13993,Sheldon,But if we all go back to the same point in time Bell’s lab is going to get very crowded he’ll know something’s up.
13994,Penny,Not with money. Read.
13995,Penny,Oh I heard him interviewed on the radio. You know when they told him he won he didn’t believe it but then he did believe it. It was so funny.
13996,Leonard,I just wanted to make her work for it.
13997,Penny,Okay I found the box. Now what?
13998,Leonard,Your father’s a gynaecologist.
13999,Sheldon,I know. And it wasn’t easy. Do you have any idea what it’s like to wait for years and never know if you’re going to finally get satisfaction?
14000,Leonard,If you’re not happy why don’t you just let Kripke have the office?
14001,Leonard,Buddy I know me moving in with Penny feels like a big change but it’s not.
14002,Penny,I got a brand-new bikini so drinks at the pool are on these.
14003,Raj,What would you name him?
14004,Penny,You did make that up right?
14005,Raj,Maybe. I I don’t know.It’s late I should I should go. Look I do get what you’re saying. Instead of desperately clinging to any woman who will go out with me I need to work on my fear of being alone.
14006,Penny,Yeah you probably had it coming.
14007,Penny,What?
14008,Sheldon,Fairy God Monster I win. Your desperate need for friendship makes you weak.
14009,Leonard,Oh God did you watch Bridget Jones again?
14010,Leonard,Oh come on. It’s not boring at all. She’s currently helping set up a secondary derivative market which would allow overseas car firms to hedge their investments against potential advancements in battery technology. Hmm?
14011,Sheldon,Wait. Is this really worth it? We’ve lived together for years with nary an argument.
14012,Penny,What? You’re okay with an experiment where you have to answer awkward questions about your innermost feelings?
14013,Penny,Now Sheldon’s popular? What is happening?
14014,Leonard,Oh yeah. No we were just going.
14015,Raj,No.
14016,Sheldon,No no Princess Punchali from The Monkey and the Princess.
14017,Sheldon,Well I just asked her if I should start watching the new Flash TV series.
14018,Howard,You’re you’re a good friend for trying to help but I’ve made my choice.
14019,Penny,Come on they would be so cute on me and ah they go great with this sweater!
14020,Penny,Oh. Okay. Oh. Oh. Hey.
14021,Sheldon,I would advise the three of you that resistance is futile. I have endless patience. I once spent two-and-a-half hours on hold with Hewlett-Packard customer service just to complain about their customer service.
14022,Sheldon,That’s how you do it Wolowitz. Now you see why he’s famous and you’re not.
14023,Penny,Down the road? Sheldon she wanted to share a toothbrush holder with you and now you’re at an ice cream parlour trying to pick up women.
14024,Sheldon,Oh really? Because I remember you saying that this trip was going to be something we could both enjoy. Did you mean that or were you just trying to trick me?
14025,Penny,You must be Leonard’s mother.
14026,Penny,I know me too. But it will be fun to have a prom without all the drama.
14027,Leonard,Well I don’t know. It’s a bachelor party. There could be strippers. Wouldn’t that make you a little jealous?
14028,Penny,I can see.
14029,Raj,I thought someone looked brighter and tighter.
14030,Sheldon,Well then what took you so long?
14031,Penny,All right come on come on. Put some real emotion into it. Blah-blah blah blah vast and troubled galaxy. Go.
14032,Leonard,My leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.
14033,Sheldon,But I don’t want to go to bed.
14034,Penny,It’s a non-optional social convention.
14035,Penny,Seriously? You went first after only two weeks? That’s bold.
14036,Leonard,What is it?
14037,Raj,With your sales record you have nothing to worry about.
14038,Raj,Yoo-hoo! Over here!
14039,Sheldon,It’s football nomenclature for when a quarterback is tackled behind the line of scrimmage.
14040,Raj,What?
14041,Sheldon,You can’t live here.
14042,Howard,Oh yes. Oh okay. Uh Good night. I don’t know maybe it’s the fumes from the urinal cakes but I feel like something is happening between us.
14043,Leonard,Sheldon this is not a big deal. It’s a little white lie everyone does it.
14044,Leonard,And you?
14045,Penny,He’s there.
14046,Sheldon,Yes and be sure and put on the emergency brake. Really makes these things tough to budge.
14047,Leonard,Just say the but thing about Doug and then I’ll get her back.
14048,Penny,Okay I was just checking.
14049,Howard,May I ask what this is about?
14050,Penny,No. She’s busy. You call Howard.
14051,Raj,Here we go. Lock up your daughters! We’re going to hit it and quit it.
14052,Penny,This is so sweet. You never cook for me.
14053,Sheldon,No.
14054,Sheldon,What took you so long?
14055,Sheldon,Leonard do you understand this?
14056,Leonard,Well how did you know about it?
14057,Penny,No no it’s…
14058,Leonard,What are we doing?
14059,Leonard,Well Vegas but…
14060,Penny,Just going to skip over that insult.
14061,Leonard,You got one for good luck.  I’ll get it.
14062,Leonard,Look I need to get to the laser lab you’re just going to have to find someone else to take you home.
14063,Howard,Oh my God you are such a mama’s boy.
14064,Penny,Yeah uh I really don’t think I do.
14065,Sheldon,Look look here I am standing next to the incubator. Uh here is a microscopic view of the cells.
14066,Raj,Why not?
14067,Leonard,Stephen Hawking liked our paper. Said the premise is intriguing.
14068,Penny,Really? They’re going to make a robot that spits on your hamburger?
14069,Penny,Yeah he is pretty stupid.
14070,Sheldon,You know I don’t want to tell you how to do your job but when a mouse completes a maze it gets a food pellet.
14071,Penny,Oh and the fairy tale continues.
14072,Sheldon,Well don’t worry. He went to MIT. He can solve any problem as long as it doesn’t originate in a Russian man’s colon.
14073,Penny,Fine.
14074,Penny,Hi. I’m Penny. This is my friend Sheldon.
14075,Raj,Hey Claire. Good you’re here. Guys this is my friend Claire. We’re casually dating and there’s no need for any further questions about it.
14076,Sheldon,He’s a Hobbit! I’ve got your back.
14077,Howard,The best one I ever had!
14078,Raj,I’m glad that men are wearing hats again. They’re so distinguished.
14079,Sheldon,Well you should. 50% of marriages end in divorce but 100% of make your own sundae bars end in happiness.
14080,Leonard,Thanks.
14081,Leonard,Penny’s working tonight I’m in.
14082,Raj,Stay I’ll get her.
14083,Howard,I was wrong. This is worse.
14084,Leonard,Lobsters overnight?
14085,Howard,Okay every other month.
14086,Sheldon,Get out!
14087,Leonard,In what universe?
14089,Leonard,Otherwise we’d love to.
14090,Raj,It’s Koothrappali. I have to tinkle.
14091,Howard,Don’t worry. Everything I have I share with her. Including my friend Leon…
14092,Penny,Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.
14093,Sheldon,I don’t want to go home.
14094,Sheldon,Because when I speak at a regular volume no one seems to believe me that I’ve put this Amy nonsense behind me.
14095,Sheldon,Odd President Seibert posed the exact same question.
14096,Sheldon,Gentlemen I have figured out the perfect way for you to irritate me. I’d like you to be my intellectual sparring partners. From now on when I make an assertion I need you to challenge it.
14097,Leonard,Better than watching a guy in a fur cloak ride a girl’s bike? Nope.
14098,Howard,Hey Stuart I see you’re getting ready for your Halloween party.
14099,Sheldon,I don’t know if you’ve been following the news Leonard but there have been some terrific advancements in the field of torture.
14100,Leonard,Howard Raj and I just had a team meeting.
14101,Sheldon,Indeed. I was the world’s smartest caterpillar. And then after pupating in our nation’s railway system I’ve burst forth as the world’s smartest butterfly.
14102,Leonard,Well that is the grown-up thing.
14103,Sheldon,Oh.
14104,Raj,Yeah you keep setting me up for failure.
14105,Penny,What? You can’t fire me. I’m the star. I’m the girl that goes bananas. It says so on the poster.
14106,Sheldon,Of course I do. The essence of the custom is that I now have to go out and purchase for you a gift of commensurate value and representing the same perceived level of friendship as that represented by the gift you’ve given me. It’s no wonder suicide rates skyrocket this time of year.
14107,Penny,Like what?
14108,Sheldon,Given this situation I have no choice but to withdraw my previous objections to your ill considered relationship with Leonard.
14109,Sheldon,I’m sorry but I’m not going to watch the Clone Wars TV series until I’ve seen the Clone Wars movie. I prefer to let George Lucas disappoint me in the order he intended.
14110,Raj,Mm. Last night I had a dream we got so rich from the app you and I bought matching side-by-side mansions. But there was a secret tunnel connecting your front yard to my back yard. What do you think that means?
14111,Leonard,Yeah I really didn’t think this through.
14112,Sheldon,Yes but not of the same species.
14113,Leonard,Well there was a lot at stake.
14114,Sheldon,Um uh in a hundred years you’ll both be dead and it won’t matter?
14115,Leonard,Well we’re always the good guys. In D&D we’re lawful good in City Of Heroes we’re the heroes in Grand Theft Auto we pay the prostitutes promptly and never hit them with a bat.
14116,Leonard,Alright I’ll be right back.
14117,Leonard,Well with Wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend Christie
14118,Penny,Really? The only adult?
14119,Leonard,Okay so it’s four seventy-five for a signed black-and-white and nine ninety-five for a colour.
14120,Leonard,You realize if the military declares our research classified they can take the whole thing away from us.
14121,Sheldon,He does want that. Does a man with my intellectual gifts play paintball on weekends?
14122,Penny,What window?
14123,Sheldon,Yeah I used to be uncomfortable around people but then I learned a trick. I pretend everyone I meet is a beloved character from Star Trek.
14124,Penny,All right who’s ready for another beer?
14125,Penny,“Time travel? I don’t understand” said Amelia. Cooper stared at her. ‘Which word don’t you understand time or travel?”
14126,Leonard,You know what? I’ve gone 12 times. Maybe I’ll sit out this year too.
14127,Leonard,I was thinking here with you.
14128,Sheldon,Howard please I’m begging you.
14129,Howard,Okay now you’re messing with me.
14130,Penny,I feel terrible.
14131,Penny,Okay why don’t you just tell him you made a mistake?
14132,Howard,She’s very real.
14133,Leonard,Sheldon you’re always saying how much smarter you are than me. Spend five seconds and come up with one idea on how to get more women into science.
14134,Leonard,Just explaining the theory of relativity. Twice.
14135,Penny,Okay. Uncomfortable silence it is. Hey Sheldon have you told Amy what it was like for you growing up in Texas?
14136,Leonard,All right. He “has” a “girlfriend.”
14137,Sheldon,Well no-one’s going to run a DNA test on it Leonard honestly you over-think everything.
14138,Sheldon,There was something wrong with that detergent. That was way too bubbly.
14139,Leonard,It’s a little thing but you really do miss it.
14140,Howard,No. People just keep kicking me out everywhere I go.
14141,Sheldon,Luckily for you this is not a nuclear reactor.
14142,Penny,Okay fine I accept your apology now get out.
14143,Leonard,Are you really admitting defeat?
14144,Leonard,I spent the night in Mexico with Sheldon.
14145,Penny,No I’m making flower barrettes. See? I call them Penny Blossoms. I made one for myself then all the girls at work wanted one. Then I showed some to this lady who runs a shop in Old Town. She sells cards and homemade jewellery. She said she wanted to sell them. I said okay and in one week I made a $156.
14146,Penny,My head what about yours?
14147,Penny,Oh it’s fun.
14148,Sheldon,Research journal entry one. I’m about to embark on one of the great challenges of my scientific career teaching Penny physics. I’m calling it Project Gorilla.
14149,Sheldon,But I think it would be comforting.
14150,Howard,Mrs. Davis I uh I must confess I came here tonight in a futile attempt to pick up some lonely postdoc but instead I got to connect with you at a human level. That’s a much better evening. You’re a lovely person.
14151,Sheldon,No it’s not Amy.
14152,Sheldon,No. They asked me to leave so they could speak privately.
14153,Sheldon,I am perfectly comfortable speaking to small groups. I cannot speak to large crowds.
14154,Sheldon,Point of order. As you’re in distress it would be customary for me to offer you a hot beverage. But I’m a guest in your home so it would be customary for you to offer me a beverage. How do you want to proceed vis-a-vis beverages?
14155,Leonard,No it doesn’t.
14157,Penny,Well I don’t have to pay taxes on this stuff.
14159,Sheldon,You went to the comic book store without me.7
14160,Howard,Stupid Aquaman.
14161,Raj,Oh my goodness look at this room! Champagne! Roses! Oh and little chocolates! This is going to be the best Valentine’s Day ever.
14162,Penny,I could think about you.
14164,Leonard,Uh yes ma’am.
14165,Penny,Ugh. It’s 70 degrees you didn’t need mittens.
14166,Raj,But half-man half-owl could fly…
14167,Penny,Ha-ha. No you’re not.
14168,Sheldon,Fine.  We’ll talk in the morning.
14169,Leonard,No.
14170,Raj,Amy I could use some help.
14171,Penny,Well last time you bought a new shirt was when we were dating.
14172,Leonard,What is it Sheldon? 
14173,Sheldon,Oh. Well a few years ago he did go out with a woman who had a PhD in French Literature.
14174,Howard,Bernie I just forwarded you a list of the top five lactation consultants in Los Angeles. I know my favourite but I’d love to hear what you think.
14175,Sheldon,Okay that right there that equivocation and self-doubt that is not the American spirit. Did Davy Crockett quit at the Alamo? Did Jim Bowie?
14176,Sheldon,Yeah I am indeed. I have decided instead of wallowing in sadness about Amy it is time that I find myself a new female companion.
14177,Leonard,I’m going to talk anyway.
14178,Leonard,The car was a gift it was something you needed. I was happy to help you out.
14179,Sheldon,And apparently Wil Wheaton’s best friend.
14180,Sheldon,The only thing we can do. Watch TV on our phones until the criminals return and bludgeon us to death in our sleep.
14181,Sheldon,I thought she was a highly evolved creature of pure intellect like me. But recent events indicate that she may be a slave to her baser urges. Like you.
14182,Penny,Did you feel guilty?
14183,Howard,Hey can I ask you a favour? Would you mind taking Cinnamon for a walk?
14184,Sheldon,Don’t you dare use science against me. Science is my best friend. Oh good I’m back up to eight.
14185,Penny,So it’s not really like that?
14186,Leonard,What do you want me to do? You started this. Do you want to go over and tell him we’re broken up?
14187,Penny,Of course I haven’t.
14188,Sheldon,Wait. Here who is where?
14189,Raj,Thankyou. And once again my baloney likes girls. Wait-wait. You don’t want to put a bit of that in your mouth without trying my homemade chantilly cream. Yeah okay that time I heard it.
14190,Leonard,He’s calling to ask you a favour. You might be confused because he didn’t use the words Penny Sheldon please or favour.
14191,Leonard,Here you go. Oh you owe me another two dollars. The price of mu-shu pork went up.
14192,Raj,It’s uh been a long time since I’ve seen a girl’s really not her shoulder.
14193,Sheldon,All right why don’t we open it up to Q&A from the audience?
14194,Howard,It wasn’t a pyjama party. It was just a couple of bros hanging out giggling eating cookie dough and watching Princess Bride.
14195,Sheldon,Well she might be interested to know that I have refocused my research from bosonic string theory to heteronic string theory.
14196,Sheldon,No.
14197,Howard,So what should we do today?
14198,Howard,Yeah grow up Howard. God.
14199,Raj,I say you tell Alex your heart belongs to Penny I provide her a shoulder to cry on and then roughly half a year later I give it to her good.
14200,Sheldon,D-d-d! That’s where I sit.
14201,Leonard,Well they say at the end of your life you regret the stuff you didn’t do more than the stuff that you did and I’m pretty sure Alice is the stuff I want to do.
14202,Howard,I think we already have. Thank you guys so much. Let’s see if you fit in my man purse.
14203,Penny,I get that but why is this so hard?
14204,Penny,She needed money. You seem under pressure. Did I not lend you a sufficient amount? Because I can give you more.
14206,Leonard,Hey Leslie.
14207,Sheldon,Okay. Well then uh first things first. Um are you familiar with the Brachistochrone problem?
14208,Penny,Hey do me a favour and take table seven.
14210,Leonard,Did it have a metal toilet next to the bed?
14211,Penny,Sure why?
14212,Sheldon,I heard you ask it over and over. How is it inappropriate for me to ask it once?
14213,Sheldon,Knight to old woman six-and-a-third. Brilliant move. Thank you.  Will the two of you excuse me?
14214,Penny,No. Maybe. I don’t know.
14215,Penny,Oh look. You huh you just you got it all right there. Wow.
14216,Penny,What?
14217,Leonard,Hey.
14218,Raj,Oh my God she’s that Mona? Why can’t you and my sister spend your nights here?
14219,Leonard,Like a river carves a canyon.
14220,Penny,Yeah I probably wouldn’t.
14221,Leonard,I’ve come to peace with my relationship with my parents. That was a big milestone for me.
14222,Sheldon,You’re overestimating the tensile strength of the substructure you’re building.
14223,Sheldon, Ladies?
14224,Penny,Well for Penny it’s dancing night.
14225,Howard,Unbelievable.
14226,Leonard,How did you know you were a giant if everything was to scale?
14227,Leonard,Uh I’ve got some bad news. There’s no cell service in here.
14228,Sheldon,Mine.
14229,Leonard,Hey we could liberate some micro-porous charcoal from the chem lab.
14230,Penny,I don’t really know how to say this.
14231,Sheldon,I’m sorry so eventually zombies are going to attack the rehab facility where Sandra Bullock is?
14232,Leonard,How are we doing?
14233,Howard,Owner father soul mate and if anything happens to her your worst nightmare.
14234,Penny,Okay. Listen the truth is I don’t want him living with me.
14235,Penny,I think he misses his little buddy.
14236,Leonard,We can’t. He was already fixed when I found him at the shelter.
14237,Sheldon,Well I don’t sell my friendship that cheaply.
14238,Penny,You’re right! Yay!
14239,Penny,The notebook isn’t in the bathroom.
14240,Penny,Oh damn it. I told Amy that in the strictest confidence. Boy some people are such blabbermouths. Well whatever I’m sure Bernadette can do better.
14241,Sheldon,Really? He reminded me of a young William Shatner.
14242,Penny,Well I’m his girlfriend of course I’m gonna support him.
14243,Raj,You don’t have to bite my head off.
14244,Howard,How is that a T?
14245,Sheldon,It was. This seemed so elegant at the time but now I realize I was just a simple country boy seduced by a big city theory with variables in all the right places.
14246,Leonard,We’re not living together.
14247,Leonard,The drawbridge is lowering.
14248,Penny,Come on yoga top. Mama needs a new yoga top.
14249,Leonard,I honestly don’t remember.
14250,Leonard,I’ve always been a little confused about this. Why don’t Hindus eat beef?
14251,Howard,No she didn’t.
14252,Penny,Love?
14253,Sheldon,Does Stephen Hawking roll through the quad?
14254,Penny,All right. I’ll go change. Come on in.
14256,Leonard,Right… I didn’t….
14257,Sheldon,Don’t thank me. You earned it.
14258,Raj,I don’t know. I lost track and I missed my exit. So uh so what’s up?
14259,Sheldon,And how do you propose to do that?  Unless you have Gravity on Blu-ray under that skirt I don’t know where you’re going with this.
14260,Howard,I’ve never seen it.
14261,Howard,Also a good plan.
14262,Leonard,Hocus Pocus Pocahontas.
14263,Raj,Okay. You ladies have fun tonight.
14264,Penny,I don’t know what succubus is but it has suck in it so that can’t be good.
14265,Leonard,Come on you’re trying to have sex with your father and I’m okay with that.
14266,Sheldon,I would suggest something to the effect of singing is neither an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you and if you disagree I’d recommend you have a CAT scan to look for a tumour pressing on the cognitive processing centre of your brain.
14267,Raj,Well didn’t think this is where my life would be.
14268,Raj,We have to tell him.
14269,Sheldon,That’s a good question.  Amy and Bernadette. Why did you lie to us?
14270,Howard,I don’t know where your pants are but we did find your underwear in a pot on the stove.
14271,Penny,All right well that doesn’t prove anything.
14272,Penny,Okay I’m sorry. Did we get off on the wrong foot? Because since the other night I kind of feel like you might have a problem with me.
14273,Penny,Yeah. And who knows how Amy will react.
14274,Sheldon,And then you put it back compromising the integrity of all the other onion rings.
14275,Sheldon,Yeah. I’m afraid so. Childbirth looming coitus? This is a banner night for female genitals.
14276,Howard,Oh it all comes down to this.
14277,Sheldon,Earlier today I invited Professor Stephen Hawking to join me in the popular online game Words with Friends. Moments ago he accepted my request. Do you understand what that means?
14278,Leonard,I’m sorry are you suggesting that if we let Penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism?
14279,Leonard,What happened?
14280,Sheldon,Oh oh oh I have a reason. It could be because you said yes to marrying Zack but every time Leonard’s proposed he’s gotten a resounding no. Yeah that’s just off the top of my head.
14281,Sheldon,That is the most sickeningly sweet thing I have ever experienced. And I am sipping Kool-Aid through a Red Vine.
14282,Sheldon,Individual relish packets?
14283,Leonard,That’s because we are.
14284,Sheldon,I’ve heard that before but then the next thing you know I’m hiding in my bedroom blaring a Richard Feinman lecture while my mom is shouting that Jesus would forgive her if she put ground glass in my dad’s meatloaf and my dad’s on the roof skeet-shooting her Franklin Mint collectible plates.
14285,Sheldon,You’re a carrier. All these people here are doomed. You’re doomed!
14287,Raj,Me either.
14288,Howard,Sure you remember. You went to the bar and made a fool of yourself trying to pick up strange women.
14289,Leonard,Elizabeth? What’s going on?
14290,Leonard,O-o-o-oh! .
14291,Leonard,Okay but now there’s this Swedish team that read our paper and they’re trying to beat us to our own discovery. We really need this helium.
14292,Raj,You can’t leave. You’re a suspect in the mysterious murder of Stuart Bloom.
14293,Penny,If you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone what would you most regret not having told someone?
14294,Raj,Dude that’s my sister you’re talking about.
14295,Sheldon,Drag out our mattress and put it over here then go across the hall get their mattress and put it over here. But before you do any of that scratch my nose.
14296,Leonard,I figured that out.
14297,Leonard,Well it’s not across the hall.
14298,Sheldon,Because I’m trying to decide between getting an Xbox One or a PS4. Oh pee why’d I say that?
14299,Penny,Sheldon Cooper?
14300,Howard,Well uh as your friend you might like to know that um we didn’t have sex in the conventional sense.
14301,Sheldon,Aren’t you just made of sugar.
14302,Raj,Next time take your own advice.
14303,Howard,I’m just saying maybe if you people cut back on the beer you could get out of the bathroom and satisfy your women without pharmaceutical help.
14304,Howard,We haven’t settled on anything yet.
14305,Penny,Great.
14306,Howard,I don’t know. How do you want to start?
14307,Leonard,You? Sure. Bring as many as you want.
14308,Raj,Do you want my help or not?
14309,Sheldon,All right let’s assume ad argumentum that in this case Leonard is wrong.
14310,Sheldon,Well good Lord no have you seen Jaws?
14311,Sheldon,Earlier I came here to surprise you. I looked in the window and I saw you with a man.
14312,Penny,Do you understand how creepy this is.
14313,Howard,No it’s time to put on some R. Kelly and suck face.
14314,Howard,Cool. All right friend.
14315,Howard,What kind of superhero says dibs on the red tights dibs on the red tights.
14316,Raj,Oh yeah she’s got puddles in all the right places.
14317,Leonard,Mm you watched The Bachelor a lot.
14318,Penny,Okay honey I have a lot to figure out and until I do you are not to say a word to Leonard. Do you understand?
14319,Sheldon,What are you talking about?
14320,Raj,Okay so it’s a it’s a David and Goliath story. It’s about man against God. It’s called Hammer and Whip The Untold Story of Thor versus Indiana Jones.
14321,Sheldon,And you couldn’t put it out?
14322,Sheldon,Good night. I’m sorry. This is really important.
14323,Sheldon,My equations someone’s tampered with my equations.
14324,Raj,I say uh how about one two three go?
14325,Penny,Sheldon doesn’t work here.
14326,Penny,Thanks pal.
14327,Penny,Mmm you clearly haven’t been with me at Mardi Gras.
14328,Sheldon,Excuse me I paid someone to wait in line for me and then when I arrived he left so what you saw my good woman was swapsies not cutsies. Oh no no no no wait I ask you all again a show of hands. Who here takes issue… well stop moving. he’s gonna get in.
14329,Howard,Well I don’t mind. Oh you want go to the mall and look at baby stuff?
14330,Penny,He can take care of himself. Look we went over stranger danger and gave him that whistle.
14333,Leonard,Say can’t talk right now hanging with my boyfriend. England sucks you suck USA number one.
14334,Howard,Dude I’m an astrophysicist. If there were solar flares I’d be all up in it.
14335,Sheldon,I don’t know. I am really aggravated.
14336,Penny,Oh.  Oh that’s the pizza.
14337,Penny,Son of a bitch.
14338,Penny,I know how you feel. I miss Leonard too.
14339,Leonard,Well you have to put in a credit card number but it’s fun.
14340,Sheldon,Very well. Prepare for a long night of deceit.
14341,Sheldon,Not lima beans carbon atoms.
14342,Leonard,I don’t even understand why you’re with someone like me. Why would I want to be with someone like me?
14343,Sheldon,Boy Taylor was right haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate.
14344,Leonard,I’m Leonard this is Sheldon.
14345,Sheldon,Okay one of us is going to have to stop putting up Spock.
14346,Sheldon,I’m trying.
14347,Penny,Okay. Listen Mom I know you’re nervous but I promise you no one is gonna judge you or this family.
14348,Leonard,I’m just saying you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.
14349,Leonard,A griffin?
14350,Penny,Oh I’m sorry.
14351,Sheldon,Well with that sorted out I’m happy to answer your question Bernadette. Howard started it.
14352,Raj,It’s open.
14353,Leonard,Uh-huh. Seriously six months?
14354,Sheldon,It’s what I do.
14355,Sheldon,Look at this stamp. On what authority are they permitted to mutilate patrons as they enter?
14357,Howard,Uh Sheldon…
14358,Sheldon,Don’t worry Wil Wheaton. I was just leaving.  Da-da-da-da da-da-da!
14359,Sheldon,Yeah she’s right. You’re grown men the kind who are perfectly capable of growing your own moo-staches.
14360,Penny,Okay bye.
14361,Penny,Oh all right if we’re gonna be fancy I should probably put on clean underwear.
14362,Howard,No no no don’t say that. You’re going to be all right.
14363,Penny,Believe me your feelings are just as important as hers.
14364,Leonard,How can you stop now? That’s like walking out of Pinocchio right before he becomes a real boy.
14365,Howard,You mean the strong sexy angel I can’t stop thinking about? Who can say?
14366,Penny,Really? And that didn’t make her feel better?
14367,Howard,I don’t know guys. Maybe this relationship isn’t for me. Maybe I should break up with her.
14368,Leonard,How do you know these things?
14369,Sheldon,…playing Klingon Boggle.
14370,Penny,Oh my God I need help. 
14371,Raj,So how’s your apartment?
14373,Leonard,Sheldon it’s wait I can go home without you? Bye.
14374,Sheldon,All the non-human apes are classified as great apes except one. That means taxonomists created the entire category of lesser ape just to single out the poor gibbon as the weird kid on the playground. Now there’s a hairy little fellow with a genuine beef.
14375,Raj,She says it the same way I do. I’d love that. Everybody in India says it that way. It’s not a big deal.
14376,Penny,Oh Sheldon wait.
14377,Leonard,That’s okay. I can make it over.
14378,Howard,Okay let’s see if this drug works.
14379,Raj,Well I think we should show what earthlings look like.
14380,Penny,Want to take a picture of us and send it to your old friends in the chess club?
14381,Howard,Yes isn’t she an amazing actress.
14382,Leonard,And I have food here. You said you were going to call.
14383,Leonard,Why are you pretending to be outdoors? You hate it.
14384,Leonard,Well why? What’s wrong?
14386,Raj,Then let go of the ring and go.
14387,Raj,Oh yeah we hang out all the time.
14388,Sheldon,No no no no she doesn’t want that she needs a point to point peer network with a range extender.
14389,Sheldon,I hate you.
14390,Sheldon,Really? I didn’t know that.
14391,Sheldon,I see you’re drinking wine.
14392,Penny,What’s this?
14393,Sheldon,To burying the hatchet.
14394,Sheldon,Explain your sneeze.
14395,Sheldon,Well why wouldn’t I be?
14396,Sheldon,Excuse me can I interject something. I’m ordering pizza online is everyone okay with pepperoni?
14397,Leonard,You don’t have buffets in India?
14398,Leonard,And last night.
14399,Sheldon,All right let me restate that. It’s very heavy and I don’t want to.
14400,Sheldon,If the lab room disposable shoe cover fits.
14401,Leonard,Yes and we’ll get back to that. But uh even with your mother here you are deliberately hogging all the attention from my mom. You’re like one of those elephant seal pups that steals the milk from two mothers.
14402,Howard,This is fun. I’ve never used a hydraulic thermoforming press before.
14403,Leonard,May I ask why?
14404,Raj,Come on come on you haven’t even heard it yet. Leonard give me a beat.
14405,Sheldon,Really? This time of year? It’s a bit nippy.
14406,Leonard,Mm don’t have to we have the whole place to ourselves.
14407,Sheldon,Oh heavens no. Since I don’t need to be paid I didn’t need to be hired. I simply came in picked up a tray and started working for the man. Let me get that plate out of your way.
14408,Sheldon,Thank you for coming by gentlemen.
14409,Sheldon,Am I? Let me tell you a story.
14410,Penny,Yeah. Hey do you want to come over to my place have coffee?
14411,Penny,Come on I’m just having some fun with you.
14412,Sheldon,Mm that’s a great question. I like when they’re next to a Chipotle.
14413,Sheldon,Hello.
14414,Raj,In a New Delhi minute.
14415,Sheldon,I knew she wasn’t lead car material.
14416,Penny,Yeah I do like the one where Lois Lane falls from the helicopter and Superman swooshes down and catches her which one was that?
14417,Sheldon,Well she’d just look silly wearing that without the rest of the costume.
14418,Penny,Yes. He said he wants to do something to show you how much you mean to him.
14419,Leonard,Okay. Koothrappali was right. We should have let her watch.
14420,Sheldon,No! I call no Meemaws.
14421,Howard,Didn’t even crack the top ten.
14422,Raj,What’s wrong with Jiffy Lubes?
14423,Raj,Hey you totally got that right! E equals M C squared.
14424,Howard,That’s disgusting dude.
14425,Raj,All right. Imagine yourself in the one place you feel most at home. Where is that?
14426,Sheldon,Well I might ask you the same question. Why do you insist on attempting to drag me into matters which have nothing to do with me? But exist between you and Penny. A person to whom I barely speak. 
14427,Sheldon,I understand. She’s the mean one I’m the fun one.
14428,Sheldon,Balderdash. Matter clearly consists of tiny strings.
14429,Leonard,We should go easy on him. Amy’s out with Stuart tonight.
14430,Sheldon,What you fail to realize is Kripke suffers from a fatal flaw overconfidence from his robot’s massive size and its overwhelming power.
14431,Leonard,Sheldon I was up all night using the new free-electron laser for my X-ray diffraction experiment.
14432,Sheldon,How does that work?
14433,Leonard,Hey how’s dating two women going?
14434,Leonard,Oh it’s called trestling.
14435,Raj,Congratulations.
14436,Sheldon,Actually yes. I do.
14437,Leonard,Ah we’ll miss you too.
14438,Penny,Ooh it smells good.
14439,Sheldon,Penny?
14440,Howard,What kind of scientist are you? Everyone knows you got to make two out of three.
14441,Sheldon,Plus if I do a good job he said he’d bring me back a sailor’s cap.
14442,Leonard,I don’t understand.
14443,Penny,Almost everyone has a past.
14444,Sheldon,Why did I just hear Amy’s name?
14445,Howard,Hmm. Wonder what she sees in Leonard.
14446,Howard,I’ve never been to Palm Springs.
14447,Penny,Oh that’s too bad you guys would make a cute couple.
14448,Sheldon,Fancy a dip my dear?
14449,Raj,That would be nice.
14450,Raj,Come on Leonard dinner.
14451,Sheldon,Of course he has the oracle told us little Neo was the one. You can see the Matrix can’t you.
14452,Leonard,Mmm he’s either isolating the terms of his formula and examining them individually or looking for the alligator that swallowed his hand after Peter Pan cut it off.
14453,Leonard,Sheldon’s escaped and is terrorizing the village.
14454,Penny,Yeah.
14455,Leonard,What.
14456,Leonard,There’s no way we can get to the ridge. The Chemistry Department has us completely cut off.
14457,Penny,Huh? I’m sorry get what?
14458,Leonard,Hell no!
14459,Sheldon,Very well but if this leads to opiates or hallucinogenics you’re going to have to answer to my mother.
14460,Leonard,I’m gonna see where he is.
14461,Penny,Oh Sheldon I’m sorry but there aren’t going to be any parades or judges or prizes.
14462,Howard,So the movie’s not as bad as you thought?
14463,Leonard,Oh sorry yeah. Awkward.
14464,Leonard,The hair products are Sheldon’s.
14465,Howard,I’m worried about the New Horizons space probe.
14466,Penny,Really? Your deeply religious born-again Christian mother wants a test-tube grandbaby born out of wedlock?
14467,Raj,Oh cool I got a sword.
14468,Penny,Oh Leonard. 
14469,Howard,You don’t know that. Prison changes people.
14470,Leonard,Who’s running the red Corvette?
14472,Penny,And we’re back to the first kind of sad.
14473,Howard,Okay. That hurts a little but okay.
14474,Penny,Right but I have to have some sort of degree to date you?
14475,Raj,Um okay. First off know that we all love you and cherish you.
14476,Leonard,Oooaw. This would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath.  What?
14477,Penny,It’s kind of boring. Although it did get exciting for a minute when Amy inhaled a wool ball. How much longer do you think you’ll be?
14478,Penny,Okay Leonard sweetheart you twisted your ankle playing Scrabble.
14479,Howard,Uh do do you like being a mall security guard?
14480,Leonard,It’s nothing fancy but it’ll get you to auditions and at least for now you don’t have to go back to waitressing.
14481,Leonard,Please I’m asking you as a friend.
14482,Sheldon,I won?
14483,Howard,Hey Sheldon guess what I heard today?
14484,Howard,What are you a little kid? Is she gonna cut your dinner into little pieces too?
14485,Sheldon,Yeah we now Penny we don’t consume alcohol during Dungeons & Dragons. It impairs our judgment.
14487,Howard,Ooh. Hot date?
14488,Leonard,You know never have I ever made love in the forest while it was raining.
14489,Leonard,Greetings whatever the hell you are.
14490,Sheldon,Amy I just saw a magic train and reported somebody for cutting the line. If that’s not foreplay I don’t know what is.
14491,Leonard,Fine take the plant.
14492,Sheldon,You realize one of them has sugar on the raisins.
14493,Howard,I don’t freaking believe this.
14494,Sheldon,You must be thinking about Donny and Marie ’cause you and I are clearly talking about Sonny and Cher.
14495,Sheldon,All right that’s eight hours of practice down the drain. And to memorialise this occasion here are your commemorative T-shirts.
14496,Leonard,Well since you’re leaving tomorrow I was wondering if you’d like to go out to dinner with me?
14497,Leonard,Oh for God’s sakes.
14498,Raj,Yeah we have plans this weekend. And if it’s a clear night I’m gonna lay some romantic astronomy on her.
14499,Leonard,Which means a spherical multidimensional superfluid shows the same negative-energy density as space-time. So what do you think? What do you think? So what do you think?
14500,Sheldon,Amy if you want to be my girlfriend again I really want to be your boyfriend.
14501,Leonard,What is that?
14502,Sheldon,I’m calling to invite you to a spontaneous date night tomorrow evening.
14503,Raj,But next time we’ll be cat burglars.
14504,Leonard,You married him instead of me? Good call. Sign the papers.
14505,Leonard,Yes Mother.
14506,Leonard,No no no no Orcs are magic Superman is vulnerable to magic not to mention you already lost Godzilla to the Illinois Cavalry and Hulk.
14507,Penny,Aw is this your first time?
14508,Raj,Incredibly so.
14509,Raj,Yeah whatever. Just go buy a sweater.
14511,Penny,Leonard are you okay?
14512,Penny,I’m so sorry you didn’t get your party.
14513,Howard,Okay. Well a couple of things. Don’t tell them I come from money. I want them to love me for me. They must be insanely hot. Like nines or tens.
14514,Raj,With what?
14515,Raj,Oh please. My sister’s much hotter than your girlfriend and you know it.
14516,Penny,‘Cause I want to surprise him.
14517,Leonard,This is not a good time.
14518,Sheldon,Really? It’s soaking wet.
14519,Leonard,I didn’t do it for the money!
14520,Sheldon,Why? The theory he came up with just got mentioned in Scientific American. He ought to be thrilled.
14521,Penny,Well I know that. How do you know that?
14522,Leonard,Okay for the record what you’re doing is really creepy.
14523,Leonard,You are not a burden and we want you to come back and stay with us.
14525,Raj,He’s been fascinated with dinosaurs lately. Maybe we could get him a fossil.
14526,Leonard,Come on guys.
14527,Penny,No. That’s not true. There’s French there’s Italian. No you’re right it’s the best.
14528,Sheldon,You don’t understand. My flash drive has my paper on astrophysical probes of M-theory effects in the early universe that I was going to give to George Smoot at the conference.
14529,Howard,Aw you brought cookies for everyone?
14530,Penny,Well what?
14531,Howard,Thank you. Would you like to hear more about it in my hot tub? So when do I start?
14532,Penny,I’m so sorry about what happened.
14533,Sheldon,I’m currently single.
14534,Sheldon,Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock was created by Internet pioneer Sam Kass as an improvement on the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors. All hail Sam Kass.
14535,Penny,Uh no.
14536,Penny,Okay you know what? I’m gonna come at this in a whole new way. Sheldon if you try to make a baby with Amy in a petri dish I’m gonna tell your mother on you.
14537,Penny,I just love how you always skip over the part where no one asks.
14538,Raj,Yeah. He brought me back a T-shirt that said My Friend Went to the Space Station and All I Got Was This Lousy T-Shirt
14539,Leonard,Hey you got a second?
14540,Sheldon,But you won’t need much for that.
14541,Leonard,Oh please Mommy. No Mommy.
14542,Leonard,We’ll all be naked in front of each other.
14543,Leonard,You’re kidding. 3-D?
14544,Penny,Oh good I hate her.
14545,Penny,Why not?
14546,Howard,I’m gonna all alone on Valentine’s Day.
14547,Leonard,Although technically Indy was supposed to take the ark to a museum to be studied. He couldn’t even get that done.
14548,Raj,I don’t want to watch Saturn 3. Deep Space Nine is better.
14549,Raj,Uh she’s seeing me.
14550,Leonard,I know but…
14551,Penny,You had to tell him?
14552,Leonard,Let’s get ’em!
14553,Sheldon,Although sometimes she omits the veil entirely.
14554,Penny,Okay good.
14555,Leonard,Hmm I just feel like it would be a good chance for you to bond.
14556,Howard,You’re one to talk. You’ve been complaining about Stuart living here for the past year. I don’t see you showing him the door.
14557,Sheldon,I will graciously overlook the fact that she is an arrogant sub-par scientist who actually believes loop quantum gravity better unites quantum mechanics with general relativity than does string theory. You kids have fun.
14558,Leonard,Well sometimes there’s a secret ending like in The Avengers.
14559,Leonard,I don’t either.
14560,Leonard,Uh we are. In the meantime you’re welcome to whip up a quick character and join us.
14562,Raj,Why don’t you just have Robert E. Lee charge the line with Shiva and Ganesh.
14563,Sheldon,How would you determine the ground state of a quantum system with no exact solution?
14564,Leonard,Not a lot. I just couldn’t start until you walked away.
14565,Howard,Sheldon I’m begging you. I want to go to this mixer and I don’t want to go alone.
14566,Sheldon,Penny hold on. Are you sure things can’t work out with you and Leonard?
14567,Penny,Oh! Look at you guys just hitting it off. I am so good.
14568,Sheldon,It’s a charming illusion but it does not cheer me up.
14569,Sheldon,What? No! Again it’s not the Wesley Crushers. It’s the Wesley “Crushers.”
14570,Howard,I don’t know. Um nuclear war. Accidentally being buried alive. Any of those movies where you get that phone call that says you’re going to die and then you do.
14571,Raj,I don’t know. I mean she’s lonely. He needs a place to stay. I doubt there’s any funny business going on. And even if there was who cares? They’re both adults.
14573,Sheldon,Uh no thank you.
14574,Sheldon,On a cold winter’s night?
14575,Leonard,Sheldon remember we role-played this.
14576,Leonard,Right. To Howard.
14577,Leonard,You too swell also.
14578,Leonard,Yes but the elevator’s been broken for two years.
14579,Raj,I love it I’ll be all like busted and they’ll be like what? And then we’ll all be like oh yeah. Yeah I get it. I wouldn’t make out with me either.
14580,Howard,This has nothing to do with my sperm count.
14581,Raj,Oh. All right.
14582,Howard,I’m sorry I don’t think that’s a good idea.
14583,Leonard,Oh . I think any university would want you. Except of course any university that had already had you. Because they would’ve already wanted you before they you know got you.
14585,Leonard,Okay you leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen.
14586,Raj,Yeah sleeping under the stars with other fans who love the show as much as we do.
14587,Leonard,Well the thing is someone’s coming over.
14588,Penny,What the hell is wrong with you? You told Sheldon? Do you know what a terrible position this puts me in? 
14589,Leonard,I’m gonna guess that your main concern is the time commitment of watching an entire season of a new show.
14590,Leonard,Gee thanks a lot.
14591,Sheldon,All right will you at least stipulate that Star Trek IV The Voyage Home is inarguably the best?
14592,Penny,So?
14593,Penny,Oh I don’t know. Maybe he didn’t like the fact that you called his grandson a wuss.
14594,Raj,We’re here for you man. Whatever you need okay?
14595,Sheldon,Well and you need to drive the car and mind your business.
14596,Howard,Uh no it’s uh pretty private actually it’s over his garage. So the only time I’ll see him is when he pulls his car in does his laundry or practices drums in my dining room.
14597,Leonard,How come you’re up so late?
14598,Howard,Huh what does that make us?
14599,Penny,All right I got to go to work. I’ll walk down with you.
14600,Sheldon,She can cover it in a car ride? I could do 40 minutes on your posture alone.
14601,Raj,I didn’t want to make this one.
14602,Howard,A little baby.
14603,Sheldon,Well Bernadette looks like Saturday night it’s you and me.
14604,Penny,Oh nice. A doctor doctor or a you kind of doctor?
14605,Leonard,A lot of attitude from the woman who thought MC squared was a rapper.
14606,Sheldon,So uh Kripke I was wondering if there’s any chance you could get me some time on the open science grid computer.
14607,Penny,Leonard?
14608,Sheldon,Have I pointed out that I am extremely uncomfortable with dancing loud music and most other forms of alcohol induced frivolity.
14609,Raj,What are you doing?
14610,Howard,As it turns out yes.
14611,Raj,Oh. He’s here to support me so anything you have to say you can say in front of him.
14612,Penny,I don’t know. What do you want to do?
14613,Sheldon,I sense a disturbance in the force.
14614,Penny,You and Amy? Good?
14615,Sheldon,Mm. Sorry. Ah maybe it’s for the best. I hear locomotive smoke is the second leading cause of death among train aficionados.
14616,Leonard,Yeah.
14617,Sheldon,Yes. Why?
14618,Leonard,Well um on one level really really well.
14619,Penny,Wow. So how many girls have you met?
14620,Sheldon,Hang on hang on a second that’s not our answer. What are you doing?
14622,Leonard,He had a panic attack once when he got his head stuck in a sweater.
14623,Howard,The people from People.
14624,Penny,Thank you so do you.
14625,Penny,Yeah that she is. Here you go.
14626,Penny,Oh yeah yeah. It’s real great. Today I drove to Van Nuys for an audition I thought was going to be for a cat food commercial. Turned out to be porn.
14627,Sheldon,I use it to get the right way. The fact that the right way is also my way is a happy coincidence.
14628,Sheldon,No.
14629,Leonard,Why would you want a glow-in-the-dark ant farm?
14630,Howard,So what are you guys doing later? Stuart and I were thinking of going out for a drink.
14631,Leonard,I will not.
14632,Leonard,Thank you. So as you can see not only can you store your favourite equations but you can forward them to your friends or post them on Facebook right from the app.
14633,Raj,You’re being unreasonable. Why can’t I have a desk?
14634,Penny,Well go faster. You’re losing him.
14635,Raj,Now you listen to me I am no longer a child and I will not be spoken to like one. Now if you’d excuse me I have to go throw up.
14636,Penny,But if you don’t mind me asking uh the potato clock how does it work? Is it a trick clock or a trick potato?
14637,Sheldon,Well I’m going to stand here until you change your mind.
14638,Penny,Okay good ’cause I’ve been really struggling with this.
14639,Sheldon,Just wait. You know what? Actually yes thank you. Welcome to my Fortress of Shame.
14640,Penny,I think it’s hot.
14641,Sheldon,Blonde women huh?
14642,Sheldon,I’m working on my three-person chess game.
14643,Penny,Well yeah.
14644,Howard,Hummingbirds are pretty.
14645,Sheldon,You were just spying on your girlfriend through a peephole.
14646,Leonard,I don’t know what to do. I mean the paper’s terrible. But if I tell her she’ll know that I read it and she’ll get really mad.
14647,Howard,Say hello to an exact scale model of me. Oh I’m not dark chocolate. I’m melt-in-your-mouth caramel.
14648,Penny,Come on. It’s still early. Let’s do something.
14649,Leonard,Over my assless chaps you will.
14650,Raj,Which celebrity would you say I look like the most?
14651,Sheldon,Oh ow blueberry in my nose blueberry in my nose!
14652,Howard,Okay look. Instead of trying to reinforce this structure here what if we just ran another line bypass it entirely?
14653,Sheldon,What?
14654,Sheldon,45 seconds is plenty of time for a woman to walk through that door and fall in love with me. You know probably half that if I break out the old cow eyes.
14655,Sheldon,Oh I don’t mind I’m very good at complaining. If it were an Olympic sport I’d complain about what a stupid sport it is and then I’d take home the gold.
14656,Penny,Oh. Sorry I meant to. Anyway um I was just upset with myself. I wasn’t mad at you. I just feel like everything is falling apart.
14657,Sheldon,Next time I might be in a rush it’s good to have a few in the bank.
14658,Raj,Two words deaf chick. It doesn’t matter if I can’t talk because she can’t hear me.
14659,Raj,Oh quick sit.
14660,Sheldon,Oh of course you are. Look at the organizational chart. You’re clearly listed as founder.
14661,Sheldon,And feel free to tell your guest that the Myanmar catfish is also known as the pilgrim fish. In case the turkey’s dry and you need something juicy.
14662,Howard,He’s right. Also what kind of name is Biff? Sounds like when you pop open a can of Pillsbury dough. Biff.
14663,Howard,As if Valentine’s Day wasn’t bad enough you try to kill my dog? And with cheap chocolate no less?
14664,Penny,Thanks a lot.
14666,Howard,Bye. All right. So uh we’re meeting for coffee like two adults. Everybody’s happy. Easy peasy.
14667,Leonard,It’s not a bidding war I’m selling it all to Larry down at the comic book store.
14668,Sheldon,All aboard! Woo-woo! It’s official. I’m an H-O trainiac.
14669,Sheldon, Angry Amy.
14670,Penny,Oh that could be fun. But just to be clear you mean a party bus with booze and music right not like juice boxes and video games?
14671,Leonard,…thousand two hundred and eleven.
14672,Sheldon,Well have you been to the Temple of Mithra?
14673,Penny,Really?
14674,Leonard,It was Penny’s boyfriend’s they broke up.
14675,Howard,Mmm and you know what that means. Someone’s skin’s about to be softer than ever.
14676,Leonard,Ba-ba-ba-ba. Are you sure you want to include him in this?
14677,Leonard,Do it.
14678,Leonard,I’ll check his room.
14679,Sheldon,It’s not just that. Leonard and Penny also made comments about it. And I’m not blind. Even I looked twice when I saw my posterior in these tuxedo pants.
14680,Leonard,He did bite me once. But in his defence I came up behind him while he was eating so…
14681,Howard,So your theme is I saw a rerun of Mad Men and bought some crab puffs from Trader Joe’s? Hate to miss that.
14682,Leonard,Yeah.
14683,Penny,Okay.
14684,Penny,I’m about to. Sign the paper.
14686,Penny,Oh come on don’t make this about you.
14687,Sheldon,We had a difference of opinion.
14688,Raj,Cool. Did she discover a cure for something?
14689,Sheldon,So they asked you to pack up your things and ship out. That’s hard cheese Barry. You’re one of the good ones.
14690,Sheldon,Isn’t that a little juvenile?
14691,Raj,Why are you on a diet?
14692,Leonard,What?
14693,Raj,It’s right here.
14694,Sheldon,He wants to see I.D.
14695,Penny,What are you talking about?
14696,Leonard,That one? Damn right I like that one.
14697,Penny,Uh-huh.
14698,Leonard,I’m sorry. Can we please just do it one more time?
14699,Leonard,Okay let me put it this way in your entire life how many gorgeous women have walked straight up to you in a bar and asked if you wanted to party.
14700,Howard,Maybe. Why not? Who do I have in my life to watch my figure for?
14701,Sheldon,Very well.
14702,Leonard,You still have a cold?
14703,Raj,Okay well can we imply that you’re well-endowed?
14704,Sheldon,Are you prepared to receive your punishment?
14705,Penny,Alfred. Thank you for coming!
14706,Sheldon,Well that last Hunger Games was not my cup of tea.
14707,Leonard,You’re in a good mood.
14708,Sheldon,Penny I just want you to know that you don’t have to live like this. I’m here for you.
14709,Sheldon,So what do you think Howard? It’s not that bad right?
14710,Sheldon,Wrong. We were standing outside my room in the hallway.
14711,Sheldon,Why don’t you take a minute to decide  I can’t keep your secret Penny. I’m going to fold like an energy based anobo protein in conformational space. Like a renaissance triptych. Like a cheap suit.
14712,Sheldon,Well Leonard don’t you want to see the inside of the fort?
14713,Leonard,He never disappoints does he?
14714,Penny,How about boys versus girls?
14715,Leonard,That’s not a bad idea.
14716,Leonard,And we all thank you.
14717,Penny,Sure.
14718,Sheldon,There’s my pretty girlfriend.
14719,Leonard,Yeah well he’s extra special. Hey Shelly. What you doing?
14720,Penny,I think she meant something a little happier.
14721,Sheldon,Leonard I was wrong. Heaven does exist. And it’s in the basement of a urologist’s house in Sherman Oaks.
14722,Penny,Who’s that?
14723,Sheldon,There’s nothing to tell. Maybe I purchased a book entitled Don’t Sweat the Small Stuff and I followed its wise suggestions one of which was stop and smell the flowers.
14725,Penny,Oh it’s okay I understand.
14726,Leonard,Cool.  Uh-oh!
14727,Penny,And for the world’s tallest second grader apple juice.
14728,Sheldon,I understand.
14729,Penny,Oh let me guess. You guys are drafting your fantasy accounting firms.
14730,Penny,Come on do I really have to?
14731,Leonard,Laser’s warmed up.
14732,Raj,Okay I’m getting some mixed messages here.
14733,Penny,How is that not a braniac?
14734,Leonard,Walls are getting closer.
14735,Raj,You know we’re both down on our luck. Maybe you and I should try to get a place together.
14736,Howard,Hey guys.
14737,Raj,His only options here are to fake a heart attack or have a real one.
14738,Sheldon,Yeah I’ve been reading up on biomechanics. I think you’ll be surprised at my… Wah! Oh!
14739,Raj,I did. It was beautiful.
14740,Raj,What does that mean?
14741,Sheldon,No it’s a novelty I ordered off the Internet. Now did you hear the click?
14742,Leonard,Problem?
14743,Penny,Yeah I got it I got it. Uh Zack these are my friends Bernadette and Amy.
14744,Raj,I understand. In seventh grade I played Spin the Bottle and it landed on Alina Shankar. She said if I came near her she would break the bottle and cut me.
14745,Sheldon,Done.
14746,Raj,Wait till you see the crib we found.
14747,Leonard,Huh.
14748,Howard,No Daddy no. There are lots of other ways to teach me responsibility. I know you can give me an egg and make me take care of it for a week.
14749,Leonard,I thought I heard something.
14750,Leonard,Does this mean Emily’s not in the picture anymore?
14751,Sheldon,Uh no. We lock that door lower our underpants a little and make a baby.
14752,Leonard,Well she’s not really into that kind of stuff.
14753,Howard,Why don’t you just do the test?
14754,Leonard,I can’t remember a time when you weren’t talking.
14755,Penny,We can but all right.
14756,Leonard,How?
14757,Sheldon,All right. Can I help you?
14758,Penny,You really didn’t like it Sheldon?
14759,Raj,I don’t believe it.
14760,Sheldon,I know.
14761,Penny,Ooh now we’re talking.
14762,Howard,Oh you mean passive-aggressive like posting pictures of you and your wife eating cosmopolitan balls that you know belong in my mouth?
14763,Howard,Of course you have. They’re an engineer’s dream. Anything you can design a 3-D printer can make out of plastic.
14764,Sheldon,That’s funny because my father was not a very clever man.
14765,Penny,Well I wouldn’t exactly call it a hook-up.
14766,Howard,Hey. Good to see you.
14767,Leonard,Do you remember his old theme song?
14768,Leonard,NORAD? You’re using military aircraft?
14769,Leonard,I draw my broadsword.
14770,Raj,Hello.
14771,Leonard,Actually this is about where she and I are going to live.
14772,Howard,Has it occurred to you you’re missing the big picture? If you look at neutron scattering data…
14773,Leonard,I’ll print out the shipping label. Uh-oh.
14774,Leonard,Sheldon you need to work in the morning.
14775,Penny,What’s your name?
14776,Leonard,Are we playing individual or teams?
14777,Sheldon,You know I can’t keep a secret.
14778,Leonard,I couldn’t just take the compliment. I had to ask why. You know I do understand what you’re feeling. My brother and sister’s accomplishments have always been held over my head.
14779,Leonard,And you think we can get those guys to reprogram Sheldon? Cool.
14780,Penny,Oh God.
14781,Penny,Ew.
14782,Sheldon,Look Penny I wish I could be more lenient with you but since you’ve become a permanent member of our social group I have to hold you to the same standards as everybody else.
14783,Raj,Good day Mrs. Davis. This is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali from the astrophysics department. Don’t be alarmed I’m not really in space. Anyhoo I’d like to take this opportunity to tell you about myself so sit back relax and enjoy the following 90-minute video.
14784,Leonard,Maybe John Connor’s aboard and she’s protecting him from an evil Terminator.
14785,Penny,All right honey let me tell you a story. There was a guy I liked and I never told him how I felt. Eventually he started going out with someone else and I always regretted it. Do you see where I’m going with this?
14786,Sheldon,I know. Let’s go see the new Spider-Man movie.
14787,Penny,Right and if you can’t understand it it’s not a fact.
14788,Sheldon,Well I have been toying around with an idea for 4D chess.
14789,Sheldon,Oh your concern for me is touching. It will serve you well when you take me to the dentist tomorrow.
14790,Penny,What are you doing here?
14791,Penny,Really?  I’m actually not that into music. So hey your friend’s really cute anything going on with you two.
14792,Howard,Why me of all people?
14793,Sheldon,Whether or not he was trying to kill me. For the record I maintain he was. Where are you going?
14794,Howard,Oh no.
14795,Howard,Then why do you watch these things?
14796,Sheldon,I see. Well. At this point I should inform you that I intend to form my own team and destroy the molecular bonds that bind your very matter together and reduce the resulting particulate chaos to tears.
14797,Sheldon,What’s going on?
14798,Leonard,Sheldon?
14799,Sheldon,Shhhhh!
14800,Leonard,We don’t order egg rolls.
14801,Penny,Amy do us a favour please drive.
14802,Raj,I don’t understand it. I’m a nice guy I have a great job I’m well-educated come from a good family. Why don’t women want to be with me?
14803,Penny,No really how much?
14804,Leonard,So menus.
14805,Sheldon,Well neither is the rule that you have to hold your girlfriend’s hand at the movies. You know. That doesn’t stop you from pawing at me like you’re a bear and I’m a trash can full of sweets.
14806,Leonard,Yeah.
14807,Sheldon,Greece.
14808,Penny,Should I ask?
14809,Leonard,Well I’d like to be green but you know you always take it.
14810,Leonard,They’re gonna get beaten up at that club.
14811,Leonard,Okay I can breathe again. Babe they want to have sex.
14812,Sheldon,Pretty sure’s not very scientific is this how you normally work just hunches and guesses and stuff?
14813,Leonard,Sheldon let’s go.
14815,Howard,I was Googling that girl I’ve been dating and I found her blog.
14816,Sheldon,As someone from the tropical subcontinent of India you should know that fanning yourself in a humid environment only raises your body temperature.
14817,Howard,Check.
14818,Raj,Yeah yeah a little.
14819,Leonard,Wow!
14820,Leonard,Oh looks like it.
14821,Leonard,Well I’m done with Penny. I’m going to be more realistic and go after someone my own speed.
14822,Howard,I was homesick.
14823,Sheldon,I’ll let you know after tonight. Unlike some people I’m going in with an open mind. Who am I kidding? Of course we all know it’s O-gauge or no gauge.
14824,Penny,Oh thanks for asking until I did.
14825,Raj,What’s the matter?
14826,Raj,Hey people were still talking about that party on siete de Mayo.
14827,Leonard,I’m her boyfriend.
14828,Sheldon,Hardly. Fear of heights is illogical. Fear of falling on the other hand is prudent and evolutionary. What would you say is the minimum altitude I need to achieve to cement our new-found friendship?
14829,Penny,Okay enough about the napkin. What else you hiding in there?
14830,Raj,Hello Father. We need to talk.
14831,Penny,Ice cream?
14832,Leonard,The same reason we don’t do a lot of fun stuff. You.
14833,Raj,Oh okay. Sounds like it’s me and you Sheldon. How about we sic some guppies on those puppies?
14834,Sheldon,It has been pointed out to me that some of the things I said to you could be construed as offensive and I would like to offer you my sincerest apology.
14835,Leonard,First thing tomorrow morning we’re back at it.
14836,Penny,Yeah.
14837,Raj,Hey Leonard Sheldon kicked me out of the room gave me your key.
14838,Howard,No. We can do this by ourselves.
14839,Penny,A few minutes it is.
14840,Raj,She didn’t take my order.
14841,Penny,I’m listening.
14842,Penny,Screw him. You’re fine.
14843,Raj,And where were you?
14844,Howard,I can actually feel the toxins being pulled out of my skin.
14845,Sheldon,Un-unravelable.
14846,Howard,You unfriended me? Seriously?
14847,Penny,I should probably go.
14848,Raj,Hey you think it’d be okay if I brought Claire to the wine tasting?
14849,Leonard,No no. It’s kind of crazy. I’ve never fooled around in the lab before.
14850,Penny,Okay I don’t know you people. I’m just an innocent woman wondering if this shoe store will take my Texaco card.
14851,Howard,I wonder what he’s doing right this very second.
14852,Leonard,Give it a minute. Is that a little smile I see there? I should go.
14853,Howard,How many sips of that beer did he have?
14854,Leonard,So it’s based on your life?
14855,Sheldon,I’m ready.
14856,Raj,My parents are making me choose between money and you. I choose you.  And that necklace yeah that too. But none of those things matter because we have something better. We have love.
14857,Leonard,I’ll friend you on Facebook.
14858,Sheldon,All right Ms. Jenson. Uh before we begin may I offer you a refreshment? Water coffee tea a marijuana cigarette?
14859,Sheldon,To be played with.
14860,Leonard,Sheldon sit down.
14861,Sheldon,Gentlemen I think I’ve come up with a fun way to get young people interested in science. Physics Mad-Libs. Now give me a number.
14862,Sheldon,The university they think they can do whatever they want. We just have to sit there and take it.
14863,Sheldon,Did you hear that Leonard? There’s plenty we could do about it. Do you have a card?
14864,Howard,There’s also a time to stop eating too many jelly beans. And it’s when you’re ten.
14865,Howard,I do. I just wouldn’t tell my girlfriend.
14866,Leonard,Excuse me my friend is having an allergic reaction to peanuts.
14867,Penny,Hang on. Let’s see where he’s going.
14869,Leonard,Won’t.
14870,Sheldon, It’s not the first time. I have a twin sister whose assaults began in utero. If only I’d had the presence of mind to reabsorb her then I’d have a mole with hair in it instead of a tedious yearly Christmas letter.
14871,Leonard,That’s different. I’m like the little girl in Poltergeist and he’s the creepy thing in the TV.
14872,Sheldon,No no no no!
14873,Sheldon,I’m not in San Francisco. I’m on a train. Were you even listening to me?
14874,Penny,You really want me to pick up your mother all by myself?
14875,Penny,It’s more like how girls end up at a Best Western hotel with a 34-year-old guy named Luther.
14876,Penny,Uh hang on. I don’t think so I’m clicking on one weird trick for a flat belly but I’m still seeing celebrities who look like their pets.
14877,Leonard,Slowly like putting a new fish in a tank. You don’t just drop it in you let the bag sit in the water a while.
14878,Leonard,Sorry about that.
14879,Penny,No. I’m the one that introduced him to her. I’ve got to say something.
14880,Sheldon,Or amongst if they were feeling whimsically archaic.
14881,Leonard,Aw oh thank you. That is so sweet.
14882,Raj,Excuse me.
14883,Leonard,Sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry! Never mind we’re cool.
14884,Raj,Just that I’m definitely not gay.
14885,Leonard,What about you Raj?
14886,Leonard,Yeah.
14887,Sheldon,Wait. Hold on. I believe screw it I’m going in is what I said to your mother last night. Don’t worry I didn’t really say that. I find the concept of coitus ridiculous and off-putting.
14888,Leonard,It’s a bachelor party. Lighten up.
14889,Penny,Um home to write some bad cheques.
14890,Sheldon,Yes but the communication is not encrypted.
14891,Sheldon,I just said that. This conversation has started to circle. Meeting adjourned.
14892,Leonard,Never mind. I got it.
14893,Leonard,Really you guys do not need to throw me a going-away party.
14894,Sheldon,Oh Dear Lord more rules? Where does it stop? Can I want to go because I have to want to go?
14895,Penny,I mean we’re basically the same age.
14896,Howard,I’m a lamb.
14897,Leonard,Maybe they reassigned it because you never use it.
14898,Leonard,They’re gorgeous.
14899,Sheldon,You take that back.
14900,Sheldon,Again time machine.
14901,Penny,Oh no no those hooks are gone.
14902,Leonard,That sounds fun.
14903,Raj,Annie Ogly.
14904,Sheldon,Oh dear. Penny have you been recording shows on our DVR again?
14905,Penny,No we’re a team. If you can’t go in we’re not going in.
14906,Penny,Well why were you so angry?
14907,Howard,I keep telling you if I wasn’t an astrophysicist I would have been a party planner. It was always a coin flip.
14908,Raj,Oh you mean passive-aggressive like posting pictures of you and your wife eating cosmopolitan balls that you know belong in my mouth?
14909,Penny,Yeah that’s basically what I said.
14910,Sheldon,So if there is an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon.
14911,Penny,Oh no no no. It is just beginning.
14912,Sheldon,Oh great see you at seven.
14913,Leonard,I don’t know what to tell you Sheldon. I’m going to see Priya. Everyone’s over there. You coming or not?
14914,Leonard,Uh do you know how Penny told Raj he should have left her off his list?
14915,Sheldon,Father.
14916,Leonard,Well maybe you should tell him.
14917,Sheldon,The only man who can restore any semblance of balance to our universe.
14918,Penny,She’s not one of those phonies okay. She wrote a book and has her own Web site.
14919,Leonard,My point is immortality is not only a possibility it is real.
14920,Penny,Okay great. Well then why don’t you come over next Saturday and watch the game with us.
14921,Sheldon,Leonard do you think I’m funny?
14922,Penny,Yeah sure. What are you washing? A crocodile?
14923,Penny,Amy stop it. Oh God I’m so nervous.
14924,Howard,No.
14925,Leonard,I really don’t know.
14927,Leonard,Now that Penny and I are engaged I thought we might want to talk about our living arrangements.
14928,Penny,I don’t think so.
14929,Sheldon,Fine we’ll abide by the Geneva Convention. But ask yourself this in the course of our lives how much lunch money has been taken from us? How many kites? How many Scooby-Doo Trapper Keepers?
14930,Sheldon, Mrs Davis? I know you’re in there. I saw your car in the parking lot.
14931,Leonard,If you get him a job he’s gonna live here forever!
14933,Sheldon,All right all right look l let’s all let’s remain calm and analyse this situation. Now I realize that you’ve only known each other for less than a day but is it possible this crankiness is because your cycles have synced?
14934,Raj,It’s your anniversary? Oh my God I had no idea. Amy please let me make this right.
14935,Leonard,Sheldon I got this.
14936,Raj,That’s true. He didn’t just stay there and talk about his feelings with the other psychotic villains. He he broke out and poisoned Gotham’s water supply.
14937,Leonard,Thank you that’s very comforting.
14938,Penny,Yeah this is a special circumstance.
14939,Sheldon,Let me guess.
14940,Sheldon,That’s what I said.
14941,Howard,I have no choice.
14942,Sheldon,Well we’ll just see about that.
14943,Penny,Oh. Um okay. Why don’t you give me an hour and come over?
14944,Raj,It’s fantastic apparently the camera loves me and I it. They shot me in front of a starry background where I posed like this.  They’re going to digitally add a supernova they say it’s the perfect metaphor for my incandescent talent.
14945,Penny,Oh I’ll wedge it right in there.
14946,Leonard,Mm dreamily doodling Mrs. Leonard Hofstadter in a notebook?
14947,Raj,What?
14948,Sheldon,I don’t blame you. You were intoxicated.
14949,Penny,Yeah they already know I’m a pharmaceutical sales rep.
14950,Howard,Okay that’s enough. Write down loving son.
14951,Raj,Maybe. If it did I’d be famous. I’d be on the cover of magazines. And then instead of living alone in my tiny apartment I’d have a big mansion.
14952,Howard,You know if you think about it tonight was kind of like a real-life Game of Thrones.
14953,Leonard,Sheldon just buy scalped tickets with us.
14954,Sheldon,Everybody has a date. Even you Mario going after Princess Peach. And what am I doing I’m just enabling you.
14955,Sheldon,Yeah I’ll definitely live long enough. Vitamin C.
14956,Sheldon,Stuart wait. I do know what it feels like to be left out.
14957,Sheldon,Very well then. Get over my knee. Let’s begin.
14958,Sheldon,What?
14959,Howard,I should go.
14960,Penny,Oh in ours we would just run around town looking for a store that would sell us beer.
14961,Raj,You know I have too much self-esteem to let this girl guilt me into getting back together with her.
14962,Howard,Oh Lucy you don’t have to answer that. Don’t put her on the spot. She hates that. Am I right? Tell her how much you hate being put on the spot. Go ahead tell her.
14963,Sheldon,Oh very well. What are the sleeping arrangements? We’ve only been dating for three years. If we were to share a room people might talk.
14964,Sheldon,Are you concerned because the world is filled with big dogs and bullies?
14965,Leonard,Sheldon it’s two o’clock in the morning.
14966,Sheldon,She sounds exactly like you.
14967,Howard,No no no that would be crazy. I mean if I were hitting on you you’d know it ’cause you’d feel uncomfortable and a little sad for me.
14968,Howard,Sorry I’m just trying to cheer my buddy up. Rotting Zombie. Sheldon’s new Facebook photo.
14969,Penny,My dad killed my pig with his tractor.
14970,Penny,Oh come on don’t be like that.
14972,Leonard,Ready.
14973,Raj,I find a girl I like and you’re stealing her?
14974,Raj,Are they actually arguing about comic books?
14975,Penny,But I never gave the man a chance to explain.
14976,Sheldon,Oh it won’t hurt my feelings. Go ahead Amy say I’m annoying. I’m annoying. I’m annoying. I’m annoying. Yeah now uh now where are you going? Look you know you want to say it say it. Say I’m annoying. Go ahead say it. Say it. Say it. Amy say it. Well she can’t stand it when I’m right.
14977,Leonard,Okay. Good luck.
14978,Sheldon,Did she say anything about me? Never mind. I don’t care. Well if you care you can find out and tell me. Just don’t be shocked when you find out that I don’t care.
14979,Howard,You’re right I am humiliated. Thanks for pointing it out. You’re such a jerk.
14980,Leonard,What I don’t believe is that you tried to run him over.
14981,Raj,I will. You can download my paper on the Van Allen Belts from the university server as well.
14982,Howard,I should say so he appears to be a member of the Nigerian royal family.
14983,Sheldon,No we haven’t spoken since your abrupt departure last night caused us to forfeit to Stuart and his dastardly ringer Wil Wheaton.
14984,Leonard,If we do I am splurging on the best sinus irrigator money can buy.
14985,Raj,Wh what happened?
14986,Raj,Okay I get it he’s a bad guy. Sign here.
14987,Leonard,I’m done anybody else?
14988,Sheldon,Depending on the depth that’s either a proctologist or a general surgeon.  Oh!
14989,Leonard,No. No I understand. I got too intense you had to back off.
14990,Sheldon,Penny I know you mean well offering the skills of the hill folk but um here in town we don’t churn our own butter we don’t uh make dresses out of gunny sacks and uh we sure as shootin’ don’t get our hair cut by bottle-blonde…
14991,Raj,Yeah but why are you fat?
14993,Sheldon,You’re back.
14994,Howard,Hey.
14995,Leonard,Good. I’m taking that disgusting chart off the fridge.
14996,Sheldon,You can’t slay the guard captain with a bronze dagger my Lord it’s like the car key in your apartment door all over again.
14997,Howard,He’s right.
14998,Sheldon,Chair.
14999,Sheldon,Oh calm down. I already put away five of these. You see? No muss no fuss not a single cuss.
15000,Howard,Oh what’s so gothic about vodka and cranberry juice?
15001,Leonard,So how was work today?
15002,Raj,Mrs. Davis I uh I must confess I came here tonight in a futile attempt to pick up some lonely postdoc but instead I got to connect with you at a human level. That’s a much better evening. You’re a lovely person.
15003,Howard,None of your business. Take it or leave it.
15005,Raj,Sheldon I think you might find the support you’re looking for if you realize that relationships are a give and take. She can only be there for you as much as you are for her.
15007,Howard,Dr Gablehouser.
15008,Raj,Dude how many races can you offend in a single breath?
15009,Sheldon,Yeah well they shouldn’t have. My calculations were wrong. There must be some resonance between the elements I didn’t know about.
15010,Sheldon,Some important new information has come to light. Women are the worst. I thought it was paper cuts but I was wrong. No piece of paper ever cut me this deep.
15011,Sheldon,That’s my boy.
15012,Raj,How so?
15013,Raj,This is it.
15014,Leonard,Fine.
15015,Penny,Okay. There’s one not far from here. Come on. Let’s go.
15016,Sheldon,Since when is eggnog a Christmas drink? Eggs are available all year ’round. I’ve been known to enjoy this poolside.
15017,Sheldon,You can’t go home. You have to take me to the dentist at four o’clock.
15018,Raj,No this is creepy.
15019,Sheldon,Oh. Hello doggie. Nice doggie. I bet you think you smell hot dogs. Look a cat!
15020,Leonard,Look I am in the Halo battle of my life here there’s this kid in Copenhagen he has no immune system so all he does is sit in his bubble and play Halo 24/7.
15021,Penny,Are we ever going to get to the elevator?
15022,Sheldon,Albert Einstein.
15023,Leonard,Yeah it is a little like getting into Dracula’s coffin.
15024,Sheldon,You know I am a fan of ventriloquism. Maybe you me and your dummy could go get a hot beverage. He could talk while you drink.
15025,Howard,So why don’t you get it fixed?
15026,Howard,Follow my lead. Almost. We’re we’re going to go out into the hallway and uh make a dramatic entrance.
15027,Sheldon,Yes but he’s going to a better place where he won’t get beat up. So much.
15029,Penny,Not for twenty six hundred years.
15030,Howard,Tricking Penny into getting engaged.
15032,Sheldon,If there’s going to be a theme I should let you know that I don’t care for luau toga or under the sea.
15033,Penny,I said I don’t want to talk about it.
15034,Sheldon,Well but hear me out. The atomic bomb was The Manhattan Project. Windows 95 was originally Project Chicago. For our app I would humbly suggest Project Nodlehs.
15035,Leonard,I think we’re fine Stuart.
15036,Leonard,So… fish.
15037,Sheldon,Stephen Hawking hates me.
15038,Leonard,Here’s my chicken curry. Howard your shrimp biryani.
15039,Leonard,Buddy.
15040,Sheldon,He left a boy he returns a boy-sized hero.
15041,Howard,I still love it. I just think there’s room for improvement.
15042,Howard,Guys when I look at the two of you starting your lives together it fills my heart It fills my heart okay I’m going to need a minute.
15044,Leonard,Great timing. My check sphincter light just went on.
15045,Leonard,And your poll numbers just keep dropping.
15046,Leonard,Oh how will we ever get used to the new you?
15047,Penny,You’re just coitusing with me aren’t you?
15048,Sheldon,No. This is. Stop looking at my legs.
15049,Penny,Nancy. Her name is Nancy.
15050,Raj,Oh you want to bet? You never exercise.
15051,Sheldon,This is a very old building.
15052,Penny,What are you doing in my bedroom?
15053,Penny,You’re kidding right?
15054,Sheldon,I will not calm down. This affront to justice and decency cannot go unanswered. As Captain Jean-Luc Picard once said the line must be drawn here! This far no farther!
15055,Howard,And snacks.
15056,Sheldon,No yeah yeah he’s got it and that’s not surprising. This is something I long ago came to peace with in my role as the beta male. Open it. 
15057,Penny,Okay that’s morbid. Send it back.
15058,Sheldon,It’s Saturday night. Saturday is laundry night.
15059,Raj,No Daddy no. There are lots of other ways to teach me responsibility. I know you can give me an egg and make me take care of it for a week.
15060,Howard,Oh okay Leonard?
15061,Leonard,I guess this could count as an adventure.
15062,Howard,Ugh Toby what did you do in a past life to be so disgusting now?
15063,Sheldon,When does the CSI team get here?
15064,Sheldon,Good Penny reminder bowling tonight at seven o’clock.
15065,Leonard,So it’s nothing I did? It’s her problem?
15066,Sheldon,I’d rather you pretend I didn’t say it. I see you bought Mama Italia marinara spaghetti sauce.
15067,Leonard,Oh yeah. The Mr. Spock cuckoo clock.
15068,Sheldon,Excuse me excuse me can I please see a show of hands? Who here takes issue with this person cutting the line?
15069,Howard,Yeah it’s a crushed velvet baby cape.
15070,Sheldon,Oh it’s all right I do. Oh! You’re in for what my mother calls a real Eye-talian treat. .
15071,Penny,I can’t do it with you staring at me.
15072,Sheldon,Hello.
15073,Sheldon,I read his research and it’s leaps and bounds ahead of mine. Which means the mommy of the smartest physicist at the university is not my mommy as I had thought. It’s his mommy.
15074,Leonard,This could work.
15075,Howard,Great. They get girlfriends and they just abandon us?
15076,Leonard,Yeah.
15077,Leonard,Why would you do that?
15078,Penny,Um I don’t know. You’ll be gone and I’ll notice.
15079,Sheldon,What if someone kidnaps me forces me to record my voice and then cuts off my thumb?
15080,Leonard,No specific to my situation.
15081,Sheldon,What do you see in her?
15082,Penny,Howard wait. Sheldon I think we should tell them.
15083,Raj,Well I ran a simulation that allowed me to correct for the observational efficiency.
15084,Raj,Hey guys I’m trying to cook in here.
15085,Sheldon,You at least listen to the premise. Since you were born in Germany I thought we could talk
15086,Leonard,Can I sleep on your couch tonight?
15087,Penny,I’m calling him.
15088,Leonard,Are you set on people laughing with you? ‘Cause if you’re cool with at you…
15089,Howard,Thirty visionaries under thirty years of age to watch as they challenge the preconceptions of their fields.
15090,Raj,We should have asked her to get some Funyuns.
15091,Leonard,We’re just supposed to pretend it’s not a big deal?
15093,Penny,Oh. So is this Bruce Lee’s nerdy brother Stan?
15094,Sheldon,You know I have to say Penny I don’t understand why you of all people are encouraging Leonard to do this.
15095,Leonard,Yes. It’s my water.
15096,Sheldon,So we’d be perpetrating a ruse?
15097,Leonard,Nothing bad just that last night was fine.
15098,Sheldon,I have a lady friend who will be staying with me for a few days.
15099,Penny,I don’t know. You could talk to her and maybe if it comes up you could ask if she’s heard about the drug.
15100,Penny,Hi. Here are the make-up sponges you asked for.
15101,Leonard,What?
15102,Leonard,Sheldon not now.
15103,Penny,Hi.
15105,Sheldon,I apologize. He’s only an experimental physicist.
15106,Penny,All right it’s called Never Have I Ever. The rules are simple. Someone says something they’ve never done but if you have done it you take a drink.
15107,Leonard,You’re right I’m sorry.  I’m not!
15108,Sheldon,When you understand the laws of physics Penny anything is possible. And may I add mwah-ha-ha!
15109,Raj,Be afraid of Penny nice very crafty.
15110,Penny,Why you guys going somewhere?
15111,Sheldon,Where?
15112,Howard,Holy crap.
15113,Sheldon,Why would I touch her she’s covered with airplane germs.
15114,Leonard,We’re not… Where’s my Bat Signal?
15115,Penny,Yeah really well my friends at work found it my sister found it judging by my email a number of prisoners at the Michigan State Penitentiary found it.
15116,Sheldon,No. But it’s a shame our society mocks the differently uvulated. Who was at the door?
15117,Sheldon,I have two words for you Jurassic Park. This day just keeps getting worse and worse.
15118,Leonard,Well yes and you’re listed as Chief Executive Officer Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer.
15119,Howard,Howard please you can’t treat the man differently just because he’s disabled. That’s not okay.
15120,Raj,You hear that Stuart? I’ve got a dog and a godchild you have nothing.
15121,Penny,Okay maybe I’m the one who’s sad.
15122,Sheldon,Well that’s enough of that. Sorry to interrupt. You two enjoy your date. Here’s a dollar for your troubles. Get yourself some Sour Patch Kids.
15123,Leonard,That’s amazing. You’ll be like his pit crew. A word of caution I would not do your Stephen Hawking impression in front of him.
15124,Raj,Leonard’s putting disgusting memories in my memory foam mattress. Can I stay here tonight?
15125,Penny,Things are looking good.
15126,Sheldon,For me.
15127,Leonard,You do realize you own his ass right now.
15128,Leonard,I bought a baseball cap.
15129,Howard,Come on. Don’t make me beg. And I’m from India so I know how to do it.
15131,Penny,To you?
15132,Howard,Happy and well-fed. You see that’s what I’m taking from that story.
15133,Penny,Well of course he’s desirable. I mean he’s great. He’s smart he’s sweet and ooh in the bedroom whew let me tell you he really tries.
15134,Leonard,Hey what took you guys so long?
15135,Penny,Oh sweetie that’s what sex is for.
15136,Sheldon,Alright let’s dispense with the friendly banter I believe you know why I’m here.
15137,Penny,What is it?
15138,Sheldon,I’d like to say it’s nostalgia but every time I think of throwing anything away my ears start to ring and I get butterflies in my stomach. And then it feels like the butterflies get eaten by rats and then the the rats get eaten by…
15139,Penny,Oh. Hey Sheldon. What can I get ya?
15140,Raj,I don’t know.
15141,Leonard,I mean I’m a perfectly nice guy. There’s no reason we couldn’t go to the restaurant and have a lovely dinner. Maybe take a walk afterwards talk about things we have in common “you love pottery? I love pottery!” You know there’s a pause we both know what’s happening I lean in we kiss it’s a little tentative at first but then I realise she’s kissing me back and she’s biting my lower lip you know she wants me this thing is going the distance we’re going to have sex! Oh God! Oh my God!
15142,Sheldon,Here. I’m hoping once you reap the endorphic rewards of the steady clickety-clack of steel wheels on polished rails your sour disposition will abate.
15143,Leonard,That’s all of us. Can I use the laptop?
15144,Sheldon,Hi.
15145,Raj,Hey can I ask you a favour? Would you mind taking Cinnamon for a walk?
15146,Leonard,Maybe we should get you home.
15147,Howard,Yeah that’s good. Keep telling yourself that. 
15148,Sheldon,But I haven’t decided yet.
15149,Sheldon,Stop yelling! I’m not happy about this.
15150,Leonard,During the kissing? What did you do sneeze in her mouth? I did that to a girl once.
15151,Sheldon,Yeah he’s right. Once in a moment of candour I told Amy that her hair reminded me of a duck caught in an oil spill. She stormed out. Which was sad because we were playing Scrabble and I had all the letters to spell persimmon.
15152,Leonard,Sheldon.  What’s going on?
15153,Howard,Oh come on. What’s the worst that could come of this meeting?
15154,Sheldon,Oh I hope so. What happened to you last night?
15155,Sheldon,Heard you the first time.
15156,Sheldon,Really? They don’t let strange women from honky-tonks come in and play with $200million government projects on distant planets?
15157,Leonard,There were only two people there?
15158,Penny,Hey look it’s Shamy.
15159,Leonard,Hmm I think I got them all. Nope they’re not in there.
15160,Sheldon,Obviously you’re not well suited for three-dimensional chess perhaps three dimensional candyland would be more your speed.
15161,Sheldon,Yeah well no not to them. To me. Time traveling mailbox. The only time that traveled was an hour and half of my life down the toilet.
15162,Leonard,What?
15163,Sheldon,Ooh good question. Everyone loves stories about Sheldon Cooper boy genius.
15164,Howard,Bert has a room for rent.
15165,Sheldon,I am a bit of a unicorn. Well you certainly seem like a special lady uh but as you know you missed the deadline so thanks for playing.
15166,Sheldon,Hello. I didn’t expect you this evening.
15167,Raj,Leonard stole my woman and he knew full well I was only six to eight months away from making my move.
15169,Sheldon,Wait. You have to drive me.
15170,Sheldon,It’s simple biology. There’s nothing I can do about it.
15171,Sheldon,Shame on you. Where would we be if poodle breeders had that attitude? I’ll tell you. We would have the standard and the miniature poodle but no toy or teacup. Which by the way is not an officially recognized breed but that’s just poodle politics.
15172,Howard,No no Penny don’t dismiss his feelings.
15173,Leonard,No.
15174,Sheldon,May I point out in a parallel universe your friends are saying Maggie McGeary she sounds lovely.
15176,Sheldon,You should know I had nothing to do with that.
15177,Penny,Okay now holding sides of hearth in position lower mantelpiece assembly onto top tabs.
15178,Sheldon,Well isn’t this nice. Sometimes the baby wins.
15179,Sheldon,It’s totally understandable. In bladder voiding as in real estate it’s location location location.
15180,Leonard,Okay well there is a lot of merit to both theories.
15181,Sheldon,She called me dumbass.
15182,Raj,Well what if it’s one consenting adult and one adult who pretends to consent because he’s afraid of being alone?
15183,Leonard,Oh. You know I’m really starting to not like this guy.
15184,Sheldon,Is there some problem?
15185,Howard,Why?
15186,Raj,How about Lasic?
15187,Sheldon,Fine I’ll go. Just for the record my Aunt Ruth died in a hospital. She went in to visit my Uncle Roger caught something and bit the dust a week later. The two of them now share a coffee can on my mother’s mantel.
15188,Leonard,Uh-huh.
15189,Raj,Sorry go ahead and make your joke.
15190,Penny,Yup we’re all in.
15191,Sheldon,Oh good one.
15192,Sheldon,My apologies you’ve been sitting in it all along. Leonard you want to slide over one?
15193,Sheldon,I think a more amusing violation of Raj’s trust is when Howard convinced him that foreigners give presents to Americans on Thanksgiving.
15194,Leonard,Yeah it’s from Changs.
15195,Sheldon,All right great. Just give me one minute and I’ll get started on a new roommate agreement. Yeah. nothing from Pratt we’re good.
15196,Howard,I’m sure many women in happy relationships spend their nights skyping with their ex-boyfriend Sanjay.
15197,Sheldon,What’s going on?
15198,Penny,Oh we just want you to be prepared for any surprises that might happen tomorrow.
15200,Howard,As long as we’re apologising Sheldon I I’m sorry I used your toothbrush.
15201,Raj,Or as I called it Planet Bollywood. Anyway because of my discovery People magazine is naming me one of their thirty under-30 to watch.
15202,Sheldon,Oh foolish Wil Wheaton it was never off.
15203,Penny,Maybe it was the first whisper of winter in the air or maybe it was the unconscious handsome man with porcelain skin and curious clothing she was about to discover lying in the field. A man who would open her mind to new possibilities and her body to new feelings.
15204,Penny,Oh gee thanks Leonard. That didn’t occur to me. If he doesn’t apologize by 5 o’clock he is going to spend the night in jail.
15205,Penny,What? Here give me give me. Oh my God. Oh my God they’re coming right towards us.
15206,Leonard,Nothing I’m fine.
15207,Sheldon,That is what is referred to as a burn on you.
15208,Sheldon,How can you be sure?
15209,Sheldon,Oh bad news. Amy’s making me go shopping with her later so looks like none of us can go.
15210,Sheldon,A second what? Pair of underwear?
15211,Penny,He’s still in surgery.
15212,Howard,Okay uh let’s get things started. Um why don’t we go around the room say your name and why you broke up with me. Want to kick it off?
15213,Sheldon,In fact you did but I was referring to Howard.
15214,Leonard,It’s just where I need them. You know she doesn’t have a lot of closet space.
15215,Penny,Hi.
15216,Howard,Ready for lunch?
15217,Sheldon,That’s a good point. My time is much too valuable. You know perhaps I should find someone to do it for me. You know someone with a rudimentary understanding of science but whose real talents lie in menial labour.
15218,Sheldon,Given your community college education I encourage you to ask me as many as possible.
15219,Leonard,I just want to talk to her.
15220,Howard,Anyway any ideas on a gift?
15221,Sheldon,It actually says at least?
15222,Raj,What do we do now?
15223,Sheldon,Yes but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring.
15224,Leonard,I did a bad thing.
15225,Sheldon,Sad.
15227,Sheldon,For instance?
15229,Sheldon,I fear Penny is being unfaithful to Leonard.
15230,Leonard,Oh great. Do that.
15231,Sheldon,Stop it. Stop celebrating me.
15232,Sheldon,Keep filling this one with babies. She’s good.
15233,Sheldon,I can’t believe it.
15234,Sheldon,I was humiliated on national radio. How do you think I’m doing?
15235,Raj,I didn’t crash it okay? My playlist was too up-tempo I got light-headed and I fell off. Okay. It all comes down to this.
15236,Raj,I can’t believe they let him into Canada.
15237,Leonard,Oh that’s not who I am.
15238,Howard,In a New Delhi minute.
15239,Penny,Well yeah.
15240,Penny,Oh thanks. I found this place in Alhambra. It’s in a woman’s basement. I think it’s a front
15241,Howard,But I also upset Sheldon and he’s not gonna want to come over if I’m there.
15242,Penny,Oh okay all right you know what? I’ll tell you what happened. We were young we were very much in love but we could only communicate through a time-traveling mailbox at my lake house.
15243,Leonard,Thank you Amy.
15244,Raj,Do you know if you look at Austria on a map it actually looks like a wiener?
15245,Leonard,I know but you’re going to be a TV star and you haven’t left me yet. That takes guts.
15246,Sheldon,Killing you? I can’t breathe.
15247,Howard,I just got an e-mail from my ex-girlfriend Lucy. She misses me and wants to get together.
15248,Leonard,And we live here so we have no choice.
15249,Penny,Leonard will you just let me handle this please? Look let’s just… Sheldon please
15250,Howard,Oh well that’s the best part.
15251,Sheldon,Don’t talk to me as if nothing’s happened between us. And yes it sure is buddy.
15252,Howard,Yeah but it’s probably difficult to pronounce.
15253,Sheldon,I don’t think you’re fully aware of the ramifications here Leonard.
15254,Raj,I’m sorry.
15255,Penny,Hey.
15256,Howard,I’m an astrophysicist. The stars don’t take a day off.
15257,Leonard,Uh I kind of have a problem I was hoping you could help me with.
15258,Leonard,Uh I’m just gonna be honest with the guy.
15259,Sheldon,I smell funny. I taste salty.
15260,Leonard,You know guys come onto her all the time so you need to like set yourself apart. You know be a little shy don’t make too much eye contact. And you know treat her with like cool detachment and and and you know fear.
15261,Raj,You went to Emily’s to apologise and when you left she was crying.
15262,Raj,Star Trek V!
15263,Penny,Like what? Yeah yeah I see you you’re making a little cheque sign in the air I got it just hold your horses. What does Leonard complain about?
15264,Raj,Uh this is my friend Sheldon. Sheldon this is Emily.
15265,Sheldon,You wouldn’t.
15266,Leonard,Maybe it’s a shipping problem.
15267,Leonard,I don’t know what you’re talking about.
15268,Penny,You’re kidding right? We’re not just gonna get drunk and go on rides?
15269,Sheldon,I said funny.
15270,Leonard,They sell out incredibly fast but as long as one of us gets in we can buy passes…
15271,Leonard,We came to apologize.
15272,Penny,Gosh he’s kind of a sore loser isn’t he?
15274,Penny,Oh son of a bitch.
15275,Leonard,Well it’s not really a great time. Penny and I have some things we need to talk about.
15276,Sheldon,That’s my girl. What on earth? What is going on?
15277,Sheldon,Here we have a highly gifted researcher in the field of particle physics whose work has brought him to the precipice of forever changing mankind’s understanding of the universe. AKA me. And here we have a waitress brushing her teeth with her finger. AKA you.
15278,Sheldon,Hamburgers and lemonade.
15279,Sheldon,You sound surprised. Mmm hou zi shui zai li du. 
15280,Leonard,No.
15281,Sheldon,We tried. His assistant said he was on sabbatical. Although we distinctly heard his office window open and shut.
15282,Leonard,Yeah just nice and easy right over the plate.
15283,Sheldon,Uh I’m in Kingman Arizona and uh I need you to come pick me up.
15284,Raj,I’m listening.
15285,Leonard,Who’s Frank and Alicia?
15286,Penny,Okay does everyone remember the rules? If he’s shirtless one sip. Posing with a pet two sips. Pet and shirtless chug like it’s your job. And pull.
15287,Penny,Hi. I’m sorry to bother you guys but you’ve got to come take your Sheldon back.
15288,Leonard,Not like a date a date.
15289,Sheldon,I think what most upsets me about it Mother is the hypocrisy. Doesn’t this contradict all the religious rules you’ve been espousing your whole life?
15290,Leonard,Buddy wh do you realize that that also means 699999 people don’t die?
15291,Leonard,I guess he just hates fun.
15292,Sheldon,Come on. Click the mouse with me.
15293,Penny,Sit over there.
15294,Sheldon,Sheldon Cooper does not cry.
15295,Howard,Come on come on you haven’t even heard it yet. Leonard give me a beat.
15296,Leonard,Oh yeah. But doesn’t that fix the problem you’ve been having?
15297,Leonard,Yeah okay sure no problem why don’t we just figure out where we’re going and when we want to get there and then rate of speed equals distance over time. Solve for R.
15298,Penny,You want an acting lesson?
15299,Sheldon,Well now do you see the problem?
15300,Penny,True dat?
15301,Leonard,I’m… uh… in a… I’m in a radiation suit. What’s up?
15302,Leonard,Actually to this day she’s never really said it.
15303,Howard,Yeah bye.
15304,Howard,Yeah you…
15305,Leonard,Hey ready for lunch?
15306,Sheldon,I was going to get my mail.
15307,Leonard,Very hard.
15308,Leonard,I got all your favourites. Beer wings sliders. We can watch the football game. I even painted my stomach.
15309,Penny,Something got you down there Sheldon?
15310,Penny,You guys look like you’re having fun.
15311,Sheldon,Oh in that case I’d like to be partnered with my good friend Howard.
15312,Raj,Thank you.
15313,Leonard,Howard do you want to double-check the equatorial mount on the laser? We need it locked onto the Sea of Tranquility.
15314,Penny,Yeah for future reference that’s a while.
15315,Sheldon,Oh dear Lord shush.
15316,Sheldon,Why would I see her again? I already have a dentist. 
15317,Sheldon,Tell her about the uranium. Tell her about the uranium.
15318,Sheldon,You want to go to pottery barn first?
15319,Sheldon,Ah. Yeah I had to get a little creative because the S R and M keys on my laptop stopped working.
15320,Penny,Fine. You?
15321,Raj,Well you start off by trying to make chocolate souffle and when it falls you panic quickly change the name and voila! Lava cake.
15322,Sheldon,You know I don’t just say smart things about science. I also yodel. 
15323,Penny,Where’d you get that from?
15324,Raj,No Sheldon’s right. Emily did say I always talk about my feelings too much.
15325,Howard,Well if that’s the case Penny will have to get satellite TV and maybe once a week run a vacuum through this place.
15326,Leonard,It’ll be fine. People have kids every day. You’ll figure this out.
15327,Leonard,I wasn’t staring!
15328,Penny,Two Weeks to Rock Hard Abs.
15329,Leonard,That was fast.
15330,Sheldon,Is that your son?
15331,Sheldon,Hmm no. One slip of the hand and suddenly I’m sitting in the Engineering Department building doodads with Wolowitz.
15332,Leonard,It’s great. I love it.
15333,Leonard,Oh. Like Jaws 4 Indiana Jones 4 Daredevil 1.
15334,Sheldon,Yes.
15335,Raj,Wait what happened to us?
15336,Sheldon,Leonard I don’t see how I could have made it any simpler.
15337,Leonard,You know I do have a way to get him out of our hair. I’ve been holding onto this for a few years but maybe now’s the time.
15338,Penny,That is the least sexy thing anyone’s ever said to me.
15339,Penny,What is that about?
15340,Raj,Well you’re very pretty. That could be intimidating to another woman.
15341,Penny,Oh right sorry.
15342,Sheldon,So you agree with my friends that I should skip the premiere?
15343,Howard,You know Adam West is my favourite Batman? Well after Michael Keaton Christian Bale and Batman from The Lego Movie.
15344,Raj,Oh well I was going to spend the night with my special little lady but uh she got worms and then I had to take her to the vet.
15345,Leonard,Yes.
15346,Sheldon,Well Howard what about you?
15347,Leonard,Look I get it this is still my room we haven’t really made it yours.
15349,Howard,Oh I’m gonna do a pre-cry before I go in there. Really dry myself out.
15350,Howard,Now can we have cookies and Hawaiian Punch?
15351,Penny,Sheldon would you like to come in?
15352,Raj,I know. Powerful stuff huh?
15353,Sheldon,Well I believe I’ve done it. And I’m only saying believe to sound modest because sweet Sam Houston I did it.
15354,Leonard,No.
15355,Leonard,Uh Sheldon?
15356,Sheldon,Well now don’t get defensive. You’re oddly-shaped but you got the girl.
15357,Leonard,What choice did the university have? He snapped. It happens to theoretical physicists all the time.
15358,Raj,He’s always been very cagey about what he puts in his egg salad to make it so tasty.
15359,Sheldon,Penny did you ever wonder how Starfleet captains…
15360,Penny,Hey! Look at Leonard in his fancy-ass grownup clothes. Way to go Priya. For once he doesn’t look like a mannequin in the boys’ department. Hey did he tell you I saved the silk shirt?
15361,Penny,Really?
15362,Sheldon,Perhaps. But they might ask me something else.
15363,Sheldon,Adversity is to be expected. Continue.
15364,Penny,What?
15365,Leonard,We can’t ask Leslie Winkle.
15366,Penny,What’s going on?
15367,Sheldon,There’s one more zero. You forgot the time parameter.
15368,Penny,Come on Sheldon. There are plenty of smart people who don’t have mental problems.
15369,Sheldon,This is Stan Lee’s front door. We were on Stan Lee’s curb then we were on Stan Lee’s walk and now we’re at Stan Lee’s front door.
15370,Leonard,The Fifth Annual East Rutherford New Jersey Gay Lesbian Bisexual and Transgender Alliance Luau.
15371,Sheldon,Interesting fact in Italian the morta in mortadella means death.
15372,Raj,Sheldon we’re really sorry.
15373,Leonard,I’m not afraid of him.
15374,Howard,What do you mean?
15375,Sheldon,Well what can we do to cheer you up?
15376,Leonard,The Newcomb medal.
15377,Raj,Oh uh come in come in. Oh I uh I didn’t think I was going to get to see you until tomorrow.
15378,Leonard,That’s Penny’s ex-boyfriend.
15379,Sheldon,Nope. 
15380,Leonard,Um I guarantee you’ll be the prettiest girl there.
15381,Sheldon,I’m not quite sure. It involves a part of the human experience that has always eluded me.
15382,Sheldon,I feel so betrayed. You know all my life I thought Uncle Sam was a friendly uncle who brought you presents. Turns out he’s the other kind.
15383,Leonard,Sheldon I’m sorry I didn’t tell you about the surgery but you were worried about nothing.
15384,Sheldon,None of you will get it. It’s Eisenhower.
15385,Leonard,It’s not about money.
15386,Sheldon,Uh peace out!
15387,Leonard,No he’s crazy. Sometimes crazy looks like sad so it’ll suck you back in.
15388,Howard,Amy told me you were concerned that I might be too passive and shy. Let me ask you something. Would a passive guy barge in here to look you in the eye and say hey dew-kissed flower what’s up?
15389,Leonard,No she’s real.
15390,Penny,That was supposed to be for the whole floor.
15391,Raj,Oh boy.
15392,Sheldon,Her reasoning is unassailable. It is one o’clock.
15393,Howard,Uh she’s seeing me.
15394,Leonard,Well you don’t go into science for the money.
15395,Howard,Then let go of the ring and go.
15396,Penny,Yes.
15397,Sheldon,No I’m not all right. It’s been six days since I was supposed to get a haircut and nothing horrible has happened.
15398,Leonard,I can’t believe he’s friends with Elizabeth Plimpton.
15399,Penny,No sorry.
15400,Raj,Leonard and Howard don’t have a flat. They went to the movies. Look.
15401,Penny,No that won’t work.
15402,Raj,Well here’s your key back.
15403,Leonard,You are a dirty girl.
15404,Raj,The Fantastic Four reunited.
15405,Sheldon,Ooh. Bad move.
15406,Howard,Do you like living with her?
15407,Penny,Hi.
15408,Sheldon,Oh. Fair enough.
15409,Sheldon,I was not myself. I had lost a lot of thumb blood.
15410,Raj,Dude if I was wearing a bra I’d throw it at your head right now.
15411,Raj,Well I can’t eat like a ten-year-old all the time.
15412,Penny,Sweetie I know you think jokes like that are funny but do you really think you could handle making out with both of us?
15413,Sheldon,Dibs.
15414,Sheldon,Hmm. Living or dead?
15415,Raj,Can I squirt the ultrasound jelly on your stomach?
15416,Sheldon,This package came while you were at work.
15417,Howard,Anyway I was hoping I could uh pick your brains a little. I’m supposed to take Lucy out Friday and I need a killer first date.
15418,Leonard,Just ask another one.
15419,Sheldon,He’s in my spot. Leonard make him stop being naked in my spot.
15420,Leonard,Uh Professor Hawking if you just give us one second we’ll light the candles and we can all sing together.
15421,Howard,How come on Star Trek everybody’s private parts are the same. No alien lady ever told Captain Kirk hey get your thing out of my nose.
15422,Leonard,You uh moving into the apartment on the fifth floor?
15423,Leonard,Okay we’ll take ’em. But I swear if it’s Will Smith in Shark Tale 2 it better be at least as good as the original.
15424,Penny,If you want I can get ready in five minutes.
15425,Penny,Oh Sheldon are these letters from your grandmother?
15426,Sheldon,Thank you Arthur. You are the wisest of the wise.
15427,Penny,I know.
15428,Howard,That’s because you keep trying to stick pencils in it.
15429,Raj,Mm true. I do feel guilty about him.
15430,Leonard,Yeah that’s the only thing wrong with that plan.
15431,Sheldon,No Oh it actually is if you get the joke. It’s based on the premise that Princeton isn’t a very good school.
15432,Sheldon,I told you.
15433,Penny,I’m gonna need another clue.
15434,Howard,Did that feel good? You feel like a big man now?
15435,Leonard,I didn’t betray Penny.
15436,Sheldon,All right you were on Jeopardy. Allow me to Alex Trebek this and put it in the form of a question Who has been a complete waste of our time?
15437,Sheldon,What?
15438,Howard,That’s that’s very nice of you. Uh come come. Come on in.
15439,Penny,Well what do you want us to do?
15440,Raj,A Romulan battle bagel?
15441,Leonard,Calm down. I’m getting out. I have something I want to give you.
15442,Leonard,Um little bit.  What?
15443,Howard,One more time?
15444,Sheldon,Professor Proton was never late when he was on TV. You know every day four o’clock he was there. Unless tornadoes were ripping apart East Texas in which case we’d join him in progress.  It’s him. Hello. Well I see. Yes. All right we can come get you. Yeah well see you soon. Bye.
15446,Raj,Ooh this is exciting. We’re innovating. I feel like we’re in the Facebook movie.
15447,Leonard,Why isn’t this bothering you? Isn’t your brain getting itchy? This is on your card. This could be ruining your credit score. Why isn’t this making you crazy?
15448,Howard,Of course. Please come in.
15449,Howard,Maybe I won’t settle down. Maybe I’ll just play the field.
15450,Sheldon,What can I say you know? She enjoys my genitals. I am giving them to her on a nightly basis.
15451,Penny,For the record not your worst opening line.
15452,Sheldon,And me.
15453,Penny,Oh what a cute little store. Everybody’s staring at me.
15454,Sheldon,No I sit there.
15455,Howard,Oh no. Hey.
15456,Leonard,I mean I was on fire. I I was in the zone like an athlete.
15457,Sheldon,I want a different question.
15458,Sheldon,There is a fine line between wrong and visionary. Unfortunately you have to be a visionary to see it.
15459,Sheldon,You know Leonard that’s actually a valid idea. Very good.
15460,Raj,Sounds like a plan.
15461,Leonard,Listen I don’t want to be rude but Priya’s gonna be calling any minute so…
15462,Leonard,I’m sorry so you never went outside?
15463,Raj,How dare you. Aishwarya Rai is a Goddess. By comparison Madhuri Dixit is a leprous prostitute.
15464,Penny,Why did you ask if I had one too?
15465,Sheldon,Of course I’m listening. Blah blah hopeless Penny delusion blah blah blah.
15466,Penny,We’re back.
15467,Penny,Even more not what you think.
15468,Sheldon,Those are very wise words.
15469,Sheldon,Can you believe they planned a trip to Las Vegas and didn’t invite me?
15470,Howard,Find new friends.
15471,Sheldon,All right. This is on you. Amy and I are living together in sin like a couple of New Yorkers. Now while you scold us I’m going to get a knife and a fork. Joe may be sloppy but Sheldon’s not.
15472,Howard,What? I’m giving myself dramatic entrance music. People will know I’m awesome and to be feared.
15473,Leonard,Uh-huh. Look at the comments.
15474,Penny,Okay look sweetie we all love Sheldon but you’ve been with him over a year now. If it’s not going anywhere what does it hurt to look around?
15475,Raj,Congrats.
15476,Sheldon,There was a large plant in the lobby. It kept looking like the outside.
15477,Howard,So don’t do it.
15478,Howard,Well that didn’t go your way.
15479,Leonard,Oh Gas-X has a new ultra strength. I guess they really do read their mail.
15480,Leonard,What are you gonna do Sheldon blow up the apartment?
15481,Sheldon,Hello. Listen I’ve been thinking a lot about relationships and how difficult they can be and I think…
15482,Leonard,You called the police because someone hacked your World of Warcraft account?
15483,Leonard,Come on you didn’t even try.
15484,Penny,Yeah this is none of my business. But why did you break up with him in an e-mail?
15485,Leonard,Oh I’m not sure we should.
15486,Leonard,Can’t be very long.
15487,Sheldon,Oh yeah this is it.
15488,Sheldon,You don’t have to sell me on cats Leonard. I’m already a fan. All right fellas who’s in the mood for Fancy Feast? Well that’s not fancy at all.
15489,Penny,Keep talking about Captain Kirk and we’re all gonna stop.
15490,Penny,Yeah and you certainly don’t have to earn my love.
15493,Howard,Guys this person’s just going out of their way to get a rise out of you.
15494,Leonard,You’ve got to be kidding me. You friended Stuart on Facebook?
15495,Sheldon,Oh yes. So the point of this exercise is for you to find someone to copulate with?
15496,Sheldon,Despite what her Bible says recent archaeological studies indicate that although camels are referenced in the Old Testament they didn’t exist in the Middle East until hundreds of years later.
15497,Sheldon,We ate. She lectured me on the link between gum disease and heart attacks nothing I didn’t already know and I came home.
15498,Raj,He just went colon capital O.
15499,Leonard,The bastard teleported.
15500,Sheldon,Not true. Leonard made me like you. And let me tell you that was a hard row to hoe. Cheers pal. Ooh. Boy that is a treat that’s hard to beat. Get the Mad Hatter on the horn I’m having a tea party.
15501,Leonard,Merry Christmas.
15503,Raj,You’d think it’d be because my parents didn’t love me but actually they loved me a great deal.
15504,Leonard,That’s great but the Air Force approved the specs. We’re good to go.
15505,Penny,Well let’s find out.
15506,Raj,Really? You kept sending me apartment listings.
15507,Penny,Well we’re your best friends give us one more detail and we promise we’ll leave you alone.
15508,Leonard,O-o-o-o-h! Again?
15509,Sheldon,You’re asking me to keep a secret?
15510,Leonard,I wish there were more.
15511,Sheldon,Well I think we’re off to a terrific start.
15512,Leonard,Ah. Technically yes but if you’ll notice it’s reversible. So it works as two.
15513,Sheldon,Come on! Don’t nitpick!
15514,Penny,Hey Sheldon.
15515,Leonard,And we let them think that we decided to just be friends and that everything’s cool.
15516,Leonard,Really?
15517,Penny,Yeah! Letting Sheldon use you to manipulate me? I thought you were my friend.
15518,Sheldon,You know what let me pull a quick contract off the Internet.
15519,Sheldon,Da-da-da da-da dum boink boink.
15520,Howard,You will?
15521,Sheldon,And how would I do that?
15522,Howard,No.
15523,Leonard,Well if he does I’ll see if my bear has a friend.
15524,Sheldon,Uh no thank you. We now know why MasterCard sent me a fraud alert.
15525,Sheldon,Never that’s the problem. I need your help.
15526,Howard,Hang on. Okay. Given the choice of anyone in the world whom would you want as a dinner guest?
15527,Raj,Okay yup. See see that that looks like that looks like they could be bigger. But you know I bet I bet when I do it mine do the same thing.
15528,Sheldon,It was a lot more than that. You helped me work out the masses of all the fermions and you pumiced my hammer toe. How can I ever repay you?
15529,Howard,How are you gonna get James Earl Jones?
15530,Sheldon,The thought of you sitting in a darkened theatre with a character like Stuart is repellent. No offence Stuart.
15531,Sheldon,It’s because I’m annoying right? I know it is. Say it. Say it. Say I’m annoying.
15532,Leonard,He tried to score with Penny.
15533,Sheldon,Yeah I felt the same way about the platypus. You know bird and mammal in the same creature? No way. And spoiler way.
15534,Sheldon,That’s because he drinks too much soy milk.
15535,Leonard,Oh. Thank you Raj. I’d be honoured.
15536,Raj,I call it the Mario and Luigi but whatever. Hey how’s Sheldon doing?
15537,Leonard,Yeah it’s like regular boggle but in Klingon. That’s probably enough about us tell us about you.
15538,Sheldon,And is this my card? Rats! I wonder if Howard used a radioactive tracer. Where am I going to find Uranium-235 this time of night? Come on Craigslist.
15539,Howard,Listen I love your charming racist humour but any chance you could not knock my religion while she’s here.
15540,Penny,Hi! 
15541,Penny,Oh come on Raj not even a little bit?
15542,Sheldon,In here you’ll find emergency provisions. An eight-day supply of food and water a crossbow season two of Star Trek The Original Series on a high-density flash drive.
15543,Howard,Did you get a cold too?
15544,Leonard,Oh I’m sorry.
15545,Leonard,No. Lactose. Gas.
15546,Howard,The only person allowed inside this head is Dr. Phil. Anyway I I spoke to my new lady friend about meeting you all and she thought it would be easier for her to start with just one.
15547,Sheldon,Are you suggesting that you’ve come to your senses and wish to re-establish the mutual benefits that stem from full participation in the roommate agreement?
15548,Penny,Got it.
15549,Sheldon,Hmm. Let’s see what do I know about Amy? She loves medieval literature Chaucer’s her favourite. And her eyes sparkle when she watches old French movies. I enjoy how harp music causes her fingers to dance as if she’s playing along.
15550,Howard,Dude come on.
15551,Howard,Oh hey thanks for letting me use the comic book store as part of the scavenger hunt.
15552,Leonard,You know this can go on all night why don’t you just come with us?
15553,Penny,Tell me about it.
15554,Sheldon,I can’t because that was a lie. Yours was broken in an earthquake. And that’s a lie.
15555,Howard,And then after coffee we went for a walk and she told me she always thought people from India were exotic and mysterious. So with my mouth I said we’re just like anybody else but with my eyes I said straight up Red hop on my flying carpet.
15556,Leonard,Trust me it doesn’t.
15557,Howard,That is so generous of you. I’d like to switch sides.
15558,Penny,You know there’s a cabin in Big Bear that a doctor I work with keeps offering me.
15559,Penny,A hugging machine?
15560,Penny,You know if anything he’s turning me into his mother. Before I did pharmaceutical sales I was an actress. You know I was pretty good. You know girl-next-door type but hot. Doable.
15561,Leonard,Since when don’t you knock? It’s like the only good thing about you.
15562,Leonard,So I had to take Sheldon to the dentist this morning.
15563,Raj,Good talk.
15564,Leonard,And it’s gone.
15565,Howard,I’m not telling. I’m from Asia. I’m mysterious. Deal with it.
15566,Penny,No it isn’t they are extremely boring. I mean how do you not kill yourself like every day? Anyway I decided I don’t need to be a scientist I could just look like one. So I bought these.
15567,Raj,But we’ll have sex first right?
15568,Leonard,Other people would say “why not?”
15569,Howard,Except on a date with anybody.
15570,Leonard,No please we insist it’s the least we can do considering.
15571,Sheldon,It’s asymptotically free partons inside a quark-gluon plasma.
15572,Leonard,Hang on. Hang on. Uh-huh. Okay thank you. Howard was on his scooter and got hit by a truck. He’s in critical condition.
15573,Raj,It’s easy. The spider’s crawling up your arm.
15574,Sheldon,Super Mario Bros. theme?
15575,Sheldon,Oh no. What have I done?
15576,Sheldon,No.
15577,Sheldon,Huh that’s exactly what Leonard Wolowitz Koothrappali Bernadette and Penny said.
15578,Penny,Well that that’s good. I’m glad you came to that. But before you do let me just ask you a big picture question.
15579,Sheldon,Radiation burns. A little mishap while I was building my own cat scanner.
15580,Penny,Oh so I spent seventh grade dotting my I’s with little asses? Cool.
15581,Leonard,Right.
15582,Raj,Oh they only have Thursday and Sunday passes left.
15583,Leonard,Yeah we did our own search.
15584,Howard,I wonder how they smell.
15585,Leonard,It’s whatever. Ten eleven dollars.
15586,Sheldon,I’m making petrie dishes to grow throat cultures.
15587,Howard,Not the brush part just the little rubber thing to pick food from my teeth and massage my gums.
15588,Raj,Of course you do. Who could forget being that fat?
15589,Raj,Right okay. What are you doing tomorrow preevning?
15590,Raj,Oh I’m not on the patent. I’m just here because there’s a bumblebee in my office.
15591,Leonard,It’s cute that you think that. Don’t worry about it.
15592,Howard,Yes exactly. Where is the coin? Why don’t you look in your pockets? I slipped them in there earlier today.
15593,Howard,And he’s all white.
15594,Penny,It’s weird.
15595,Leonard,Yeah we all are.
15596,Penny,Huh well that’s handy. Um here’s a question why?
15597,Howard,What?
15598,Raj,I don’t want to say.
15599,Sheldon,Because the word secretary has fallen into disrepute. FYI my mother’s birthday is coming up. I’m going to need you to pick up a present.
15600,Sheldon,Pick a card Sheldon. Now look at it and put it back in the deck. Now do you remember your card? Of course I do I have an eidetic memory. My apologies. Now shuffle the cards. Shuffling. Wait here. Processing image cross-referencing.
15601,Penny,Anime. You know I knew a girl in high school named Anna May. Anna May Fletcher. She was born with one nostril. Then she had this bad nose job and basically wound up with three.
15602,Leonard,Hi Amy.
15603,Leonard,Maybe in the morning.
15604,Howard,I’m the astrophysicist. Astro means space.
15605,Penny,Sheldon honey aren’t you getting a little carried away? I mean it’s just a toy robot.
15606,Raj,Race riots?
15607,Leonard,No.
15608,Leonard,Did you try calling her on the telephone?
15609,Howard,Don’t say that. I mean you’re not Dame Judi Dench but you’re pretty great.
15611,Leonard,She stuck a needle into my hand!
15612,Leonard,Right right. You’re saying you talked to Penny?
15613,Raj,Well let’s see. Yup three missed calls.
15614,Penny,Are you high?
15615,Penny,It doesn’t matter. Look I promise from now on I will keep my distance from you.
15616,Leonard,Oh yeah. Fifth grade. Sixth grade. Seventh grade. Eighth grade. Ninth grade.
15617,Sheldon,If your bathroom floor counts as a carry-on you’re packed.
15618,Howard,Then the robot uprising has begun.
15619,Sheldon,For the record he also thinks the Walgreens and the dry cleaners are out of this world.
15620,Sheldon,Ah gravity thou art a heartless bitch.
15621,Sheldon,There’s an argument for that. But I want to make sure.
15622,Penny,Thanks for clearing that up.
15623,Leonard,Oh thanks man.
15624,Leonard,Hey you know who’d really dig seeing this experiment? Penny.
15625,Sheldon,Oh how nice. Maybe they can carpool when they visit you in federal prison.
15626,Sheldon,Wow. A Death Star cake.
15627,Leonard,That will do Raj straight for the tank.
15628,Penny,Uh pretty much why?
15629,Raj,I’m the new Homo in town. That came out wrong.
15630,Sheldon,What good is having a girlfriend if you can’t unload your psychological sewage on her?
15631,Sheldon,Good.
15632,Howard,Why?
15633,Leonard,Okay um well look it’s just that things between you and me have been going pretty quick.
15634,Raj,Don’t worry. Everything I have I share with her. Including my friend Leon…
15635,Leonard,Sounds like a wise man.
15636,Sheldon,Bilurrrbe.
15637,Penny,Oh I didn’t tell you? You’re banished from the Cheesecake Factory.
15638,Penny,Right thanks.
15639,Leonard,Would you just relax?
15640,Leonard,Oh he’s the Doppler Effect.
15641,Penny,Alright singer who sang “Oops I Did It Again.”  Okay Tweetie Bird taught he taw a what?
15642,Penny,Well it’s got to be one or the other which is it?
15643,Sheldon,We can’t have Thai food we had Indian for lunch.
15644,Sheldon,Isn’t that the best? She’s like Grandma Spider-Man.
15645,Leonard,Come on. Wolowitz won’t come out of his house and we need him for a robot battle.
15646,Howard,Don’t worry. Everything’s fine.
15647,Howard,But he’s right Papa listen to him.  You! You are the one who ruined everything!
15648,Penny,No I’m into it I’m into it. Just there’s so much pressure to make the night special and it never works out.
15649,Howard,But I have a cream sherry hangover and I smell blintzes.
15650,Penny,Wouldn’t help. Zack can’t even spell NPR.
15651,Sheldon,By challenging you to a duel.
15652,Raj,I… I do enjoy the La Brea Tar Pits.
15653,Howard,No. Oh is he anything like uh Mun-Mun the Mongoose? He taught us not to play with cobras.
15654,Sheldon,Well I’ll just Google hot dark and moist see what comes up.
15655,Leonard,Guys excuse me not that calling one of the Avengers isn’t a perfectly reasonable choice but we’re scientists. Don’t you think we can figure this out using actual science?
15656,Leonard,Yeah okay I see him. It looks like they’re having a nice time. I wish I could hear what they’re saying.
15657,Sheldon,Hmm. Yeah you’re right. It’s like when I first encountered the Pythagorean theorem. You know I was blown away that the square of the hypotenuse was the sum of the squares of the opposite sides. But now I’m just like eh.
15658,Leonard,That’s great you guys have to go.
15659,Leonard,What is this?
15660,Leonard,Really? LeVar Burton’s coming here?
15661,Leonard,No.
15662,Sheldon,Are you ill?
15663,Penny,Okay there you go Sultry Sunrise Red. What do you think?
15664,Penny,You’re an even better husband.
15665,Sheldon,I tried reaching out to my mother but she was in Bible study. Leonard’s mother is on a book tour. My Mee-Maw was taking a nap and after a while Siri started repeating her answers.
15666,Leonard,That’s your system?
15669,Penny, Sheldon.
15670,Leonard,Sure. .
15671,Howard,Stuart settle an argument for us. Who would win Billy the Kid or the White Wizard?
15672,Leonard,What for?
15673,Leonard,How?
15674,Penny,Believable? You saying I’m not smart?
15675,Sheldon,A powerful laxative.
15676,Raj,Actually I have to tell you something. These kind of movies really aren’t my thing so last night I watched it just to see what I was getting myself into.
15677,Sheldon,Hulk sad.
15678,Leonard,I don’t know. Maybe they’ll call Imperial Officers to take us to a holding cell on the Death Star.
15679,Howard,You’re useless.
15680,Sheldon,Are you sure? ‘Cause I’m feeling a twinge.
15681,Penny,Hey where are you?
15682,Howard,Don’t you even feel a little bad sponging off your friends?
15683,Sheldon,You actually had it right in the first place. Once again you’ve fallen for one of my classic pranks. Bazinga! Well now here’s a peculiar e-mail. The president of the university wants me to meet him at his office tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.
15684,Leonard,Oh you know what? I’m not going.
15685,Sheldon,And your father? Alive?
15686,Raj,We could cut it into thirds.
15687,Sheldon,Leonard have you gotten married yet?
15688,Raj,Screw that! I sat on the floor for seven years. I’m staying right here.
15689,Penny,I don’t care I’m finishing it put him down.
15690,Sheldon,Oh don’t be silly. Christmas is a bunch of baloney created by the tinsel industry. Why is this so important to you?
15691,Leonard,No.
15692,Raj,It’s on like Alderaan.
15693,Leonard,You brought your husband to work you know the rules. Meesa thinking yousa looking pretty sad now too betcha betcha.
15694,Leonard,Yeah how about that? See you soon.
15696,Penny,Well yeah. Why?
15697,Sheldon,You know I’ve always wanted to go to a goth nighclub.
15698,Sheldon,Are you monitoring your circadian rhythms in order to identify your periods of maximum mental acuity? I did that one summer. Ah youth.
15699,Raj,Is it even possible to get this done in two months?
15700,Raj,What? I’m giving myself dramatic entrance music. People will know I’m awesome and to be feared.
15702,Sheldon,Oh that makes sense ’cause she’s gone and you miss her.
15703,Sheldon,Ooh that sounds fun. Now we’re talking about real treats right? Not Bible verses like my mother used to give me.
15704,Sheldon,Interesting. Well so I was right.
15705,Sheldon,I told you. Buying scalped tickets is against the rules. If you get caught you get banned from Comic-Con for life. Life Leonard. You’re gonna feel pretty silly when we’re 80 years old and you have to drive me down there and then wait in the car for three days.
15706,Raj,Sure.
15707,Howard,Yeah I think so. Do you have any advice?
15708,Leonard,That’s ridiculous. 
15709,Sheldon,Well then I guess it’s plausible. Hang on a second mister.
15710,Raj,Not cool.
15711,Penny,Well do you guys ever fight over money?
15712,Raj,What were you doing with Priya?
15713,Sheldon, Leonard and Penny.
15714,Leonard,Why not?
15715,Penny,I can’t believe you have to fill out a preschool application for an infant.
15717,Leonard,Congratulations.
15718,Penny,Alright Kurt be nice.
15719,Sheldon,Well there’s some value to taking a multivitamin but the human body can only absorb so much what you’re buying here are the ingredients for very expensive urine.
15720,Sheldon,That’s amusing I was going to say that about M.I.T. but it works for Princeton too.
15721,Raj,I’ll take the job. See you Monday.
15722,Raj,Yeah no but it is basic human nature. If we present him as a prize maybe they would.
15723,Penny,Oh tell us.
15724,Raj,Excuse me I have selective mutism a recognized medical disorder. You’re just a douche.
15726,Sheldon,I came to go over your alibi for last night.
15727,Sheldon,No it’s mine.
15728,Leonard,Uh-huh. Now that Raj is working for Sheldon I don’t have to chauffeur him around anymore. Plus yeah with them working late so much we get some privacy.
15729,Raj,Can we please get back to the game?
15730,Howard,No no speak up. I’m about to use the blender and I don’t want to miss anything.
15731,Sheldon,Based on what happened next I assume it means “would you like an enema?”
15732,Howard,Hey Leonard when you’re done we came up with a bunch more.
15733,Raj,And I can put it in your office?
15734,Sheldon,Oh. Bye.
15735,Sheldon,Hang on. Physics Today mentioned the paper.
15736,Raj,Okay well how about this? From the university Web site 7pm to 10pm Norton Hall Multipurpose Room mixer for grad students and faculty of the science and humanities departments. Whether you split atoms or infinitives this is the place to be.
15737,Leonard,Not the kind of illness that will make her want to come over and take care of me but nothing so critical that she’ll feel uncomfortable going out with me in the future if I want to try this again.
15738,Sheldon,I do.
15739,Leonard,I thought you had plans with Amy.
15740,Sheldon,Amy is studying the time lag between intent and awareness and I realized that applies to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. Now I recognize there will be a time lag between me saying that and you Googling what it means so I’ll wait.
15741,Penny,You want to know the most pathetic part? Even though I hate his lying cheating guts I still love him. Is that crazy?
15743,Raj,Yeah sorry for clicking on that.
15744,Sheldon,W-W-Wait. There’s still four more verses. You don’t sing a song and not finish it. Hither page and stand by me if thou know’st it telling. Yonder peasant who is he? Where and what his dwelling? Brightly shone the moon that night though the frost…
15745,Leonard,Oh she’s a doctor.
15746,Penny,Run.
15747,Raj,You’re right let’s talk again in a few days.
15748,Leonard,You can stop smiling now.
15749,Sheldon,Well Penny who’s smarter the wise man or the person who comes to him for advice?
15750,Sheldon,I can’t do that. What if he serves haggis and blood pudding?
15751,Raj,What do you mean?
15753,Sheldon,Yes there’s nothing quite like the slightly widened eyes of mildly startled.
15754,Sheldon,What’s not to love?
15755,Penny,What did it say?
15756,Leonard,We’re fine Sheldon.
15757,Raj,Like a business manager?
15758,Leonard,No I don’t think so. Although Penny did say exactly that.
15759,Leonard,Hello Lesley.
15760,Raj,I’m sorry. We can’t all eat whatever we want and still stay thin. Wait in the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy isn’t forty-three the answer to the question of life the universeand everything?
15761,Penny,What is this?
15762,Raj,Well are you talking about when he thought he was real?
15763,Howard,It’s interesting your father didn’t help around the house and Howard doesn’t help either so in a way Howard’s not only like your father but he’s also like the child that you’re afraid to have.
15764,Leonard,No I do not have a sarcasm sign.
15766,Sheldon,Now give me that cookie I discovered an element.
15767,Leonard,Shut up Howard. Sheldon we have to do this.
15768,Sheldon,No I gave it to her well. Now over here I was thinking the turbulence could be reduced if we just put…
15769,Sheldon,And is that lipstick on your cheek and neck.
15770,Penny,It’s stupid.
15771,Sheldon,Oh certainly. Uh when I was eight years old Billy Sparks cornered me in the playground. I asked myself what would Spock do? Then I grabbed Billy on his shoulder and performed my first Vulcan nerve pinch.
15772,Sheldon,Oh jiminy that’s cold.
15773,Raj,Why do you have to make everything so filthy? Why couldn’t you just say the blog is like her giving me the key to her heart?
15774,Penny,Oh good I guessed right.
15775,Penny,Hey.
15776,Sheldon,I was 14 and graduating summa cum laude from college. Summa cum laude is Latin for with highest honours.
15777,Raj,Ooh gossip. When I first got here I thought you Americans really gossiped around the water cooler. So I hung out there for like a month but the only gossip I ever heard was about some creepy guy hanging out by the water cooler.
15778,Howard,So I guess what I’m saying is I get where Lucy’s coming from.
15780,Howard,Okay I’m good.
15781,Leonard,Yeah. It’s wonderful. Okay maybe this whole living together happened kind of suddenly but it’s fine it’s great.
15782,Howard,You’re welcome ladies.
15783,Sheldon,Or a one. A one is possible.
15784,Sheldon,Oh and an exploratory laparoscopy. Last time I had hiccups it felt like my diaphragm was just going through the motions.
15785,Leonard,Thanks Stuart. Let me ask you something. Do you think it’s okay for Penny to have an ex-boyfriend sleep on her couch?
15786,Penny,Yeah that’s great. It’s a funny story. Moving on.
15787,Sheldon,Well said Boy Wonder.
15788,Leonard,By making constipated moose sounds?
15789,Sheldon,That’s nice.
15790,Howard,They exist in case we ever make contact with an alien civilization.
15791,Raj,Well they’re looking to include a message from Earth in case one of them is encountered by alien life.
15792,Howard,I didn’t get a lot of that because of your accent but the general tone was soothing and somehow I feel better.
15793,Penny,Okay.
15794,Leonard,Hey.
15795,Raj,I don’t want to go back to India. It’s hot and loud and there’s so many people. You have no idea they’re everywhere.
15796,Leonard,What is wrong with you?
15797,Raj,I say we begin with a classic Star Trek fight scene.
15798,Penny,What? What are you doing with what?
15799,Leonard,Doctor doctor. Surgical resident. Smart pretty. Let me ask you something. If your friend thinks he’s dating someone but he’s not because in fact you’re dating her does that make you a bad person?
15800,Leonard,I’m begging you stop talking.
15801,Penny,Oh oh that’s too bad. Well hey don’t worry I’m sure there is someone out there who is just right for you. .
15802,Raj,Oh pish on your issues. You guys are fine. Yes you hit some bumps along the way. I mean Penny you’ve always known how this man has felt about you but you made him grovel for affection.
15803,Sheldon,That’s very kind of you Stuart. Check back in with me in July.
15804,Raj,Our dreams are very small aren’t they?
15805,Howard,Downward-facing dog.
15806,Penny,Pull up your pants.
15807,Penny,Me either.
15808,Leonard,I made an eight o’clock reservation.
15809,Leonard,Uh I’m gonna go lie down.
15810,Sheldon,Who’s going to tell whom about what?
15811,Penny,I used Sheldon’s money to pay my rent then I had like fourteen dollars left over.
15812,Penny,Why would that make me feel better?
15813,Sheldon,Oh let’s take advantage of his absence and tell the kinds of jokes only physicists get. I’ll go first. Okay here. Uh Heisenberg is pulled over by a police officer. And the policeman says did you know you were going 85 miles per hour? And Heisenberg says darn it now I don’t know where I am.
15814,Penny,Flirting? You think I’m flirting with you? I am not flirting with you no woman is ever gonna flirt with you you’re just gonna grow old and die alone.
15815,Sheldon,Of course.
15816,Penny,Okay well goodnight. 
15817,Penny,See that wasn’t so bad. He even picked up the check.
15818,Raj,So should we go talk to him?
15819,Sheldon,Welcome back. Our guest today is a returning fan favourite. He puts the reading in your rainbow the Geordi in your La Forge and the Kunta in your Kinte Mr. LeVar Burton.
15820,Leonard,No no nothing like that. The deal was that if either of us ever got a girlfriend we’d have her fix the other one up with one of her friends.
15821,Howard,Also my cousin.
15822,Leonard,She’s gonna hate how often we say the word panels.
15823,Leonard,You’re leaving?
15824,Sheldon,Yes it is.
15825,Sheldon,And I suppose my boots and spurs are ridiculous too?
15826,Howard,Really? Ask her how many children she wants and whatever number she says say me too.
15827,Leonard,Sorry buddy.
15828,Leonard,But it’s an expression of our love.
15829,Sheldon,You know I haven’t seen Raj in several days. Is he no longer a part of our social group? And if so should we be interviewing for a replacement? Perhaps this time we go Latin.
15830,Sheldon,Are you upset about something?
15832,Sheldon,Then I won’t get to see his face light up as he reads it.
15833,Sheldon,I was asking for directions. Apparently there was a communication problem.
15834,Leonard,Come on guys push.
15835,Howard,Did you get in?
15836,Howard,How about soup?
15837,Leonard,That is a pencil sharpener.
15838,Penny,Uh which one the Classic Burger the Ranch House Burger the Barbecue Burger or the Kobe burger?
15839,Leonard,Yeah that scares me too.
15840,Leonard,Hey Lesley.
15841,Sheldon,Okay.
15842,Raj,They’re just having a little trouble communicating. My dad says it’s because the sound of my mom’s voice makes him want to tear his ears off and sew them over his eyes so he never has to look at her again.
15843,Howard,Hey guys guys President Siebert is headed this way.
15844,Howard,Don’t be ridiculous. Waiter?
15845,Howard,Not Brian Boitano that’s for sure. How’s your burrito?
15846,Leonard,There’s this guy Jimmy Speckerman who used to torment me in high school. He sent me a message through Facebook. He’s in town and wants to have drinks.
15847,Leonard,Like what?
15848,Leonard,What ails her?
15849,Sheldon,Yeah it’s journals and research papers I wrote as a child.
15850,Sheldon,Just wait.
15851,Penny,Can I sit wherever I want? No no never mind never mind that’s that’s not important. Sheldon this was big of you. Thank you. I really appreciate it.
15852,Sheldon,Amy may I please have a moment of privacy to speak with my roommate?
15853,Leonard,Come on I’ll help you pick something.
15854,Howard,We can still see something. Uh the new Sandra Bullock movie is playing two blocks away. You know Sandy B always brings it.
15855,Sheldon,You don’t tackle the big issues Ramona. You fence with them. En garde. Riposte.
15856,Sheldon,Oh yes you are. I track your cycle. For the next 36 hours you’re as fertile as a manure-covered wheat field.
15857,Sheldon, Amy?
15858,Raj,A successful quest. Now let’s go find a gas station with a clean bathroom.
15859,Leonard,Nice try. NSYNC forever.
15860,Howard,What is it about this holiday that makes people so unhappy?
15861,Sheldon,I think I’m hysterical.
15862,Sheldon,You’re right. You’re right. Got it. We order calzones cut them open eat them like pizza. All right all right I’ll shake the brain bush one more time see what falls out. Got it. There’s a live-action role-playing group that meets every Thursday night in Griffith Park and re-enacts battles from Lord of the Rings.
15863,Sheldon,I can’t answer that without collecting additional data.
15864,Howard,Born in New Delhi the third son of an itinerant gynecologist I showed early signs of genius. At the age of five I discovered a celestial object which later turned out to be the moon.
15865,Leonard,No thanks.
15866,Sheldon,Why?
15867,Leonard,I’m not a preschooler.
15868,Penny,Nicely done.
15869,Sheldon,Oh and forget what I said about the Myanmar catfish. My list of marine-themed pilgrim facts is pretty short.
15870,Sheldon,Yeah. My 1/18 scale Wil Wheaton action figure. I also have the other kind of will and in it I will my Wil back to Wil.
15871,Raj,That’s not him.
15872,Howard,Yeah maybe that is something. How did you find that?
15873,Leonard,Why?
15874,Sheldon,Holy smoke why didn’t I think of that? You’re a better man than I Howard Wolowitz. You put ‘er there you son of a gun!
15875,Howard,Really? It’s okay if I listen with you?
15877,Howard,Hell Hounds. Who let the Satanic dogs out? Who? Who-who?
15878,Raj,What? Another one. You know it it’s weird. When they’re reading your profile does it does it make you feel exposed? Like they see you naked?
15879,Penny,Oh. Um it was it was just going to be me and Bernadette. Besides I thought you were going to the movies with Sheldon and the guys.
15880,Leonard,2.5 seconds for the light to return. That’s the moon! We hit the moon!
15881,Penny,It’s obvious that they meant well but I’m just I’m having a really rough time like I said I broke up with my boyfriend and it’s just freaking me out.
15882,Penny,No. I just made out with him a little while his date was puking.
15883,Sheldon,You think you’ve got problems. The gibbon is the only member of the ape family not classified as a great ape.
15884,Penny,I don’t know.
15885,Sheldon,No. Did she seem upset to you?
15886,Leonard,This is actually gonna happen.
15889,Howard,But Bernadette makes more money than Howard. She basically supports him.
15890,Penny,Yeah. Oh can I drive the motorcycle?
15891,Sheldon,I hate this planet.
15892,Howard,Oh of course.
15893,Sheldon,I’m afraid it can’t. The trip is tomorrow. And I have more apologies to make.
15894,Leonard,Howard Howard look at this.
15895,Leonard,Look even your friend Wil Wheaton thinks this is a waste of time.
15896,Howard,Oh man the first monster I see I’m gonna sneak up behind him whip out my wand and shoot my magic all over his ass.
15897,Leonard,Nope. It’s pretty exciting.
15898,Sheldon,I’m not Sheldon. I’m the Flash. And now I’m going to the Grand Canyon to scream in frustration. I’m back.
15899,Howard,Oh my God she’s that Mona? Why can’t you and my sister spend your nights here?
15900,Leonard,Yes you do.
15901,Leonard,What the hell are you doing?
15902,Leonard,Our shower works.
15903,Howard,Really?
15904,Sheldon,It’s an observational rebuttal of the Lambda-CDM model of the universe.
15905,Penny,Yeah and I never wanted to kick Albert Einstein in the nuts. You know I gotta ask why didn’t you just get a license at 16 like everybody else?
15907,Penny,My God Leonard do you know what I could do with that kind of money?
15908,Penny,Well my go-to move is usually sleep with the person’s boyfriend but I kind of feel like I’m already doing that.
15909,Raj,Hi Amy. Can I talk to Penny?
15910,Sheldon,I don’t know. I was on the Pasadena freeway I missed my exit flew off the overpass and one thing led to another.
15911,Leonard,I can’t believe we’re going all the way to San Diego to confront this guy.
15912,Sheldon,Oh Duchess look at me. My quantum gravity’s positively loopy.
15913,Sheldon,Tom is a paramedic with the fire department but he’s going to med school at night uh he likes the outdoors and uh strong women who initiate sex.
15914,Leonard,Way to narrow it down to everything.
15915,Howard,Yeah.
15916,Leonard,Raj we’re not getting TV’s Blossom to join our physics bowl team.
15917,Penny,Ooh that looks like fun.
15918,Penny,Well we are known for our cheesecake. Hit us again.
15919,Howard,Welcome to the Raj Mahal.
15920,Penny,Uh you know it started a little rocky but I think we got to a good place.
15921,Leonard,Oh jeez. Is this suit really look that bad?
15922,Sheldon,At least take this with you. Look and have Stephanie initial here here here here and here. This states that she does not now nor does she intend to play a percussive or brass instrument. Sure it sounds like a tumor pressing on the auditory nerve.
15923,Sheldon,It’s a Frisbee-sized wormhole Leonard. You can block it with a Frisbee. Calm down. 
15924,Sheldon,Could you be more specific?
15925,Penny,Okay just you wait and see. I’m gonna romance your freakin’ ass off.
15926,Sheldon,You will?
15927,Penny,Oh my God. You weren’t supposed to be here till Sunday.
15928,Leonard,By the way my leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.
15929,Sheldon,Well then the solution is simple. I shall befriend him. Kripke!
15930,Leonard,What are you doing?
15931,Raj,Ooh ooh! Do our babies will be smart and beautiful. That one always makes me laugh.
15932,Sheldon,Well you’re my friends. You’ll be standing by my side supporting me feeding me legal precedents and if you had the upper body strength carrying me out on your shoulders when I’m victorious.
15933,Penny,Ah You guys are the best.
15934,Leonard,Okay that’s it you’re fired.
15935,Penny,By the end. Yeah.
15936,Leonard,But if I get a chance to be a tenured professor I might not have that much choice in where I end up.
15937,Sheldon,Do you think they’re going to put my outburst in the documentary?
15938,Leonard,Oh you’re his little girl he can’t stay mad at you.
15939,Leonard,Huh… Scrimmage…
15940,Howard,Holy crap.
15941,Howard,There’s nothing to tell.
15942,Penny,Don’t listen to her she’s had a lot of ice cream. Do you want to join us?
15943,Howard,I I hope we didn’t make the puzzles too hard.
15944,Penny,Are we terrible people?
15945,Sheldon,There we go compromising again. We really are the best.
15946,Penny,So what do you say Sheldon? Are we your X-Men?
15947,Leonard,But boy it is funny to think about.
15948,Leonard,Because I love Penny and want to give her the life she deserves.
15949,Raj,It’s fantastic. Unbelievable.
15950,Howard,Maybe Howard and Bernadette said I could be here.
15951,Leonard,That’s what you said five minutes ago. Amy and Penny are already in the car. Let’s move it.
15952,Penny,Alright fellas I gotta go. Good luck.
15953,Sheldon,Well you have to go. It’s Penny’s first time leading the Pledge of Allegiance.
15954,Leonard,There goes our big payday.
15955,Sheldon,I’m a theoretical physicist.
15956,Howard,No.
15957,Raj,He can’t figure out how to fix it.
15958,Sheldon,How about constantly talks with food in her mouth?
15959,Penny,Well so how much is that?
15960,Sheldon,Wrong sir. Wrong. Under section 37B of the roommate agreement miscellaneous duties you are obligated to take me to the dentist. See? It’s right here after providing a confirmation sniff on questionable dairy products.”
15961,Howard,That was a lousy suggestion.
15962,Raj,The doorman said this is the right building.
15963,Sheldon,You stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard?
15964,Penny,Why are you back from your date so early?
15965,Penny,Well guess I gotta drink.
15967,Leonard,What?
15968,Howard,Okay look I’m on the Air Force Web site and the department that e-mailed you is in charge of acquisitions. So maybe they just want to give you a lot of money for your invention.
15969,Leonard,It’s colour coded.
15970,Howard,Hey you know that beautiful actress who plays the Borg Queen in First Contact?
15971,Raj,Look at this. Do you think she’s really doing that or is it PhotoShop?
15972,Howard,No problem. Ooh you made little sandwiches.
15973,Sheldon,Oh there’s this company that’s attempting to establish a colony on Mars and I applied to be among the first to go. What should we name him? You know I came in thinking Seth but he kind of looks Italian.
15974,Sheldon,Mine was great. I’m going to be a mommy. 
15975,Leonard,Uh red means fix right away. Yellow is eh whenever you get a chance. And green is I could probably learn to live with it. There’s a key down here at the bottom. It’s neat huh?
15976,Sheldon,Xbox.
15977,Raj,Okay um how about Crash”? Howard “Crash” Wolowitz.
15978,Leonard,I’m sorry about the journal. I want to make it up to you. So I’m gonna let you post a shame photo of me on Facebook.
15979,Penny,Why do we have to tell him I did it?
15980,Penny,Oh it’s not a problem.
15982,Raj,Okay.
15983,Penny,It’s one onion ring.
15984,Penny,All right Sheldon just ask your question.
15985,Penny,Oh come on. Every time we’re about to hang out with my friends you don’t want to. It’s like It’s too loud or the bathroom’s too dirty or they put a chicken wing in my ear. I mean…
15986,Raj,Hey! That’s my sister and my country you’re talking about. Leonard may have defiled one but I won’t have you talking smack about the other.
15987,Sheldon,Boy I’m getting good at this.
15988,Leonard,Well we did it.
15989,Sheldon,Amy had a fight. I was being perfectly reasonable. I’m gonna have a whiskey. Do you want anything?
15990,Sheldon,Someone will show.
15991,Sheldon,All right.
15992,Howard,Good for Sheldon deciding to stay with Amy on her birthday.
15993,Penny,Yep. Shake that thing.
15994,Sheldon,In a minute.
15995,Sheldon,A tad asymmetrical but nothing to be concerned about.
15996,Raj,I do. And some of it’s wool so dry flat if possible.
15997,Sheldon,They’re both curry based cuisines.
15999,Raj,Can you even eat those things?
16000,Penny,Even though your dress is ugly.
16001,Sheldon,Yeah yeah. All right Poindexter sit down shut up and listen.
16002,Sheldon,Excuse me. We’re not taking comments or questions from the audience just yet.
16003,Leonard,I didn’t even know what it was. I saw it on your nightstand. I picked it up.
16004,Penny,Okay look just because we’re not seeing each other anymore doesn’t mean we can’t be friends. I mean Leonard’s a great guy.
16005,Sheldon,What do you suppose he’s doing here? Besides disrupting the local gravity field.
16006,Sheldon,Those women are prostitutes? You said they were raising money for stem cell research.
16007,Leonard,You know what? It’s fine. Keep the money. We just want to be done with this.
16008,Raj,Find new friends.
16009,Sheldon,Vocal test. Morning vocal test. Second vocal test. Second morning vocal test.
16010,Sheldon,Secret keeping is a complicated endeavour. One has to be concerned not only about what one says but about facial expression autonomic reflexes when I try to deceive I myself have more nervous tics than a lyme disease research facility.  It’s a joke. It relies on the hominymic relationship between tick the blood-sucking arachnid and tic the involuntary muscular contraction. I made it up myself.
16011,Raj,Okay if I upset you then why didn’t you just say something?
16012,Leonard,My bug report to you.
16013,Leonard,Okay um here’s the thing um sometimes people good people you know they start playing these games and they find themselves through no fault of their own you know kind of addicted.
16014,Leonard,Oh really? That’s too bad.
16015,Howard,Oh great now I can say things like I can’t believe you’re breaking up with me why are you breaking up with me? Yes I’ll still help you move.
16016,Sheldon,Interesting hypothesis. Let’s apply the scientific method perform an experiment.
16017,Leonard,Penny’s really looking forward to seeing you.
16018,Sheldon,You did.
16019,Raj,Hey.
16020,Penny,Yeah. So you have a song stuck in your head. It happens to everybody.
16021,Penny,If I’d thought of that in the first place I could’ve saved myself this whole night.
16022,Howard,He’s always been very cagey about what he puts in his egg salad to make it so tasty.
16023,Howard,That’s very good. Jolly amusing but if you don’t mind I’ll hold off until sunset on titan.
16024,Penny,Well I’m a people person. People like me. Some of my favourite people are people. I feel like I’m saying people a lot. People people people. Okay I’m done.
16025,Sheldon,There’s someone at my door.
16026,Sheldon,The National Science Foundation wants to give me a substantial grant.
16027,Leonard,Gentlemen.
16028,Leonard,Actually it kind of… let’s keep looking. Whoa what’s eighteen hundred dollars to the Los Angeles County Superior Court?
16029,Penny,So you want me to stop calling your little tushy cute?
16030,Leonard,Hey we’re home. Any progress?
16031,Leonard,Hey. Can we talk?
16032,Howard,Hey guys.
16033,Leonard,Ready.
16034,Raj,And then they held hands and did a sexy demonic hokey-pokey for us.
16035,Leonard,Yeah. It just makes it a lot harder to pretend it never happened.
16036,Leonard,Oh wait you lent her money?
16037,Sheldon,Actually that’s my work.
16038,Howard,Yes in the telescope room.
16039,Penny,Oh don’t get all huffy. You’re the one who decided to move in without even asking me if I was ready.
16040,Raj,While I’m gone you can think about how mean you were to me.
16041,Leonard,Guys everyone is involved in thios okay? Howard’s invention Sheldon’s math my original theory that space-time was like a supercooled liquid. Which I’m sure Penny would’ve mentioned if she wasn’t working on that hangnail right now.
16042,Raj,So I found this Web site where you send them pictures they sculpt your head and make an action figure out of you. How awesome is that?
16043,Raj,Stir the gravy.
16044,Leonard,I don’t think so. Why?
16045,Leonard,That is Sheldon’s “I’m unhappy and about to destroy the planet” music. Come on let’s just go to your place.
16046,Penny,Hey.
16047,Leonard,Really?
16048,Howard,Yeah you’re right that’s too personal. We hardly know each other. How about a cup of coffee?
16049,Leonard,When did you pick up on that?
16050,Howard,It was an accident. The doctor left the folder out on her desk. It’s not my fault I opened it and looked.
16051,Howard,Is it me or was that Sheldon’s way of saying Vegas baby!
16052,Leonard,What?
16053,Leonard,I thought it’d be a little more just more.
16054,Leonard,Hey watch your speed. I hear the Mexican police target tourists.
16055,Leonard,Sure or you can.
16056,Howard,But I can use the downstairs bathroom right?
16057,Sheldon,No no. We’re here let’s settle this. Professor can you identify our cricket?
16058,Penny,Oh God. Amy!
16059,Penny,Anyway I got a little residual cheque from my commercial and I thought hey how about I get the guys a little thankyou to pay them back. So Sheldon ta-da!
16060,Penny,Hey would you take a look at my brother’s résumé? I’m trying to help him clean it up a little.
16061,Leonard,How so?
16062,Penny,Well you’re pretty delicate. Maybe you shouldn’t be pushing yourself so hard.
16063,Sheldon,I’m sorry I got bored and drifted off. Where exactly in the interaction did the sucking lie?
16065,Leonard,Yeah it’s just one sneeze.  You’re on your own.
16066,Raj,I know I am resplendent like the noonday sun am I not?
16067,Howard,Oh. Thank you for taking such good care of my little girl.
16068,Leonard,I almost died!
16069,Sheldon,Am I in trouble? Did my mother call you?
16070,Raj,Bye.
16071,Raj,Hello. Oh it’s so good to see you.
16072,Howard,What are you waiting for? Kill Wil Wheaton! From hell’s heart stab at him!
16073,Sheldon,I know it’s baffling.  Nobody knows the trouble I’ve seen.
16074,Sheldon,You want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?
16075,Raj,What are you doing?
16076,Sheldon,Why would you do that?
16077,Howard,Our dreams are very small aren’t they?
16078,Sheldon,I rest my case. Amy don’t you agree we should leave now and get in line?
16079,Sheldon,It is if you like bridge. Do you like bridge Leonard?
16080,Leonard,Should we give them their privacy?
16081,Raj,Hello Emily.
16082,Leonard,Hey Penny. Leonard again.
16083,Howard,You’re right. This is beneath me. Lie your mother was last night.
16084,Penny,Damn it!
16085,Leonard,Sure sure. Uh when will Stuart be back?
16086,Sheldon,Dobby the elf dies in book seven.
16087,Sheldon,It is isn’t it? Is it okay if I hide them in your room? The smell makes me nauseated.
16088,Raj,Oh if it’s even the U.S. Military. It could be foreign military pretending to be American.
16089,Sheldon,And I just hope that this scholarship can rescue your child from the subpar education and menial life of an engineer.
16090,Raj,Uh my plans with Priya.
16091,Leonard,Want to come to dinner with us?
16092,Leonard,An old boyfriend who’s definitely not gay. That’s what a guy likes to hear definitely.
16093,Penny,Well I also said I was getting you water but look at me still standing here. You know I may be a bad waitress but you are a bad person. Now you want to hear the specials?
16094,Penny,Sheldon what do you want?
16095,Sheldon,It’s okay. It wasn’t my first pantsing and it won’t be my last.
16096,Raj,You guys ever notice that Emily has a bit of a twisted side?
16097,Leonard,Uh I know! It’s been a while!
16098,Leonard,Well uh the important thing is he’s married and that’s terrible!
16099,Sheldon,Beverly would you like to see the math I worked out to support our hypothesis?
16100,Howard,I thought she was the whore of Omaha?
16101,Leonard,Hey I always did sound effects. A-A swarm of bloodthirsty bats fly through the dungeon. 
16102,Raj,My friends told me it was okay to see more than one person at a time but it it feels like I’m being deceitful.
16103,Sheldon,Look at him just standing in line like he wasn’t moderately famous 30 years ago. Let’s go say hello.
16104,Leonard,Penny.
16105,Leonard,Oh mummies and zombies again.
16106,Leonard,Fine. Assuming that everything you say is true how does the biologically superior Homo Novus get to work tomorrow morning?
16107,Leonard,Don’t come in here don’t come in here don’t come in here don’t  Aw! What’s going on?
16108,Leonard,What?
16110,Sheldon,Or you could pitch in grab a nostril and help me get this face off.
16111,Leonard,I don’t know. He uses that traffic app. Maybe there’s an accident.
16112,Penny,I don’t have any experience in sales. Unless you count the bikini car wash I did in high school. But you already made me take that off my résumé.
16113,Penny,I’m sorry to hear about your troubles.
16114,Sheldon,Oh I hardly think so. The real caped crusader calls his crime-fighting cohorts when he’s running late.
16115,Leonard,Howard where you going?
16116,Penny,Hey. Seriously? Didn’t you get enough of this cliquey crap in high school?
16117,Penny,Damn it. Should have liberated the iffy chicken. What are you and Professor Fussyface up to tonight?
16118,Leonard,No I heard that.
16119,Howard,I know you could ask Bernadette for a raise in your allowance.
16121,Sheldon,It depends on what Bus you have.
16122,Sheldon,Hello Penny.
16123,Leonard,Little bit yeah.
16124,Sheldon,Oh clever! Playing on the use of cardinal numbers as euphemisms for bodily functions.
16125,Sheldon,It’s not Elvish. It’s the language of Mordor written in Elvish script. One Ring to
16127,Sheldon,See this is why I wanted to have a costume meeting.
16128,Sheldon,No. We’re going with middle child and a generic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production.
16129,Raj,Good?
16130,Penny,You know what the worst part is? You’re sitting here perfectly happy and he’s at home a blubbering mess.
16131,Sheldon,No.
16132,Penny,Am I a matchmaker or what?
16133,Raj,Penis first?
16134,Leonard,It was at least five Mississippis. A standard hug is two Mississippis tops.
16135,Leonard,They are not.
16136,Raj,Okay.
16137,Penny,Yeah. You know I want to be upset but we did kind of have fun working on the prototype.
16138,Penny,Yes.
16139,Leonard,Yeah there kind of does.
16140,Penny,What’s up?
16141,Penny,I don’t think I asked you.
16142,Sheldon,Hello home wrecker.
16143,Sheldon,It was pretty easy. And I think my background in mathletics helped. Barry Kripke was there. I should let you know that he expressed interest in asking you out.
16144,Howard,Oooh.
16145,Raj,I get it. What do you want to do?
16146,Sheldon,An interesting question. Well good night.
16147,Penny,Who’s my favorite Backstreet Boy?
16148,Howard,All right.
16149,Leonard,You know if you’re trying to make space on the DVR why don’t you just get rid of some of the stuff you’ve already watched? Like um Alphas.
16151,Raj,Then the robot uprising has begun.
16152,Sheldon,I tried to scare an Indian with a snake. Come on Cooper. You’re better than this.
16153,Raj,You have to admit it’s a pretty smooth ride.
16154,Penny,Is that Raj and Howard?
16155,Sheldon,Why?
16156,Raj,We can drive there.
16157,Leonard,Um it did end happy for you. You’re here with me.
16158,Penny,Of course I won’t. No I won’t.
16159,Penny,It’s okay I do look Leonard is helping Sheldon through a family crisis he made up the whole story about the symposium with Dr Farmin..farm…ian
16160,Sheldon,Oh oh. And guess where we get to sleep? Our choice of a turn-of-the-century railway bunkhouse or a working caboose. Now the problem with a caboose is there’s no bathroom but the problem with the bunkhouse is it’s not a caboose. On the first day I get to drive a steam engine. Oh and the second day a diesel engine. Oh and if I volunteer to do track maintenance and paperwork they’ll let me stay as long as I want. So you might want to pack enough clothes for the rest of our lives.
16161,Penny,No it’s the movie your wife doesn’t want you to see.
16162,Penny,Hey good for you Raj.
16163,Penny,We’re so sorry if we made you feel uncomfortable. We really weren’t fighting about you.
16164,Leonard,We’re watching Goonies Gremlins and Young Sherlock Holmes. They were all written by Chris Columbus.
16165,Sheldon,Goodbye Penny.  Oooh one of these days Pkshhhh!
16166,Sheldon,That’s why the call it cloaking dead man.
16167,Sheldon,If outside is so good why has mankind spent thousands of years trying to perfect inside?
16168,Penny,Yeah well I don’t think it’s very funny.
16169,Howard,Please take me back. Our love was meant to be.
16170,Leonard,Honestly? It’s a little strange having dinner with your ex-boyfriend and it’s not like we have a lot to talk about.
16171,Leonard,Hi uh um I’m Leonard?
16172,Leonard,Great timing food just got here.
16173,Penny,Well you could shove them somewhere.
16174,Penny,What did I do?
16175,Raj,I have to talk to her about this.
16176,Leonard,No the problem isn’t solved. He just blew us off.
16177,Sheldon,Hmm perhaps. But I’m not taking the cap off.
16178,Sheldon,I’m sorry are you unaware of the upcoming Southern California Robot Fighting League Round Robin Invitational?
16179,Sheldon,Bored.
16180,Penny,Mm-hmm.
16181,Leonard,I don’t care what you guys think Stephanie and I are very happy living together. I will give either of you 20 dollars right now to trade pants with me.
16182,Sheldon,Well our earthquake supplies we have a two day two man kit.
16183,Leonard,You betrayed us for money who are you?
16184,Sheldon,You just lied to Penny.
16185,Sheldon,My spot on the couch has a great view of a window. Sometimes I can see space battles through it. It’s called a TV.
16186,Howard,No uh-uh you’re going down!
16187,Leonard,No she wouldn’t.
16189,Leonard,Then he got more angry and kicked the rock with his other foot.
16190,Leonard,Oh.
16191,Sheldon,Oh I never joke when it comes to vertigo.
16192,Leonard,Well to be fair he is also a rather unpleasant winner.
16193,Sheldon,It doesn’t matter right now you’re looking for treasure.
16194,Penny,Oh I’m so sorry. I wish I could make you feel better.
16195,Penny,Hey I hope you don’t mind I used a little of your eye cream last night.
16196,Penny,Really? I feel like I’m selling candy so our team can get new uniforms.
16197,Leonard,That doesn’t sound too bad.
16198,Raj,Hey did I say something to upset you?
16199,Raj,No because she wants to have sex with me in a graveyard.
16200,Penny,All right then we agree. He’s not making any moves it’s this Dr. Ramona chick.
16201,Raj,From there it was easy to find him on Instagram Snapchat and pretty much track his every movement.
16202,Sheldon,Yeah additionally you should know that the university has mandated that I take an online sexual harassment seminar so this sort of thing doesn’t happen in the future.
16203,Sheldon,Two grown men with a hobbit’s dagger; wouldn’t we look silly? Okay let’s go for it.
16204,Penny,No. No no. It’s just it’s a little big.
16205,Raj,How’d you do that?
16206,Raj,May I join you?
16207,Sheldon,Okay. Quick question. Am I allowed to exchange pleasantries upon meeting this colonel?
16208,Sheldon,You know what? This isn’t gonna work.
16209,Leonard,A thousand dollars on action figures? How can you afford that?
16210,Howard,Sheldon we’re really sorry.
16211,Howard,Well we’ve all seen your mom. That Butterball turkey was bound to come home to roost.
16212,Raj,Dude what is she saying?
16213,Sheldon,The objective of the competition is to give correct answers if I know them why shouldn’t I give them?
16214,Sheldon,I don’t need you to guess I need you to know now when did the symptoms first appear?
16215,Penny,If Harry Potter’s wand can make decisions why can’t Thor’s hammer?
16216,Sheldon,Wait so you’re just going to take all the work we’ve done for the last year and toss us aside?
16217,Penny,Sure you have.
16218,Leonard,You’ve had an acting job where you got paid?
16220,Sheldon,Come on come on we’re late.
16221,Howard,That’s what you’re wearing.
16222,Leonard,Just keep thinking. I got it.
16223,Sheldon,Wait a minute! You’re not going to do anything?
16224,Leonard,The hope has been that you’d eventually bend to public opinion. So Priya what brings you back to LA?
16225,Penny,Okay. Thank you you’re the best. Mm.
16227,Leonard,Hold on did you talk about us when we were dating?
16229,Penny,It was eight courses of lamb and they tried to fix me up with their son.
16230,Sheldon,Well I’m e-mailing him right now.
16231,Leonard,Well it’s tricky working with superfluids. Whatever container you put them in they kind of creep up the sides and crawl out all on their own.
16232,Sheldon,All right why don’t we see if we can bring this back to topic.
16234,Sheldon,I know how to behave.
16235,Sheldon,Oh I don’t want to know that! How can I possibly discuss with Stan Lee the scientific foundations for interstellar flight on a silver surfboard when part of my brain will be scanning his face for signs of contagious skin disease?
16236,Leonard,Okay here’s my question why did you sit down?
16237,Sheldon,What a nice girl.
16238,Sheldon,You heard her. How can I argue with me?
16240,Sheldon,Well sir my trousers will not be igniting today.
16241,Leonard,Sheldon why are you doing this?
16242,Sheldon,Very well. And good luck I’m a pretty laid-back guy.
16243,Leonard,That part was pretty good.
16244,Leonard,Sheldon let it go.
16245,Leonard,Hey. Hi.
16246,Sheldon,One for good luck. Must be the kind of math they do at Princeton.
16247,Howard,By moving on do you mean she’s going out with other men and you spent the afternoon making fifteenth century soap with Wolowitz?
16248,Raj,I’d love that but she’s not really comfortable around people.
16249,Penny,Anybody home?
16250,Leonard,Yes no and no.
16251,Penny,Your shoes.
16253,Raj,What are you working on?
16254,Sheldon,No it’s not.
16255,Raj,Now who’s dying of jealousy? Oh it’s you.
16256,Leonard,Are you kidding? I couldn’t even talk him into giving me one of his freakin’ napkins.
16257,Raj,Oh man when I come out of the closet I’m gonna nail those guys. Yeah I heard it. Shut up.
16258,Howard,So if the fact that your husband left you makes you feel unattractive just remember penguins get cheated on and they’re adorable.
16259,Sheldon,They’re not supposed to but they should.
16260,Penny,What did you do?
16261,Sheldon,That’s what my sister used to say.
16262,Leonard,I actually have used those exact words before. In that order.
16263,Sheldon,Excellent choice.
16264,Leonard,But thanks thanks for thinking of us.
16265,Leonard,I thought we had something special.
16266,Sheldon,I was kind of hoping I could continue vacationing in your laboratory. After all I did book the whole week.
16268,Sheldon,Mmm. You know I’ve been told that a bald refusal of an invitation is rude and one must instead offer up a polite excuse so I’d love to go but unfortunately that sounds awful.
16269,Howard,See what?
16270,Sheldon,I submitted you a notarised list.
16271,Sheldon, Bernadette.
16272,Leonard,Greetings distinguished cheerleaders.
16273,Penny,All right round one. Here.
16274,Howard,Oh no don’t put me in the middle of this. I’m not going to be your go-between.
16275,Leonard,Well one of them is.
16276,Sheldon,You said be nice to Penny. I believe offering chocolate to someone falls within the definition of nice.
16277,Sheldon,Yeah me too. Triple digits I’m not gonna lie feels pretty good.
16278,Raj,Don’t worry I’m a grown man. I have a thick skin.
16279,Leonard,Two ten and you throw in the Iron Man helmet.
16280,Leonard,Hello.
16281,Raj,We can’t send him back to North Korea. He knows how to get out.
16282,Penny,Mwah!
16283,Sheldon,Oh it is. Although.
16284,Leonard,No the overreaction was the plan to tie your limbs to four different sled dog teams and yell mush. Look we kept the original data. You can still publish the actual results.
16285,Howard,Okay let’s check out the females.
16286,Penny,Penny. I work at the Cheesecake Factory.
16287,Sheldon,See I I had tickets to the Star Wars premiere that night but Professor Proton came to me in a dream dressed as Obi-Wan Kenobi and convinced me I should be with you.
16288,Penny,Yeah you’re a scientist where is the curiosity?
16289,Sheldon,All this could be avoided if you’d just come to the meeting.
16290,Penny,But we can’t.
16291,Penny,I did. I called them. The part’s gone. They gave it to someone else. Now that girl’s gonna get discovered and become famous and go on Letterman and talk about how she got her big break on a cheap monkey movie all because some dumb girl thought it was beneath her.
16293,Leonard,Amy what are you doing here?
16294,Leonard,Knowing Sheldon nothing.
16295,Sheldon,When Albert Einstein came up with special relativity he was working at the patent office.
16296,Penny,Leonard look if you want to meet my friends that would be great. I just you know I didn’t want you to be bored.
16297,Raj,Yeah okay so zombies.
16298,Sheldon,Where are you going?
16299,Raj,Looks like someone else is going to have to be Wonder Woman.
16300,Leonard,Right. Ah! Where’s the lime?  Oh okay we’re sharing.
16301,Leonard,No no I messed up a little. You messed up a lot.
16302,Howard,All right.
16303,Penny,All right I’m sorry you’re famous.
16304,Sheldon,I miss the old days when I couldn’t tell.
16305,Sheldon,Yes amusing. Extraordinary intelligence might well appear extraterrestrial to you but let me be more specific. I believe you know why I’m here in the laundry room.
16306,Sheldon,Yes.
16307,Sheldon,She tried to rope us into going to her acting class to see a play. Don’t worry. Luckily I had the good sense to drown that kitten in the river.
16308,Raj,You will?
16309,Sheldon,So how’s Koothrappali d…. oh my Lord.
16310,Howard,So have you figured out what you’re going to say to him?
16311,Penny,Really your potty training journal?
16312,Raj,Yeah. Like his haircut material.
16313,Penny,No thanks. Leonard and I are just going to the funeral.
16314,Leonard,Okay since we agree on the delivery system for the message maybe we should talk about what the message could be.
16315,Howard,That’s what I said when we moved it.
16316,Leonard,Oh geez I don’t know if I can ditch Priya two nights in a row.
16317,Raj,I’m sorry I seem to be taking an annoying amount of time deciding how I feel about this.
16318,Penny,What are you working on?
16319,Howard,You know guys when facing disappointment Eat Pray Love teaches us–
16320,Penny,Which was?
16321,Leonard,Mm you know that I didn’t travel more take more risks learn another language.
16322,Raj,Well I know how to make it special.
16323,Howard,With sex.
16324,Sheldon,You pick that up right now.
16325,Sheldon,Then why did you say it.
16326,Raj,Okay guys go ahead and divide yourselves into teams of two.
16327,Raj,Hmm. Wonder what she sees in Leonard.
16328,Sheldon,Yes I’m close to a breakthrough. Ooh it tickles
16329,Leonard,Uh the kitchen’s fine.  Hey what are you doing?
16330,Sheldon,Is it a high-frequency whistle?
16331,Raj,Yes I do come on. See you later Leonard. 
16332,Howard,Hey Claire. Good you’re here. Guys this is my friend Claire. We’re casually dating and there’s no need for any further questions about it.
16333,Raj,Or we could talk to this guy he used to share an office with.
16334,Sheldon,If it’s like your 3-D chess game then you’re out of your length width and depth. Amy get the Neosporin somebody just got burned.
16335,Leonard,Oh hang on. Check your in-box.
16336,Leonard,I know. I’m lowering the bar so slowly. This time next year she’ll have a coin collection.
16337,Howard,Actually I have to tell you something. These kind of movies really aren’t my thing so last night I watched it just to see what I was getting myself into.
16338,Penny,No. What I’m saying is Leonard might be different in a good way. Obviously my usual choices have not worked out so well.
16340,Leonard,And don’t let him go on Space Mountain after he eats. He’ll say he can handle it but I promise you’ll end up with churro puke on your shoes.
16341,Penny,I bet Jennifer gets a promotion out of this which is so unfair because I work twice as hard as she does.
16342,Leonard,Never gets old. No no to a girl. Anyway I told her what happened between you and me and she’s concerned about us seeing each other at work.
16343,Sheldon,I’m just wondering if you really gave it the old college try? Or in your case the old community college try?
16344,Sheldon,Hey good news I just got off the phone with my mother. She is coming to the wedding.
16345,Leonard,I’m gonna miss you.
16346,Leonard,I had to she called me cutie.
16347,Leonard,See?
16348,Leonard,Yeah if you like that type.
16349,Leonard,What?
16350,Penny,Oh why didn’t you wear it at Halloween?
16351,Penny,Well how did you guys become friends?
16352,Leonard,Of course who am I to argue with a check-plus student? Just warning you I’m gonna go right. Don’t make a big deal out of it.
16353,Penny,You see me all the time. You sure you just don’t miss the sex?
16354,Howard,World’s Greatest Astrophysicist?
16355,Leonard,It’s just a bunch of pants.
16356,Raj,Ooh limited edition. Nice.
16357,Raj,She knows you. She’s tense. We all are. Buy a basket!
16358,Howard,Perhaps this will help. Here are some facts about yourselves in the future that might contain a clue.
16359,Raj,Totally. What’s wrong with cap sleeves? If you have the right figure for it they’re adorable.
16360,Sheldon,That’s a good idea. Penny did you and Leonard ever discuss funeral arrangements?
16361,Sheldon,Look at me. I can get as close to you as I want without my mom saying it’s going to ruin my eyes.
16362,Penny,Yes.
16363,Howard,A little bird told us. Apparently you are a magnificent beast.
16364,Howard,You know if I wanted to spend my Saturday nights doing this I could have stayed in India.
16365,Penny,Oh that sounds like a good thing.
16366,Penny,We?
16367,Penny,Come on honey not in front of my dad.
16368,Leonard,Every scenario I play out for you and me ends badly.
16369,Leonard,Why would you just say something like that?
16370,Raj,Me too.
16371,Penny,Yes.
16372,Sheldon,You know the nice thing about Shel-Mart is I own it so I get a 15% discount.
16373,Howard,You guys ever notice that Emily has a bit of a twisted side?
16374,Leonard,A surprised you know that. B I wanted to look like a sexy graduate for you.
16375,Leonard,I love you.
16376,Sheldon,You know I’m right.
16377,Sheldon,Roommate agreement? Are you kidding? We are living in a world of chaos. Roommate agreement.
16378,Leonard,There’s a security camera?
16379,Howard,Yeah sleeping under the stars with other fans who love the show as much as we do.
16380,Sheldon,Uh-oh. What if it’s Jennifer Lawrence?
16381,Leonard,You told her my experiment was stupid?
16382,Howard,Hold on. We do that all the time. You and I work together and play together.
16383,Sheldon,Hmm. Do you know how to integrate X squared times E to the minus X without looking it up?
16384,Howard,Yeah. This military guy showed up at Howard’s door. He was terrifying.
16385,Leonard,They’re in a group. I’m scared.
16386,Leonard,Okay why would I go to a drug intervention for your cousing.
16387,Sheldon,It’s hard to say no to yoo-hoo. The name literally beckons.
16388,Raj,Oh derived from the word angel. Appropriate.
16389,Sheldon,You used to make those jokes about me. Now everything is Bert Bert Bert.
16390,Raj,Funny how that worked out.
16391,Sheldon,You didn’t break up she dumped you.
16392,Leonard,You want to breed a new friend?
16393,Leonard,It’s from the Institute for Experimental Physics. They want us to present our paper on the properties of super solids at the topical conference on Bowes-Einstein condensates.
16394,Leonard,Good.
16395,Sheldon,I’m sorry. Although based on your story you absolutely were the reason why.
16396,Leonard,Come on we have a combined IQ of 360 we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building.
16397,Leonard,I’ve had enough of your condescension. Maybe I didn’t go to college when I was eleven like you maybe I got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16 but you are not the only person who is smarter than everyone else in this room. No offense. And I am clearly not the only person who is tormented by insecurity and has an ego in need of constant validation.
16398,Sheldon,I’m fine.
16399,Raj,I can’t wait to ask Stan Lee why he insists on giving all his characters first and last names that start with the same letter.
16401,Penny,Oh that’s so sweet. But I’m going out dancing with a girlfriend.
16402,Sheldon,I’ll get Leonard.
16403,Sheldon,Oh. I’ll just take one last sip. Ah.
16404,Leonard,So Mrs. Cooper what did you think of the sushi?
16405,Sheldon,AFK. Away from keyboard.
16406,Howard,He’s using psychological warfare. We must reply in kind. I say we wait until he looks at us then laugh like yes you are a smart and strong competitor but we are also smart and strong and we have a reasonable chance of defeating you.
16407,Leonard,I was going to characterise it as the modification of our colleague/friendship paradigm with the addition of a date-like component. But we don’t need to quibble over terminology.
16408,Raj,I would love to. I do enjoy the complexity of an aged Pinot noir.
16409,Howard,Hey we agreed when it was Eureka time we were all gonna say it together.
16410,Penny,Oh here’s your coat honey. That’s such a cute jacket. Oh God I feel so bad I just lied to her.
16411,Sheldon,Aren’t you slicing that man’s brain a little too thin?
16412,Leonard,No you don’t. He doesn’t.
16413,Leonard,What’s this?
16414,Sheldon,Oh. I should call her and apologize. Oh no.
16415,Penny,I’m not even sure why we were out of breath. Uh I mean did we move at all?
16416,Penny,I’m not talking to you.
16417,Sheldon,Oh dear. Now I’m not even smarter than you.
16418,Sheldon,Three-headed lion.
16419,Sheldon,On a scale of one to ten where one is a pebble in your shoe and ten is the monkey you thought was your pet biting your face off.
16420,Sheldon,Which side of the bed would you prefer?
16421,Penny,Oh.
16422,Sheldon,How many trains have you been on?
16423,Sheldon,All right what we need now is a tactical retreat. Did you see the episode of Stargate where they found themselves on a planet with a culture based loosely on Earth’s Athens and Sparta? Not important. Leonard Raj and I are going to burst out the door and run away Howard will cover us.
16424,Howard,Okay. If I make this shot in the trash can the probe will have arrived in perfect working order.
16425,Howard,Maybe you’re right. Wow I am easy to manipulate.  Oh guys it’s Emily. What should I do?
16426,Howard,Thirty seconds.
16427,Leonard,What?
16428,Leonard,Oh no. I wish you’d told me that sooner.
16429,Leonard,Well if he doesn’t want to live with her then he should tell her how he feels.
16430,Leonard,Stop asking me all these questions I need to take another shower.
16431,Sheldon,I know they’re making a rhetorical point I just don’t know what it is.
16432,Leonard,Yeah it was.
16433,Sheldon,You’re sitting in my spot.
16434,Sheldon,Are you going to the office?
16435,Leonard,Look I mean I’m not proud of it but it does work. I got her to watch a six-part documentary on Monty Python. Even I was bored I just wanted to see if she’d make it to the end.
16436,Penny,Yeah it’s fine.
16437,Raj,It’s like the best one they make I just can’t get it to work.
16438,Sheldon,I guess. Don’t worry I was going to order you cheeseless.
16439,Sheldon,Choosing a new laptop Is an incredibly personal ritual. You have taken away weeks of agonizing thought tedious research sleepless nights filled with indecision. I haven’t I lost enough today?
16440,Penny,We need to talk.
16441,Raj,Sheldon did we all not just watch the same video? Kripke’s robot just had angry sex with a mid-sized automobile.
16442,Raj,What’s that?
16443,Raj,Oh my God Kenny G? This woman can read me like a book. I can’t believe I bought my soul mate at Glendale Galleria.
16444,Penny,Wow that is better.
16445,Sheldon,I’m okay. I’m okay. I’m not okay.
16446,Leonard,Well it is. Just you know I’d be gone for a while.
16447,Leonard,Why? What are they doing?
16448,Sheldon,Our entire order is predicated on four dumplings and four entrees divided among four people.
16449,Sheldon,Buona sera Luigi’s Pizza. Buona sera. It means good evening in Italian. May I say having to explain that to you calls into question the authenticity of your ristorante?
16450,Raj,What are you talking about? They’ve always known where you live.
16451,Sheldon,Drat.
16452,Penny,Oh. Well would you consider mounds of credit card debt kind of a big deal financially?
16453,Penny,Sorry. Spoiler alert. My point is as much as I want to live with you I can’t do it knowing how much Sheldon needs you.
16454,Sheldon,Alright let’s say I go to dinner alone. And during the meal I have to use the rest room. How do I know someone’s not touching my food?
16456,Sheldon,Good morning and welcome to Science and Society. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper BS MS MA PhD and ScD. OMG right? Perhaps that joke was a little too hippie-dippy for this crowd. All right then we’ll begin with opening remarks. Miss Rostenkowski would you like to start us off by discussing your assessment of science’s responsibility to society?
16457,Leonard,I guess we let them wait until they’re old enough and let them choose their own theory.
16458,Raj,No! Not enchanted bunny!
16459,Leonard,That’s pretty cool.
16460,Sheldon,Got it.
16461,Sheldon,Something remarkable. Since my prospects for the Nobel Prize in physics have disappeared thank you very much I’ve decided to refocus my efforts and use my people skills to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Look I’m going to solve the Middle-East Crisis by building an exact replica of Jerusalem in the middle of the Mexican desert.
16462,Leonard,You know we haven’t spent time alone together since we broke up.
16463,Sheldon,Thank you.
16464,Leonard,No I meant…. never mind. Hey check it out. I got you a Batman cookie jar!
16465,Sheldon,It doesn’t say. It must be an emergency. Everyone at the university knows I eat breakfast at eight and move my bowels at 820.
16466,Leonard,Terrible. I worked really hard on that project. I stayed up all night singing the clown’s aria from Pagliacci to a lima bean sprout.
16467,Leonard,Yeah um of all the things about this that are sad that might not be number one. You okay? I know he meant a lot to you.
16468,Penny,How is it okay?
16469,Sheldon,Well mind you now that offer’s only good until the third trimester. I can’t risk getting amniotic fluid on my spot.
16470,Leonard,Oh sure. Huh maybe I am her gay friend.
16471,Sheldon,Excuse me. Leonard they have a sculpture gallery.
16472,Sheldon,Okay. Enough chitchat. Okay step one locate your emergency key to our apartment. Step two enter our apartment. Step three enter my bedroom.
16473,Raj,Can I ask you guys a question? So I’m seeing Lucy tomorrow night and I’ve never hung out with someone who broke up with me. How do you do it?
16474,Raj,Hi. Oh let me bring a chair for you.
16475,Sheldon,So Wil what do you have for us first?
16476,Leonard,Huh? If you think that’s cheesy buckle up. Penny Hofstadter will you please stay married to me?
16477,Raj,There’s been a problem with an experiment. A bird got into the clean room.
16478,Howard,Yeah we totally did.
16479,Raj,He took the day off.
16482,Sheldon,Of course you didn’t he said little idea?
16483,Sheldon,I realise that Dr Gablehauser but it is your job as head of the department to mediate all inter-departmental disputes. University policy manual chapter four subsection two mediation of inter-departmental disputes.
16484,Sheldon,I wish you hadn’t done that. That’s going to make me a chick magnet and I’m so busy as it is.
16485,Sheldon,I was otherwise engaged.
16487,Sheldon,Leonard all our lives we have dreamed of finding ourselves inside one of the fantasy worlds we love. And look at us. At this moment we are in fact a Star Trek landing party stranded in an alien and unforgiving environment relying only on our wits our fortitude and our moxie. As long as we have those things nothing can stop…
16488,Howard,Hello Father. We need to talk.
16489,Penny,Wait. Cybernetics is robot stuff right?
16490,Leonard,It’s two o’clock in the morning
16491,Sheldon,Of course you get a card. It’s Leonard’s Day.
16492,Sheldon,A little physics? There’s no such thing. Physics encompasses the entire universe from quantum particles to supernovas from spinning electrons to spinning galaxies.
16493,Leonard,But it could be part of your problem. Let me give you an example. When I was eight I won a ribbon at the science fair for my project “Do Lima Beans Grow Better to Classical Music.” But my mother pointed out that it was just a rehash of my brother’s earlier “Do Lima Beans Grow Worse to Rock ‘n’ Roll.” I felt so guilty I gave the ribbon back.
16494,Sheldon,Really? Huh! Okay. In that case I will have a s’more by myself. And then I’m gonna have s’more. By myself.
16495,Leonard,She’s lying because she doesn’t want you to know we’re dating.
16496,Leonard,Holy crap are you connected to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory?
16497,Sheldon,The trouble isn’t with me Penny it’s with your gender. Someday scientists will discover that second X chromosome contains nothing but nonsense and twaddle.
16499,Leonard,Yeah. Maybe Wesley Snipes and Toucan Sam just got action figures that look like you guys.
16500,Leonard,Sorry but we can’t sign this.
16501,Leonard,I’d suggest a lubricant but I have a feeling you fell on some of that as well.
16502,Sheldon,You the president of the university his wife their sullen teenage daughter. That entire family is fascinated by what time it is and whether people know it.
16503,Leonard,Well how about we stop being so scared of losing each other and just be together?
16504,Raj,I’d be more interested in a scene depicting Spock’s conception.
16505,Raj,Answer the question what are you doing here?
16506,Sheldon,Do you need to borrow a toothbrush or pajamas?
16507,Leonard,Hello.
16508,Sheldon,Sure why not? And after the sun’s down we can all pile in my pick-up and go skinny-dipping down at the creek. ‘Cause today’s the day to stop making sense.
16509,Leonard,Okay here it is. Penny’s in kind of a financial jam and the money that you owe her would go a long way to solving her problems.
16510,Penny,Okay whatever it sounds like fun.
16511,Howard,Hang on I’m not saying that his feelings aren’t crazy. I just don’t want him to think that this isn’t a safe place.
16512,Howard,Oh I know why don’t we get started on clearing out the baby’s room?
16513,Raj,Just until he gets back on his feet which are looking pretty good in the boots I bought him for his birthday.
16514,Leonard,No it should be why are you?
16515,Sheldon,Oh my. Well then my apologies for bringing up this sore spot.
16516,Penny,Yeah actually it was pretty cool. A lot of the girls threw up but I gutted that thing like a deer.
16517,Sheldon,Why does Leonard get to go?
16518,Leonard,Thank you.
16519,Leonard,Uh…
16520,Penny,Thank you.
16521,Leonard,I’m just saying if we fake got back together that’s totally not how it fake happened.
16522,Leonard,Yes.
16523,Penny,Yep.
16524,Penny,Okay that’s fine but let’s try and get you out of your comfort zone.
16525,Howard,Oh please sit. I tried to cook you a meal from your homeland.
16526,Leonard,Yes. I thought we were in the kind of relationship where we make decisions together. If I’m wrong then maybe we need to talk about the kind of relationship we’re actually in.
16527,Leonard,Why the hell not?
16528,Sheldon,Highly. Oh dear. 
16529,Penny,No problem. So Leonard I think it’s interesting you didn’t call your girlfriend to come get you.
16530,Leonard,Do you really care about that last one?
16531,Penny,Present! Yeah!
16532,Sheldon,Oh. Well I suppose I do think of you as a sister. And sometimes a mother.
16533,Sheldon,Oh please I’m your boyfriend. You call me Sheldon. That’s right I am in a boy-girl relationship with this cute little lump of wool.
16534,Howard,He takes the kitty to the potty?
16535,Sheldon,Oh good. You’re back.
16536,Howard,There’s no reason to worry.
16537,Raj,Well okay you’re a you’re a talented artist you own your own business.
16538,Leonard,She makes more money than I do.
16539,Penny,Sheldon are you okay?
16540,Penny,So if it breaks there’d be none of it?
16541,Sheldon,Walking away.
16542,Howard,The mysterious subcontinent of India.
16543,Sheldon,Nothing.
16544,Raj,I didn’t come to help I came to mock.
16545,Raj,Good to see you.
16546,Raj,Do you see the way she’s looking at him?
16547,Leonard,You did seem a little loopy when you showed up at the lab.
16548,Raj,Hello.
16549,Leonard,Hey here’s a thought. Why don’t we put up the rest of the money that Stuart needs?
16550,Leonard,That was two hours ago.
16551,Raj,I like green lantern I’m just saying it’s pretty lame that He can be defeated by the colour yellow.
16552,Raj,You look you look really pretty tonight.
16553,Sheldon,Well no it’s just I’m just warning you you know if you find yourself 3000 miles away and craving a hit of this you know I can’t Skype it to you.
16554,Leonard,I’ve seen old pictures of you. You were never a fat kid.
16555,Leonard,Here we are.
16556,Raj,Upsilon?
16557,Raj,Well I I really couldn’t. But uh I’ve had a lovely time eating your brisket and hearing about the things you’ve had removed from your body over the years. Didn’t know you could have a cyst inside another cyst.
16558,Sheldon,Well it certainly would be easier. You have no idea what it’s like to struggle with recognizing emotional cues.
16559,Raj,A kidney cornea piece of his liver?
16560,Sheldon,Well gentlemen have you reached a decision?
16561,Leonard,Pass the soy sauce.
16562,Sheldon,I think that’s a week from Tuesday at six.
16563,Leonard,I honestly don’t.
16564,Sheldon,Excuse me I need to pay Bert a proper congratulations.
16565,Sheldon,I don’t understand the question.
16566,Sheldon,Yeah well I am angry. And you telling me not to be angry makes me angry. And do you know how hearing myself say the word angry over and over makes me feel?
16568,Sheldon,That depends.
16569,Sheldon,Can we talk about something else? Do you know that I yodel?
16570,Howard,Are you sure? They turn off the lights and it’s like a cute little laser show that poops all over the place.
16571,Howard,I’ll make the popcorn.
16572,Penny,I probably should have spit out my gum first.
16573,Leonard,What are you doing here?
16574,Leonard,So when you say you’re not going to freak out about the DVD here’s what that means. Don’t fixate on it. Don’t wake me up in the middle of the night. Or nag me through the door while I’m on the toilet.
16575,Raj,Why?
16576,Penny,Okay. We are reading that right now.
16577,Sheldon,Drat. Now I’m 8 for 27.
16578,Howard,Wow so you’re not curious at all?
16579,Penny,I love you too.
16580,Leonard,I know. I just thought as an outsider you might be able to provide a fresh perspective.
16581,Leonard,Merry Newton-mas everyone.
16582,Penny,Doing what?
16583,Penny,Aw.
16584,Leonard,Oh hi.
16585,Raj,Hey I won a Newcomb medal too.
16586,Penny,Oh okay then this one.
16587,Raj,Because this one wants to marry me. I might never find another one who does.
16588,Raj,Philadelphia. Okay now I get it.
16589,Penny,Wait hang on. Doubles. Roll again.
16590,Penny,Really? ‘Cause I love it.
16591,Sheldon,What do you want?
16592,Penny,Well I sell pharmaceuticals. That’s just a really hard to spell word for drugs.
16593,Sheldon,I’m sorry you were embarrassed. And now I understand that some things are just between you and me and in the event of redness and swelling Dr. Fink.
16594,Leonard,Did you hear about this study that found people that were cool and popular at 13 have problems succeeding later in life?
16595,Leonard,Uh-huh. Well the holographic principle suggests that what we all experience every day in three dimensions may really  So it’s possible that our lives are really just acting out a painting on the largest canvas in the universe.
16596,Penny,Yeah I didn’t have any quarters so I’ve been sneaking stuff into other people’s loads all day. Hey if I tell you something will you promise not to tell anybody?
16597,Sheldon,Where are you going?
16598,Sheldon,Anything you’d like to pet? Not my hair. There’s a lot of goop in it.
16599,Howard,You might want to slow down a bit buddy.
16600,Penny,Thank you. So if we would have asked you to come to Vegas to see us get married you would’ve come?
16601,Raj,That was all a lie? This year’s gifts are already wrapped!
16602,Sheldon,Yes.
16603,Sheldon,Perhaps this was a waste of time.
16604,Sheldon,Disagree.
16605,Sheldon,Guten Tag das YouTube. Ich bin ein Bavarian.
16606,Leonard,Oh good. Context.
16607,Penny,Screw that. 
16608,Raj,Excuse me can I say something? I just love both you guys and I want you to get along. And when I say love I meant as a friend. And uh way too soon right?
16609,Raj,No you didn’t. Okay? Look Bert when I had money I dated lots of girls who weren’t right for me. And then I gave up my money and now I’m alone and living with my friends and somebody else should probably talk now.
16610,Sheldon,Too late. No backsies.
16611,Leonard,You cannot blow up my head with your mind.
16612,Sheldon,No!
16613,Sheldon,They don’t wear bicycle helmets in Game of Thrones. You’re thematically inaccurate but I applaud your commitment to safety.
16614,Penny,And now we go to Reverse Warrior.
16615,Penny,Oh my God. It’s your birthday. Let’s do something fun.
16616,Howard,Howard Wolowitz?
16617,Leonard,Oh I’m not. It’s about you.
16618,Penny,What? He loves you okay? And he’s interested in your work. You could talk about the infinite perspective… I swear I know it.
16619,Sheldon,A bully chased me through the school library and hit me over the head with the biggest book he could find.
16620,Sheldon,Stop talking like that. You’ve been rendered speechless by fear.
16622,Raj,Hey Leonard will you please tell Howard my sister’s never been attracted to him.
16623,Sheldon,It’s not enough that she mocks me but that isn’t even the correct procedure for a cootie shot.
16624,Raj,Adjust the thermostat cook with cilantro pronounce the T in often?
16625,Raj,Prepare your uterus for his gigantic offspring?
16626,Howard,My point is if I were a horse or a bird I’d be very nervous around James Cameron.
16627,Raj,Really? I’ll do anything.
16628,Sheldon,Hi.
16629,Sheldon,No wait. I need you to call Stan Lee Leonard Nimoy and Bill Nye the Science Guy ’cause legally I’m not allowed to. Oh and also Carrie Fisher you know ’cause I hear he can be pretty nuts.
16630,Sheldon,With what?
16631,Howard,I have three brothers and two sisters Sheldon I can do this all day.
16632,Leonard,We do have Sheldon’s old room. If he really needs a place to stay I guess we should offer it to him.
16633,Sheldon,Penny I have an IQ of 187 don’t you imagine that if there were a way for me to have had soup at home I would have thought of it?
16634,Howard,This was nice.
16635,Penny,I’m sorry?
16636,Howard,If my fingers ever work again I’ve got a job for the middle one.
16637,Sheldon,However on an unrelated topic I am never getting out of this bed again.
16638,Raj,What if it’s booby-trapped?
16639,Sheldon,Leonard lots of people could’ve had that idea but very few people could’ve worked out the math the way I did.
16640,Sheldon,I saved a nun’s life. Why am I being punished?
16641,Sheldon,With the little stars?
16642,Leonard,Boy a restraining order from Stephen Hawking. It’ll look so nice next to the ones he’s already got from Leonard Nimoy Carl Sagan and Stan Lee.
16643,Sheldon,You didn’t really type.
16644,Penny,Oh I guess that’s where Raj gets it from.
16645,Sheldon,Yes. I’m sorry I tried to blow up your head. It was uncalled for.
16646,Howard,I’m a little jealous of the people who get to do it.
16647,Penny,Here. Thank you for having us.
16648,Sheldon,Is that what that was? I just assumed that the second grade curriculum had rendered you quizzical.
16649,Leonard,That’s so nice.
16650,Howard,And over here is Sheldon.
16651,Raj,Hey got a minute?
16652,Penny,Um I don’t have one.
16653,Sheldon,Come.
16655,Leonard,I think so.
16657,Sheldon,So who’s watching her now?
16658,Sheldon,I don’t have a sad song. I’m not a child.
16659,Howard,No. I took her for coffee and she snuck out the bathroom window to get away from me.
16660,Raj,Thank you.
16661,Sheldon,Well a short bespectacled colleague of mine who lives in the shadow of his brilliant roommate. Let’s call this colleague Ricardo Shilly-Shally.
16662,Howard,We we can totally do that.
16663,Penny,That’s too many S’s for kissing.
16664,Penny,Do boys have flowers?
16665,Leonard,This is silly. I have nothing to worry about.
16666,Howard,I feel bad for Bert.
16667,Raj,Well put your mind at ease. I’m here to make sure your dinner party kicks Howard’s dinner party’s ass. Now the first thing we need is a theme. I’m thinking ah turn-of-the-century Moulin Rouge.
16668,Penny,Well Sheldon you’re his friend. Friends give each other presents.
16669,Howard,I uh I’m sorry to put you through that.
16670,Sheldon,What are you doing here Kripke?
16671,Penny,Oh nice to meet you.
16672,Penny,Hi. So um Priya you’re a lawyer right?
16673,Penny,Guys this is actually really simple.
16674,Howard,Tonight’s the night.
16675,Raj,Hey since Sheldon’s not going to Comic-Con maybe we could find a cool trio to dress up as.
16676,Leonard,I don’t think you need to worry about death by badgers being hereditary.
16677,Howard,Ooh Sock Mouth’s got him on the ropes.
16678,Raj,Well this is all your fault.
16679,Sheldon,Are you sure? I’ve heard that on those sites often when you think you’re corresponding with someone it’s actually a computer program pretending to be a real person.
16680,Penny,Whatever. Put us on the Internet. I’ve always wanted a wedding with a comment section.
16681,Sheldon,Open the mail!
16682,Sheldon,Leonard be serious. We’re playing a game here.
16683,Penny,I don’t know. Up until the last part I was kind of enjoying take-charge Leonard with a little backbone. Picking the movie knowing what he wants a little cocky.
16684,Penny,Sorry.
16685,Penny,Well where is he?
16686,Sheldon,You did this?
16687,Sheldon,Yeah it really takes the pressure off.
16688,Leonard,That doesn’t make it true.
16689,Leonard,Well congratulations. Who would’ve thought you two would be the first in our group to start a family?
16690,Penny,You’re the one who seems upset.
16691,Howard,I think it’s lovely you call your mommy and let her know you’re going to be late for dinner. From what I know about these things if a woman doesn’t breast-feed on time it’s very uncomfortable for her boobies.
16692,Sheldon,All right. Leonard fairly calls the question who is in favour of abandoning our game and confronting Penny’s steroid-infused ex-boyfriend in a suicidal mission to extract money from him? Say hi to Kurt for us.
16693,Sheldon,You want me to look at him and listen to him?
16694,Sheldon,Focus Leonard focus! The heat of battle is upon us the dogs of war are unleashed.
16695,Howard,Missy do you enjoy pajamas?
16696,Sheldon,We’ll never know.
16697,Sheldon,In a venn diagram that would be an individual located within the intersection of the sets “no longer want my time machine” and “need $800”.
16698,Sheldon,Thank you.
16699,Leonard,No I haven’t.
16700,Leonard,Again no offence but so have I.
16701,Howard,You sure?
16702,Howard,I can’t watch anymore.
16703,Penny,If you guys would shut up I could tell you. Oh. Be cool be cool be cool.
16704,Sheldon,Not really. I feel somewhat like an inverse tangent function that’s approaching an asymptote.
16705,Sheldon,You’re welcome. One more thing.
16706,Leonard,Yes and I think we should go anyway.
16708,Penny,That’s what I’m afraid of.
16709,Leonard,You know what guys I’m not in the mood for paintball. What do you say we just bag it?
16710,Penny,Right? I can’t believe Amy actually went through with it.
16711,Leonard,You’re kidding well then that’s something we have in common.
16712,Sheldon,I don’t know. I could do anything. All bets are off. The world is my oyster. I got it. I’m going to put on my Tuesday pyjamas tonight.
16713,Leonard,A lot of people are working on that research. So what is all this?
16714,Sheldon,There have been studies.
16715,Sheldon,Of course she does. Making me food is her way of saying I love you. Making me food when she’s too tired to cook is her way of saying I really love you.
16716,Sheldon,What’s that animal doing in our apartment?
16717,Howard,You know if you knocked out this wall it would give you an open floor plan and then it’s a little scary but could be fun indoor fire pit.
16718,Sheldon,Well then it looks like we have a winner. Congratulations.
16719,Sheldon,Are you trying to suggest that my emotional problems are no different than those of a stupid person?
16720,Sheldon,Where’s the mouthwash?
16721,Sheldon,Yes ma’am.
16722,Sheldon,One question.
16723,Raj,No. I haven’t played the race card yet.
16724,Penny,Hey. What’s up?
16725,Raj,It’s my fault. I asked Penny to do yoga with me.
16726,Leonard,Oh hi Penny.
16727,Sheldon,Penny rub Vicks on my chest.
16728,Howard,How do you do? Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali. Call me Raj.
16729,Howard,Oh dude. The minute you opened that e-mail they knew you got it. I mean they’re probably looking at you through the camera right now. I love America.
16731,Sheldon,What are they doing here?
16732,Sheldon,Sure if you consider being fragged by your own troops fun.  You clear space on your calendar there will be an enquiry.
16733,Sheldon,Yeah try me.
16734,Leonard,Come on you pain in the ass.
16735,Leonard,It’s anonymous and user name General Relativity.
16736,Raj,Wow that’s harsh.
16737,Howard,Oh Howard it’s still our thing. Come with us we’ll we’ll get you a scalped ticket.
16738,Raj,What’s wrong with me Penny?
16739,Howard,Do you want to hang out tomorrow night maybe grab a bite to eat or catch a late movie?
16740,Sheldon,I hate your apartment.
16741,Penny,Oh my. It’s not a contest.
16742,Howard,Come on Sheldon Star Wars.
16743,Sheldon,It’s not that simple Leonard.
16744,Sheldon,I don’t know what you mean by quirks but um I do want to express my gratitude.
16745,Raj,I don’t. I have a hole in my belly button that may or may not have been a piercing.
16746,Penny,Did you take dance lessons?
16747,Leonard,What’s up?
16748,Leonard,You’ve really got to get out more.
16749,Raj,No I’m actually dating two women. Later.
16750,Leonard,To wine and bubble wrap. And to not having to watch Sheldon demonstrate his reverse osmosis machine that converts urine into drinking water.
16751,Howard,Who are you bringing?
16752,Penny,No no we’re not playing some dumb made-up game.
16753,Sheldon,I’m sorry. It takes me a while to get things going on an unfamiliar toilet.
16754,Leonard,Hi!
16755,Sheldon,In what space sir in what space? She’s two feet above the ground. Frankly if he really loved her he’d let her hit the pavement. It would be a more merciful death.
16756,Sheldon,Maybe I’d be better off with Nancy.
16757,Penny,You know you look thirsty. I brought you some iced tea.
16758,Sheldon,And no more singing.
16759,Raj,So?
16760,Raj,It’s all of ours. 
16761,Leonard,No.
16762,Howard,Amy good luck getting these guys excited about a dinner with a theme. I gave up when no one cared about my Tom Hanks-giving.
16763,Sheldon,Barely knew him.
16765,Sheldon,Okay where were we?
16766,Howard,Yes. Whenever things are going well I always find a way to ruin it. You two look happy how do you do it?
16767,Penny,Aw.
16768,Raj,What… what kind of a kiss?
16769,Penny,Wow I get it because Dr Leonard Hofstadter can’t date a girl without a fancy college degree.
16770,Penny,Okay who wants a drink?
16771,Sheldon,Da-da-da-da da-da-da!
16772,Raj,It’s the least I can do for helping me carry my stuff up.
16773,Sheldon,Hey there he is there’s my old buddy-bud-bud.
16775,Leonard,No it’s this Friday at eight.
16776,Leonard,Because it’s not a costume it’s a flight suit.
16777,Raj,You called me feminine. And I I wanted you to think I was more manly.
16778,Leonard,Thank you. What did he say?
16779,Leonard,No.
16780,Penny,Oh God. I think I see where this is going.
16781,Sheldon,Fine. In the interest of preserving our friendship…
16783,Leonard,I’d say damn it in Klingon but that wasn’t until next month.
16784,Howard,Oh me too. You’re so caring. I’ve often pictured you guiding a young boy into manhood.
16785,Penny,Oh what’s that ring box?
16786,Howard,Later losers!
16787,Penny,Aw.
16788,Penny,All right it’s got to go.
16789,Sheldon,I have one question. Is this a prank where we land in Houston and you’ve made up wanted posters that have my face with a moustache and a Spanish name and then I get arrested and deported to South America?
16790,Penny,Sheldon you are a grown man haven’t you ever been sick before?
16791,Sheldon,Wow. Your life’s amazing.
16792,Raj,Try to keep up Howard I’m killing it.
16793,Raj,Yeah he’s over it that’s why he’s been whining all day about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from Men in Black.
16794,Leonard,I know. You want to get a picture?
16795,Sheldon,I don’t follow.
16796,Sheldon,I’ve been seeing Penny behind your back.
16797,Sheldon,Read another one.
16798,Sheldon,Rut? I think you mean consistency. And if we’re going to abandon that then why even call it Thursday? Let’s call it Quonko Day and divide it into 29 hours of 17 minutes apiece and celebrate it by sacrificing a goat to the mighty god Ra.
16799,Sheldon,Anyway should you have any interaction with her it would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival.
16800,Howard,He never went back to the university?
16801,Howard,Perhaps some of his mojo will rub off on us. Maybe between this and his beach house we will be inspired to greatness.
16802,Sheldon,Because Leo is a middle child.
16803,Howard,And I’m just hearing about this now?
16804,Penny,No Mr. smarty-pants. I ignored the fill gas tank light.
16805,Penny,Oh thanks Raj it’s vanilla oil.
16806,Leonard,Thanks yeah.
16807,Leonard,Come on. Sorry to bother you.
16808,Raj,How can you be embarrassed around me? I’m gonna be in the room with you when you give birth.
16809,Sheldon,I’m starting to think we’re never going to see that pizza.
16810,Howard,Come on dude I’m exhausted and Tyra Banks says the most important item in your makeup bag is a good night’s sleep.
16811,Sheldon,Well just this once you can count me as people too.
16812,Raj,Okay Leonard put down the box let’s talk.
16813,Leonard,Yes but I think this is all a big misunderstanding.
16814,Sheldon,So have you and I returned to a social equilibrium?
16815,Penny,Yeah and I’ve seen those legs. You might want to get some Drano.
16816,Penny,Yeah Leonard told me.
16817,Leonard,Terrific but that kind of raises more questions than it answers.
16818,Leonard,There’s no reason you can’t.
16819,Penny,Yeah but you wouldn’t be able to talk to yourself. I’m a little low on cash.
16820,Leonard,It’s an annual science conference. We’ve all been invited to speak.
16821,Leonard,Hey. You ready to go?
16822,Penny,Yeah well maybe she has interest in you.
16823,Leonard,Wuh Penny.
16824,Sheldon,Not at all. In fact I have got something for just such an occasion. I was starting to think I might never get a chance to give it to you. Good job.
16825,Sheldon,Yes. From Szechuan Palace.
16826,Penny,Anyway he had a bunch of outstanding tickets and a bench warrant so I you know I paid his fines.
16827,Howard,Interesting. I mean it’s not testicles on a cryostat but I like it.
16828,Sheldon,Well I’d hardly call this kidnapping. Where’s the blindfold? Where’s the duct tape? Where’s the part where you call me and demand ransom and I try to keep you on the phone but you hang up seconds before I can trace it and then I say I’m getting too old for this crud?
16829,Sheldon,I’ve read that there are great yogis who have such mastery over their bodies they can draw water in through their genitals.
16830,Sheldon,I can’t tell you that. I’m bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.
16831,Leonard,So are our laptops.
16832,Penny,Maybe it’s a good thing we came here. It’s like a lesson in what not to do.
16833,Sheldon,Speaking of ending relationships when British Honduras became Belize they designed a new flag with a tree on it and I would like to hang myself from that tree.
16834,Sheldon,Professor Proton is dead?
16835,Raj,Spoiler alert! Spoiler alert.
16836,Leonard,Look I understand that breaking up with someone can be very painful….
16837,Sheldon,Excuse me? Excuse me jailor?
16838,Leonard,I can’t because if I don’t show up she’ll still be expecting you.
16839,Howard,Just until he gets back on his feet which are looking pretty good in the boots I bought him for his birthday.
16840,Sheldon,All I’m looking for is an educated intelligent woman who shares my interests while retaining her own unique point of view. She should be kind patient and most important unable to imagine life without me by ten o’clock tonight.
16841,Penny,Um the online game? Sure.
16842,Sheldon,Penny.
16843,Sheldon,Then there’s no excuse for this chicken. You know this situation with Koothrapali brings to mind a story from my childhood.
16844,Leonard,That’s not what she’s doing Leslie she’s just trying to shore up her self esteem it has nothing to do with sex.
16845,Penny,I am not putting that on the Internet. I don’t want people to see this. I don’t want to see it.
16846,Penny,What happened?
16847,Sheldon,Intimacy in any form has been challenging for me but I’d like to show her how important she is and it feels like now might be the right time.
16848,Leonard,So this is nice. First time we’ve all gotten together to eat.
16849,Leonard,Okay some of my Facebook friends aren’t geniuses. My point is if we’re going to be a couple I should be friends with your friends.
16850,Howard,I’m just being a good house guest.
16851,Leonard,It’s already loaded. Just hit play.
16852,Penny,Are you gonna make us pretend to be a bunch of lame characters with silly accents?
16853,Sheldon,This says Beyonce Bootylicious Dance Mix.
16854,Raj,My father’s a gynaecologist I think I can handle it. And now I’m gay.
16855,Raj,Then you leave me no choice. I accept the job.
16856,Sheldon,Boo wine! But yay trains. I’m in.
16857,Leonard,Uh cream.
16858,Leonard,She let me.
16859,Leonard,No it’s Leslie Winkle. It’s a long story.
16860,Sheldon,Yes Glenn! The only bird I ever loved.
16861,Howard,It’s a good thing.
16862,Sheldon,I suppose you’re here because I’ve decided to be physical with my girlfriend and I’ve never done that before.
16863,Penny,What do you think? For doing the same crap he always does except to a judge. He has to stay in there until he apologizes.
16864,Raj,You have to get to it eventually.
16865,Raj,Genius. I was gonna say why does anyone think Sheldon’s a genius? But I didn’t.
16866,Penny,Well I didn’t until I heard that.
16867,Sheldon,I see. Now are we talking date the social interaction or date the dried fruit?
16868,Leonard,So that sounds more like something you’d say if you didn’t want a relationship with someone. This isn’t working out but I’ll always have feelings for you. I’m sorry I slept with your best friend but I’ll always have feelings for you. Here’s the thing Lisa I’m into dudes now but I’ll always have feelings for you.
16869,Leonard,You hacked my facebook account?
16870,Leonard,Well whenever I talk about how awful my mom was Penny will do anything to make me feel better.
16871,Raj,Okay then.
16872,Howard,Knight to queen’s bishop-five.
16873,Leonard,Look I know shopping cheers you up but it’s just not really my thing.
16874,Penny,Wow so that means you’re a doctor you’re a doctor you’re a doctor you’re a doctor and Howard you know a lot of doctors.
16875,Howard,What do you mean?
16876,Penny,I’m proud of you. You’re taking this really well.
16877,Howard,Well that was a waste of time. I’m such an idiot.
16878,Sheldon,Another quest by Wolowitz? Count me in.
16879,Raj,Look I’m sorry you’re upset with me but I just have to say it’s nice to see the two of you on the same page.
16880,Sheldon,I would not say that. No-one would say that a light year is a unit of distance not time.
16881,Penny,Mm.
16882,Howard,Okay.
16883,Penny,What he arrested you for that?
16884,Raj,Maybe this time he’s going to do it.
16885,Howard,Yes you made that brutally clear to me. What I was going to suggest is if that you’re willing to wait until Sunday morning the Google satellite will be over Pasadena. You can have a wedding photograph from space.
16886,Sheldon,Yeah why would you?
16887,Penny,That’s not what the forest smells like.
16888,Howard,So you’re wandering all around by yourself? That’s not the kind of hero’s welcome an astronaut should come home to.
16889,Penny,You’re kidding.
16890,Leonard,Brrrr. Why are you smashing a flash frozen banana.
16891,Sheldon,With real puffing smoke?
16892,Leonard,Me-wow.
16893,Sheldon,Leonard Leonard. What is that? What is that?
16894,Leonard,Oh these are a little different. There’s a tradition at elite universities…
16895,Howard,How can I call her you know I can’t talk to women.
16896,Penny,Okay I get it I get it. You are an emotionless robot.
16897,Raj,Anyone in?
16898,Leonard,Hey guys what are you oh that’s here cool.
16899,Sheldon,Maybe maybe not. Maybe tomorrow I start a bongo band and tour the world.
16900,Sheldon,No.
16901,Sheldon,I always thought I was more like a cuckoo bird. You know a superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds. Of course the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death. Luckily for you that’s where the metaphor ended.
16902,Howard,Really! Did you miss all the subtle indicators like me saying Howard I am upset.
16903,Sheldon,Well once again it’s what I do.
16904,Penny,Okay. Well then there’s a couple of things you should probably know.
16905,Raj,What does it say?
16906,Penny,Hey! You don’t have to be so mean!
16907,Howard,What did I do?
16908,Penny,Okay well I’m gonna have to call them and cancel the order.
16910,Penny,Oh what a gentleman. Hey Sheldon. 
16911,Sheldon,Now if you’ll excuse me the father of the atomic bomb wants a saucer of milk.
16912,Sheldon,Now you’re being a responsible patient. Now you may notice some tingling.
16913,Howard,Is it too late for him to cancel?
16914,Leonard,I mean they didn’t say anything but I just kind of felt like I was being a weird third wheel.
16915,Sheldon,That’s over the wheelbase. Are you completely unfamiliar with the suspension characteristics of a pre-1980 Pullman-built Superliner Deluxe passenger coach?
16916,Raj,Emily these are my good friends Howard and Bernadette. Guys this is Emily.
16917,Raj,I’m sorry?
16918,Penny,Do little things like bring her a cup of coffee in bed.
16919,Penny,There’s no shame in asking for a break.
16920,Sheldon,Sheldor back online.
16921,Sheldon,Oh I know but just Leonard and Penny think we’re doing it and I don’t want to disappoint them.
16922,Sheldon,Okay I don’t know where you just came from but it couldn’t have been a team meeting because I’m on the team and I wasn’t there ergo the team did not meet.
16923,Sheldon,Well then you don’t understand what’s happening. See Leonard refused to participate in a mandatory quarterly roommate agreement meeting. This is what a generation raised on Bart Simpson looks like.
16924,Sheldon,For science maybe you should.
16925,Sheldon,Guess.
16926,Raj,So it spells Sheldon?
16927,Raj,You’re only making it seem more real for me.
16928,Leonard,Guys our topic is encouraging women in science can you at least play a less sexist game
16929,Penny,Yes Sheldon we are friends.
16930,Penny,Yeah I said I’m fine. Stop talking to me.
16931,Raj,I can’t believe what I’m hearing. This is deeply hurtful.
16932,Howard,I think we both know if I come over we’re gonna get back together and…
16933,Sheldon,So what are you in for?
16934,Sheldon,I want soup.
16935,Penny,Oh.
16936,Sheldon,And you’re certainly not going to win a Nobel Prize.
16937,Penny,Kind of. When was the first time someone called you sir?
16938,Sheldon,Okay but this is the last time. Nice try blockheads.
16939,Sheldon,Not surprising. Penny’s emotional responses originate from the primitive portion of the brain known as the Amygdala while speech is centred in the much more recently developed Neocortex. The former can easily overpower the latter giving scientific credence to the notion of being rendered speechless.  Or maybe she just doesn’t want to talk.
16940,Penny,Oh my God you guys look adorable.
16941,Penny,You should.
16942,Sheldon,I thought we were the Lightning Sharks.
16943,Penny, Sheldon.
16944,Leonard,Well I’m just saying I don’t have any real ties here so if I were to move to New Delhi we could you know go out.
16945,Howard,Where did he pop the question? What did you say?
16946,Leonard,I thought that might take his mind off the cushion.
16947,Sheldon,I don’t see why not.
16949,Leonard,What about when you flipped the Mars Rover or lost Koothrappali’s dog or almost drove off with that baby?
16950,Raj,Yeah I was. I was 200 pounds by the time I was in middle school. Kids were mean. Cows may be sacred there but it doesn’t help if you look like one. Anyway I was pretty lonely so I had to make up my own stories and games and I promised myself if I ever made any friends that that I would play those games with them.
16951,Leonard,No.
16952,Raj,Wild Bill Witchcock.
16953,Penny,I need to see this.
16954,Sheldon,That was my first thought but all my cool stuff is here.
16955,Sheldon,Very good. Chocolate?
16956,Leonard,You don’t know my birthday do you?
16957,Sheldon,Oh. Well I thought we were going in order.
16958,Sheldon,Question how am I going to get Leonard a present before the party? I don’t drive and the only things available within walking distance are a Thai restaurant and a gas station. I suppose I could wrap up an order of mee krob and a couple of lottery scratchers.
16959,Penny,Oh. Hi Amy. How you been?
16960,Howard,You just say uh Hey Siri what time is it?
16961,Howard,Will you come visit me in India?
16962,Leonard,Oh yes.
16963,Leonard,I was. Now I’m having a nightmare. What do you want?
16964,Raj,Grab a corner. Whoa what’s your hurry cowboy? Savour the moment.
16965,Sheldon,I never bluff. Ten.
16966,Howard,Fine you drink it.
16967,Leonard,I just said couples sound great.
16968,Sheldon,They were clever Leonard. They exploited my complete lack of interest in what you were doing.
16970,Leonard,So you really think they liked it?
16971,Penny,Uh 12 to 18 months from now depending on good behaviour.
16972,Sheldon,Who cares as long as you pick me.
16973,Sheldon,You hypocrite!
16974,Sheldon,Greetings.
16975,Sheldon,Yes and when Franconi’s went out of business we switched to Graziano’s.
16976,Sheldon,Why?
16977,Sheldon,Look at these men. They’ve managed to win the top science prize in the world with no more understanding of the quantum underpinnings of the expansion of the early universe than God gave a goose. You should pay attention Leonard. Someday this could be you up there.
16979,Penny,You know we could’ve come to you guys. You didn’t have to bring the baby here.
16980,Howard,Thank you for coming with me Sheldon. You’re a good friend.
16981,Penny,This place is great.
16982,Penny,Pardon. I just need to. yeah.
16983,Howard,Oh my God Cinnamon are you okay? I can’t believe you two. You do whatever it takes to save her life. If she needs new organs I’ll buy any dog necessary and scrap them for parts.
16984,Penny,Leonard’s being a jerk so we’re gonna watch over here.
16985,Sheldon,Did you bring the dehydrated low-sodium soy sauce?
16986,Leonard,The place really looks great.
16987,Raj,Oh oh uh you could uh stand outside his window with a boom box in the air.
16988,Leonard,There was a draft.
16989,Sheldon,Do you mind? We’re having a moment here.
16990,Penny,Hey this is my natural hair colour. Now. So does Sheldon have anything special planned for you tomorrow night?
16991,Penny,Hey. Ready to go to lunch?
16992,Sheldon,People compete for jobs and trophies why not me?
16993,Sheldon,I never eat in strange restaurants. One runs the risk of non-standard cutlery.
16994,Howard,How about that guy? He looks like he’d hate you.
16995,Raj,What’s with the gloves?
16996,Raj,I like it.
16997,Leonard,What’s that?
16998,Leonard,You’ve heard of him?
16999,Leonard,If I knew you were waiting I would’ve swallowed that lasagna whole.
17000,Sheldon,No. No this isn’t right. Our food always comes in Szechuan Palace containers.
17001,Leonard,What are you gonna do?
17002,Sheldon,But you’ve been engaged for over a year now and you don’t even have a wedding date.
17004,Sheldon,Emily as I’m sure you know I’m considered an odd fellow. But what you don’t know is that while I often say the wrong thing in my heart I mean well. I think that you are a smart and wonderful woman you know? And we all think that you can do better than Koothrappali.
17005,Howard,Is something going on with him and Bernadette?
17006,Howard,Well that was rather unpleasant.
17007,Howard,What?
17008,Sheldon,Leonard is going to  the office.
17009,Penny,Okay so here’s the thing. I guess you’re aware that Leonard asked me out.
17010,Penny,Leonard?
17011,Sheldon,Do I have to pull out the paperwork again?
17012,Raj,Yeah but if he’s a sore loser maybe you’re better off without him.
17014,Raj,Well Howard eating that pistachio was like when King Joffrey got poisoned.
17015,Sheldon,All this years I’ve been so wrong. The tinier the train the more concentrated the fun.
17016,Sheldon,Well if he does don’t believe it. He’s not above playing the dead meemaw card.
17017,Penny,Can’t stay long. I left Sheldon in the car with the window cracked open. He’s gonna go through that activity book in like 30 seconds so… Are you okay?
17018,Penny,This is amazing. How did you even get this idea?
17019,Sheldon,Well there’s no point in dwelling on it. As the Vulcans say Kup-fun-tor ha’kiv na’ish Du stau.
17020,Penny,Why?
17021,Leonard,Because we love each other.
17022,Howard,All right um how about oh how about Rocket Man?
17023,Raj,This is a treat what brings you guys by?
17024,Leonard,And I’m happy to report its kickstarter campaign is holding strong at zero dollars.
17025,Howard,Mm-hmm. How do you sleep in these things? Silk pajamas on satin sheets? I slid out of the bed like three times.
17026,Penny,Oh and there’s not even a bathroom on set. I have to go to the gas station across the street. I mean I was dressed like half an ape and still not even close to the most disgusting person in there.
17027,Howard,Okay. How Thelma and Louise of us.
17028,Leonard,Nothing. We just pulled an all-nighter trying to fix a zero-gravity… pasta maker. I’m gonna make a coffee run. Do you want any?
17029,Raj,You don’t have to make me anything.
17030,Leonard,What are you doing?
17031,Sheldon,How many women have you had dates with?
17032,Howard,Penny?
17033,Howard,USA Today calls them exuberant fun for the whole family.
17034,Raj,Cool. Can I say it fell apart because you were all I want to have your babies and I was like I’m too rock and roll to be tied down?
17035,Sheldon,Of course.
17036,Raj,You said I could buy a desk.
17037,Raj,What?
17038,Penny,Okay really I’m fine.
17039,Leonard,See? Ruined.
17040,Leonard,That is not true.
17041,Penny,That’s what it says on the packet.
17042,Leonard,I am here right? You see me.
17044,Sheldon,I don’t drink coffee.
17045,Sheldon, Penny.
17046,Leonard,Hey hey hey hey. This is my Comic-Con makeup. I love you but there are some things a man doesn’t share with his girlfriend.
17047,Sheldon,Um.
17048,Penny,Well it could be for the monkey movie. It could be my haemorrhoid commercial. The list does not go on.
17049,Penny,You need a break?
17050,Penny,What?
17051,Howard,I’m all for it.
17052,Howard,I really can’t thank you enough for taking me in. You know I was in a pretty low place in my life.
17053,Howard,Congratulations. Does it have that new car smell?
17054,Leonard,Uh sure that’s why I did it.
17055,Penny,Date night.
17056,Leonard,I change my answer. It it’s amazing. It’s hot. We can barely keep our hands off each other.
17057,Penny,That would explain why the sky was also on its side.
17058,Penny,Absolutely. You name it we’re doing it.
17059,Sheldon,Dried potatoes vegetable oil corn flower wheat starch maltodextrin salt and my favourite ingredient of all uniformity.
17060,Raj,Maybe I can save her.
17061,Raj,That was all a lie? This year’s gifts are already wrapped!
17062,Sheldon,Well I say that’s the last time we ever go outside.
17063,Leonard,Calm down Sheldon.
17064,Sheldon,There are post-prom mating rituals?
17065,Sheldon,I don’t understand.
17066,Penny,Wait. Honeyhave you ever run before?
17068,Sheldon,Ugh all right I’ll go. But from what I’ve seen his attention span is as limited as his bladder control.
17069,Leonard,Is that a big deal?
17070,Sheldon,No just because I’m living my life like it was 12 years ago doesn’t mean I’m delusional. And since it is 2003 I don’t know who you are so please exit the premises before I call the police on my stylish new flip phone.
17071,Leonard,Well we sort of decided to wing it.
17072,Leonard,Yes?
17073,Leonard,You mean for a person whose neck massages feel like an eagle is trying to carry you to its nest?
17074,Sheldon,Oh I’ve heard of that place isn’t that Pasadena’s favourite Irish watering hole.
17075,Penny,Yeah and Leonard and I are engaged now and I’m just hoping we can put this whole thing behind us.
17076,Penny,Hide you?
17077,Leonard,I gotta go.
17078,Sheldon,Remember when we camped out for the Doctor Who panel at Comic-Con?
17079,Raj,Yeah you’re like the Jar Jar Binks of the Hofstadter family.
17080,Penny,Um yeah Halloween.
17081,Sheldon,That’s your app idea?
17082,Leonard,Nary an argument? Nary?
17083,Penny,You know Sheldon I used to cut my brother’s hair. I could do it for you.
17084,Penny,It was a nice change of pace not eating takeout around a coffee table.
17085,Raj,Oh come on we’re in the telescope room. It’ll be like dining under the stars. You see this uh double zero? When it says zero one that means it’s twinkling. Sometimes it takes a while.
17086,Sheldon,Oh I see your confusion. You don’t understand. Indiana Jones was the one in the hat with the whip.
17087,Penny,Okay I have a question.
17088,Penny,Amy I’m fine.
17089,Sheldon,From hell’s heart I stab at thee.
17090,Penny,Wait hang on you guys are gonna work in a mine?
17091,Penny,Oh I’m sure he does it out of love. The same way my boyfriend makes me feel terrible about my life choices.
17092,Howard,Uh next?
17093,Leonard,He’s not lying he does find that fascinating.
17094,Leonard,Yeah. We also put in what happens if one of us wins a MacArthur Grant or if one of us gets superpowers or if one of us is bitten by a zombie.
17096,Raj,Hey Sheldon?
17097,Leonard,Yeah well if it’s a dollar you’re in luck.
17098,Raj,What am I looking at?
17099,Leonard,I’m sorry. The bride and groom seem happy.
17100,Howard,Aw I’m gonna miss you. Are you going with him?
17101,Sheldon,And how do you propose to do that? Uh hope you’re not thinking about some sort of LSD thought control. Because there’s only one mind-expanding drug that this man enjoys and that’s called school.
17102,Sheldon,The fun starts with brunch at Carney’s in Studio City a hot dog stand in a converted railroad dining car. Next stop Travel Town an outdoor museum featuring 43 railroad engines cars and other rolling stock from the 1880s to the 1930s. Finally we’re off to the glitz and glamour of Hollywood for dinner at that’s right the Hollywood Carney’s a hot dog stand in a different converted railroad dining car.
17103,Sheldon,Oh.
17104,Sheldon,Brown rice not white?
17105,Sheldon,If I’ve learned anything from British television shows on PBS it’s that servants dine downstairs with their own kind.
17106,Sheldon,I fashioned historically accurate undergarments out of linen.
17107,Sheldon,Yeah well you’re his girlfriend for now. You know maybe you’re not aware of this but there is a rich tradition of men at sea finding comfort in each other’s arms and britches.
17108,Sheldon,We’re not flying we’re taking the train.
17109,Penny,We thought you meant not letting him run out into traffic.
17110,Sheldon,Enjoy having the place to yourselves.
17111,Leonard,It’s gonna get crazy.
17112,Sheldon,Do you people even hear yourselves? It’s not the Wesley Crushers. It’s not the “Wesley” Crushers. It’s the Wesley “Crushers.”
17113,Penny,I’m uncomfortable Sheldon!
17115,Raj,No. See what I did there? I turned it around.
17116,Penny,See you boys. We are going drinking.
17117,Sheldon,I had a hundred and one fever. If that’s not a time to verbally abuse my loved ones when is?
17118,Leonard,What? Here? Now?
17119,Sheldon,When I first moved here I was nervous about finding a new barber so my mother had all my haircut records sent here to Mr. D’Onofrio.
17120,Sheldon,Yeah settle down there fake Wolowitz. No one likes a kiss-up.
17121,Sheldon,Oh relax. It was just her bottom and her breasts.
17122,Sheldon,She’s remarkable.
17123,Sheldon,Do you mean code red the hospital emergency alert code red the computer worm or code red the cherry flavoured soft drink from the makers of Mountain Dew?
17124,Penny,Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Look look look! I started a business.
17125,Leonard,Sometimes I like to turn this on and pretend I’m the super villain Magneto.
17126,Howard,Ah one name. Like uh Cher Madonna Adele. All the women who rock me. My name is Rajesh but you can call me Raj.
17127,Leonard,Okay.
17128,Sheldon,It’s my understanding that an unsolicited gift of food can be a precursor to an impromptu invitation to come in and chat.
17129,Penny,See ya. I’m dressed like a slob today too.
17130,Leonard,No I didn’t do it for the money.
17131,Sheldon,Howard you know me to be a very smart man. Don’t you think if I were wrong I’d know it?
17132,Leonard,No Penny it’s okay I can handle this. I’m not a dwarf I’m a Hobbit. A Hobbit. Are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus preventing the conversion from short-term to long-term memory?
17133,Howard,I laughed because the guy was Leonard.
17134,Penny,All right five. One two three four five. Oh wow look at that my Department of Defence research grant is renewed.
17135,Sheldon,What was I gonna do? Two ins in a row? Where’s my lemonade?
17136,Penny,Yeah I don’t know what that means.
17137,Howard,My cousin does work in a call centre.
17138,Penny,Oh sweetie I don’t think it even works as one. Is this all your clothes?
17140,Penny,Okay.
17141,Leonard,Here’s your tee-shirt. 
17143,Penny,What?
17144,Leonard,Oh now he’s a genius? All you ever do is make fun of him and engineering.
17145,Howard,That’s okay. I can come back later.
17146,Penny,How’s it going?
17147,Sheldon,I made a new friend who likes trains as much as I do uh I kissed Amy on the lips and uh the conductor played his banjo for me. Good night.
17148,Sheldon,Perhaps you should look with your eyes and not your muscular Nebraska man-hands.
17149,Howard,Leonard’s having astronomically inaccurate Star Trek sex with my sister.
17150,Leonard,Taking shorts off. There we go. Naked naked naked!
17151,Penny,It’s not free I’m gonna pay him back.  Shut up!
17152,Leonard,Oh you heard?
17154,Sheldon,You’re in my spot.
17156,Leonard,Did you just put a kick me sign on my back?
17157,Sheldon,I hadn’t thought about that.
17158,Howard,Okay where should I put them?
17159,Penny,How about instead of assuming I failed you ask me how it went?
17160,Sheldon,Who touched my…
17161,Leonard,Buildings that have a combination of copper and galvanized steel are susceptible to pinholes and corrosion caused by the mobility of ions in the water. Can’t have your head shoved in a toilet as much as I did and not pick up a few things about plumbing.
17162,Leonard,I’m glad you enjoyed it. Most people aren’t that interested in what I do.
17163,Penny,That you’d be willing to die a horrible death on the off-chance you’d get to second base?
17164,Leonard,I don’t know we came home from work and we found you.
17165,Raj,Just bust a move
17166,Leonard,Uh-huh I’m normally very nice but you shut up too.
17167,Howard,We’re here for you man. Whatever you need okay?
17168,Penny,Mm that one kind of looks like Bernadette.
17169,Howard,Really?
17170,Sheldon,Oh I’ve always valued education over money. And the very fact that you needed a written guarantee of respect made me realize how dismissive I’ve been of your contributions.
17171,Penny,Hey!
17172,Leonard,Oh for god’s sakes.
17173,Leonard,Why can’t he have a desk Sheldon?
17174,Sheldon,Will you two please inform Amy how much you enjoy adhering to a strict bathroom schedule?
17175,Sheldon,Hi.
17176,Raj,That isn’t Klingon it’s Yiddish for meat-filled dumpling.
17177,Sheldon,At this moment our relationship exists in two mutually contradictory states. Until you either do not go or go to Wil Wheaton’s party you are simultaneously my friend and not my friend. I’m characterizing this phenomenon as Schrodinger’s Friendship.
17178,Penny,Well maybe I mean it seems kind of perfect. I have sales experience and I’ve been a waitress so I have restaurant experience and if he’s figuring out my Christmas bonus we could buy a boat.
17179,Penny,I know. You’re safe.
17180,Howard,Oh cool I got a sword.
17181,Leonard,Yeah I guess.
17182,Howard,Uh wait can I come with you? My character died.
17183,Leonard,It’s crunchy. Just the way I like it.
17184,Leonard,Nope.
17185,Raj,No no. I’m just evolving as a musician. You’re the one who’s stuck in the past.
17186,Sheldon,Ooh! Speaking of good news somebody just hit 100 Twitter followers.
17187,Sheldon,Is it because of the conflict that arises from your desperate need to pair-bond with a woman and the apparent collective decision of all womankind to deny you that opportunity?
17188,Leonard,I don’t know. Just tell them I went to the office.
17189,Leonard,Mm not really.
17190,Penny,That just can’t be right.
17191,Leonard,I’m not pressuring you.
17192,Leonard,Afraid so Skippy.
17193,Sheldon,Good luck.
17195,Raj,Just because he helps me out doesn’t automatically mean that I’m spoiled.
17196,Leonard,What alibi?
17197,Sheldon,Oh it’s used incorrectly all the time. Even Bill Murray makes that mistake in the first scene of Ghostbusters.
17198,Raj,I don’t think so. She sounded pretty upset.
17199,Leonard,What was it doing on the ceiling?
17200,Penny,What’s wrong with cute?
17201,Leonard,Oh.
17202,Sheldon,Leonard promise me that when our new waitress comes over you will not start a complicated on-again off-again relationship with her because I am very very hungry.
17203,Sheldon,Good Lord I could not have made this easier. Hydrogen atom H plus pigs minus pea Higgs. Bow General Zod trapped in the Phantom Zone. Bow-zone. Pear. Tickle. Pear-tickle. Higgs Boson Particle. How could you not get that?
17204,Sheldon,It says here you’re a chemist. Which element on the periodic table do you feel is too big for its britches?
17205,Sheldon,I suppose there’s no choice but to face the crying angry accusations and the high-pitched wails of despair.
17206,Penny,So I just came by to see how you were doing.
17207,Sheldon,Well if you’ll excuse me I’m going to go do work that promises significant results as opposed to what you do which does not. Yeah you heard me.
17208,Leonard,You know on some level I’ve always believed that I don’t deserve a woman like her.
17209,Sheldon,Oh good Lord are we going to stand here and listen to him tear Leonard apart like this?
17211,Penny,Oh Howard heads up. Your ex-girlfriend just came in for her shift.
17212,Leonard,Uh Raj can I can I talk to you for a moment.
17213,Sheldon,Now Navajo.
17214,Leonard,You left out got chafed testicles because you no longer wear underpants.
17215,Sheldon,Arthur? Arthur it’s me Sheldon Cooper. You may not remember because of your advanced age.
17216,Leonard,Exactly. They say it finally solves the submarine controversy.
17217,Leonard,Its not that I’d stopped trying its just how relationships progress. They start with infatuation but over time mellow into something more comfortable.
17218,Penny,Well I was too busy standing up for my friend to worry about your I want to say salmon.
17219,Leonard,Oh yeah. Wasn’t that the basis of your postdoc fellowship?
17220,Leonard,What?
17221,Penny,Well in the first grade my friend Rosie and I made a pact to marry Bert and Ernie. You know from Sesame Street?
17222,Penny,Well I thought we’d start with some basic movement exercises. You know get our bodies warmed up a little.
17223,Sheldon,I thought the zero-gravity toilet didn’t work.
17224,Penny,Tell me the truth. Am I just an idiot who picks giant losers?
17225,Howard,What kind of needs?
17226,Raj,Hey guys.
17227,Raj,Hey I didn’t even mention Dum Dum Dugan or Green Goblin Matt Murdock Pepper Potts Victor Von Doom oh and worst of all Millie the Model.
17228,Howard,No no no no! That rate is much too low for what we’d expect from this collision. Do you understand that we’re talking about dark matter colliding in outer space?
17229,Leonard,Look at us. Getting ready for a double date with actual women who publicly acknowledge they’re our girlfriends.
17230,Raj,Hey while you decide who was better in bed big hot Zack or wheezy little Leonard? Neener neener.
17231,Howard,You know he won’t be looking at other girls.
17232,Sheldon,You know what I’m going to do? I am going to sit here and just let them stew.
17233,Leonard,So are we going to talk about last night?
17234,Raj,I don’t know. Do you think this is really Hillary Clinton doing it with Oprah?
17235,Howard,Good day Mrs. Davis. This is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali from the astrophysics department. Don’t be alarmed I’m not really in space. Anyhoo I’d like to take this opportunity to tell you about myself so sit back relax and enjoy the following 90-minute video.
17236,Sheldon,No.
17237,Sheldon,That would be acceptable. On Mondays I eat Thai food. Mee krob and chicken sate with extra peanut sauce from Siam Palace.
17238,Leonard,Unbelievable.
17239,Raj,No!
17240,Howard,Yeah I’m here because I think it’s gonna be like Game of Thrones.
17241,Raj,Why wouldn’t you take Penny?
17242,Raj,I don’t know. Maybe it’s all those steroids I’ve been taking.
17243,Leonard,What? Is there a switch on the back of his neck we don’t know about?
17244,Leonard,That’s fascinating but I…
17245,Sheldon,Not even a cozy sleeper car on the Orient Express?
17246,Leonard,Oh my God you’re jealous.
17247,Leonard,Fine. Then we’ll just stay here and do it.
17248,Leonard,I grew up in a house full of crazy academics. Instead of leaving Santa milk and cookies we had to leave him a research paper. And in the morning you could tell he’d been there because the paper would be graded.
17249,Sheldon,The internet’s been down for half an hour.
17250,Howard,Okay that’s not so bad. You know what happened to the scientists that worked on the Manhattan Project? The government forced them to move to the desert. They had to live in secret and when Oppenheimer objected to what they made him do they destroyed his reputation.
17251,Sheldon,Defend.
17252,Penny,Sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry.
17253,Leonard,I’ve got my helm of lordly might my boots of speed and if things get too exciting my inhaler of asthma.
17255,Leonard,Sounds great.
17256,Penny,What? She didn’t give me any puzzles.
17257,Leonard,Nope it was better before.
17258,Leonard,You’re right you’re lost good luck.
17259,Howard,Ha-a-a. Still funny.
17260,Raj,Incredibly so.
17261,Howard,That’s because in your dreams you’re a horse from the waist down.
17262,Raj,You mean one of the hopeless geeks? No. Those are crazy people. Howard be a dear and get me another one of these. Now him he’s one of those geeks.
17263,Howard,I have a hip-hop aerobics class at five could we go after?
17264,Penny,Is that why you had to take him to Office Depot last night?
17265,Howard,This is not a safe place. You can’t share anything here.
17266,Leonard,Why don’t we just put the money in a joint account? It’ll be our first money together. We can use it for the wedding the honeymoon whatever.
17267,Penny,Oh. Why didn’t I put money on this?  Hey that’s my agent. If I got the part it’s still the second best thing I’ve heard all day. Hello?
17268,Leonard,Two can play this game. Penny…
17269,Howard,Look the problem with commencement speeches is that they’re boring. Ooh do you own a T-shirt cannon?
17270,Penny,You know I’m surprised you want to copy my answers since I’m not even smart enough to be on your team.
17271,Sheldon,I am not a loser. Pictionary is not a true test of any real intelligence or skill.
17272,Leonard,Hey.
17273,Raj,Oh God never again.
17274,Penny,Womenfolk?
17275,Howard,You want to go shopping?
17276,Howard,Hey Stuart.
17277,Leonard,Hey.
17278,Raj,Man I’m worn out.
17279,Sheldon,Hmm. Beats me. Now I know Hawking’s not busy because I can see he’s playing other people right now.
17280,Leonard,Absolutely. I just want you to be happy. And maybe a little turned on about how selfless I’m being.
17281,Sheldon,The parade.
17282,Leonard,Hi.
17284,Leonard,Alright alright. Well uh nevertheless I have one now and I would appreciate it if you would you know make yourself scarce.
17285,Sheldon,Oh fine. We don’t have to have a roommate agreement meeting if you don’t want to.
17286,Penny,Hey Sheldon.
17287,Leonard,Well I’m sure you have a lot of good applicants I just wanted to say hi and let you know that I’ll be throwing my hat in the ring.
17288,Sheldon, Guess who?
17289,Leonard,Yeah. Listen I have to kinda sneak out for a while.
17290,Penny,Ooh.
17292,Sheldon,I said name one. You really need to work on your listening skills.
17293,Leonard,That happened to you?
17294,Raj,I’ve got some feelers out. In the meantime listen to this.
17295,Sheldon,My apologies. I chose my words poorly. I should have said you were about to have your world rocked on my couch. Anyway thank you for watching it. It’s one of my all-time favourites.
17296,Raj,Hey I let you peel the plastic don’t get greedy.  Hello?
17297,Howard,Oh I’m sorry is that politically incorrect? In India we just call them untouchables.
17298,Leonard,Uh uh uh hang on. Do you think we’d really drift apart if we both became successful?
17299,Penny,You know what? I just realized I’m on a break. I’ll get someone else.
17300,Penny,Is he? I never noticed.
17301,Sheldon,Wow. I’m starting to think you didn’t mean it when you said you wanted to spruce up the place.
17302,Raj,What if we reposition the collection tank?
17303,Raj,So what’s up?
17304,Penny,Okay let me put it this way if you’re really Leonard’s friend you will support him no matter who he wants to be with.
17305,Sheldon,I prefer to think of it as I’m pulling them forward.
17306,Sheldon,Action.
17307,Sheldon,For how…
17308,Howard,I thought about what you said last night and I went back on the dating Web site and I was looking at this girl’s profile. She’s amazing.
17309,Leonard,How can 5 not be worse than 1?
17310,Penny,I have. You are not wrong. I just think if we’re gonna try dating again we should take things slow.
17311,Leonard,Yeah I feel terrible.
17312,Penny,Gotcha.
17313,Sheldon,Now will you give my paper to Hawking?
17314,Howard,Howard there must be someone at the university you can go to for help.
17316,Penny,What do you mean? . Oh! Wow!
17317,Penny,Not the drinking game a drinking game.
17318,Sheldon,Howard I’m trying to make myself uncomfortable not everyone else.
17319,Leonard,Sheldon took our order.
17320,Penny,Be safe and call us.
17321,Raj,Stop that? Okay.
17322,Sheldon,Well I pray when I’m dead and the ages shall roll that my body will blacken and turn into coal.
17323,Howard,I’m in a hot tub with you so pretty bad.
17324,Raj,He’s living at my place so I’m living here.
17325,Raj,I still love it. I just think there’s room for improvement.
17326,Sheldon,Wow. Pouting and running away actually worked. I must say that may not be a lesson you want to reinforce with me. So um what is the solution?
17327,Leonard,Because she’s your sister.
17328,Sheldon,Great.
17329,Sheldon,Am I allowed to inform him that Colonel Sanders was never actually in the military?
17330,Raj,Mrs Bell was deaf she’s not even going to hear you knock.
17332,Raj,I don’t think it matters. Look Sheldon I believe when the time is right for you to meet someone it’ll just happen. Okay? Not because of a test or a Web site but because…  we are the dreamers of dreams.
17333,Howard,Hey what’s up?
17334,Leonard,Wow you remember that?
17335,Penny,What does that mean?
17336,Howard,Hey did I say something to upset you?
17337,Leonard,It’s not a big deal. Go shopping with Amy and we’ll save a spot in line for you.
17338,Penny,Hey what’s my share?
17339,Sheldon,Before taxes.
17340,Leonard,No this has to stop now.
17341,Sheldon,Well I’ll give you three guesses why I’m so irritated.
17342,Leonard,Hi.
17343,Leonard,Too expensive. You’d think I’d be used to women withholding their love. I mean my mother did. I mean no matter how hard I tried she just didn’t have any interest in me.
17345,Leonard,Oh thank you but I’m okay.
17346,Howard,Indy’s young sidekick from Temple of Doom.
17347,Sheldon,The reaction will be triggered when Kripke reaches the center of the room. Mwah ha ha.
17348,Penny,Okay sweetie I think that’s the grasshopper talking.
17349,Howard,Well don’t be too mean.
17350,Sheldon,G-rated with a warning for families with babies and toddlers.
17351,Raj,He’s right. If you think about it we’re all in charge.
17352,Penny,Oh good you’re up. Look my car won’t start. I need a ride to work.
17353,Sheldon,Impressive as that may be Monte is not us. Monte has no fear.
17354,Penny,You know for the first couple of months whenever I would take off my bra he would giggle and say oh boy my breast friends.
17355,Sheldon,To help. Look if you fail at this relationship and history suggests you will then we risk losing the medical officer that our landing party has always needed.
17356,Howard,Yeah see if you just change the story to the destruction of our galaxy then a super massive black hole could work.
17357,Howard,You really think so?
17358,Sheldon,Ugh this again. Amy I’ve already had one new hole torn in my body today. I don’t need another one.
17359,Penny,Anything you want okay? Any costume you want. Bye.
17360,Raj,I worked on it all night. Use it.
17361,Sheldon,No no no Leonard gets nauseous unless he sits in front and even then it’s iffy.
17362,Penny,Some girl named Mandy.
17363,Sheldon,Right. I’ll make tea.
17364,Sheldon,No but my mother assured me they were sent here and I’ll bet you dollars to doughnuts that this one doesn’t have them. Uh excuse me. Do you have access to my haircut records?
17365,Sheldon,Any chance that restaurant is near Griffith Park?
17366,Sheldon,Well there’s one beloved children’s book I’ll never read again.
17367,Sheldon,Oh no you know I’m not really the holding kind of… Oh!
17368,Sheldon,It’s dark matter. When I entered the field of string theory I was a prodigy. I rose to a position of respect and I assumed my career would continue on that upward trajectory. Now here I am in my 30s I’m back at square one. And frankly it’s frightening.
17369,Sheldon,Do you think they’re gonna call the police?
17370,Penny,Ugh I am so embarrassed!
17371,Sheldon,Yeah but what if it’s Property of U.S. Government? There’s a national helium reserve in Amarillo Texas. If this was stolen from there we’re accessories to a federal crime.
17372,Sheldon,My stature intimidates her so she’s using you to get to me. Crafty old gal.
17373,Sheldon,Another way of saying that is the movie starts at midnight and it’s already five o’clock. Let’s go.
17374,Howard,Hey uh can I run something by you? It’s about Lakshmi.
17375,Sheldon,So it’s like the musical equivalent of Russell’s Paradox the question of whether the set of all sets that don’t contain themselves as members contains itself?
17376,Leonard,That’s kind of between me and…
17377,Raj,Hello.
17378,Penny,Don’t push it Leonard.
17379,Penny,Party’s over! Party’s over!
17380,Penny,Um a psychiatrist. Why?
17381,Sheldon,I know how you feel. The Best Buy by my house is only the third best Best Buy. They have the best buys but having the best buys isn’t the only thing that makes a Best Buy the best Best Buy.
17383,Leonard,Look just because we took our friend in does not mean that Penny and I are afraid to be alone.
17384,Leonard,Where did you go to school?
17385,Sheldon,That’s true but had I done something under the line there wouldn’t be a man in your kitchen who can’t produce a single form of ID.
17386,Raj,What is wrong with you?
17387,Penny,I’m gonna go talk to her.
17388,Howard,But uh before I take my shirt off I just need like ten minutes to do some crunches.
17389,Leonard,Not gonna happen.
17390,Sheldon,It is glorious. One of the greatest intellects of our time has agreed to engage with me in a gentlemanly battle of wits. And I’m spanking him so hard his grad students won’t be able to sit down.
17391,Sheldon,We are winged fury! Which is still no excuse for going over the posted speed limit.
17392,Howard,Hey Sheldon I’m sorry.
17393,Leonard,Oh no not Glenn?
17394,Penny,Oh yeah let me show you the ring.
17395,Leonard,It’s not a big deal. He’s just in her history class. They’re working on a project together. I don’t even know why I care. You know what I don’t care.
17396,Sheldon,Well she’s very fond of her silver one that says allergic to penicillin. Maybe they have a dressier version of that?
17397,Leonard,Are you really going to be on NPR?
17398,Penny,Yeah. That’s why I’m going to skip over it. Are you saying that Amy is oh what’s the
17399,Penny,Wow. Anything else?
17400,Leonard,Little bit yeah.
17401,Howard,It’s a good sign.
17402,Leonard,You proposed the experiment I think you should present your findings first.
17403,Leonard,For the same reason I don’t wear the apron or the hair net.
17404,Sheldon,Why not?
17405,Leonard,There is a generally accepted pattern in this area I would pick you up take you to a restaurant then we would see a movie probably a romantic comedy featuring the talents of Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock.
17406,Sheldon,The flags of Liechtenstein and Haiti were identical by coincidence a fact that wasn’t discovered until they competed against each other at the 1936 Olympics. And thankfully their embarrassment was overshadowed by the rise of Fascism.
17408,Penny,Okay first of all it is not man after man.
17409,Sheldon,I won’t say that all senior citizens who can’t master technology should be publicly flogged but if we made an example of one or two it might give the others incentive to try harder.
17410,Leonard,She’s right a committee that important should meet more often.
17411,Leonard,Can’t we just postpone it till the spring? Maybe next summer?
17412,Raj,Uh no it’s uh pretty private actually it’s over his garage. So the only time I’ll see him is when he pulls his car in does his laundry or practices drums in my dining room.
17413,Sheldon,Hold on. I have to figure out how to get the bucket so I can carry the mud past the dragon.
17414,Penny,Didn’t.
17416,Raj,Yeah.
17417,Leonard,Here’s the thing I I’m not one of those guys who sneaks around and sleeps with more than one woman.
17418,Sheldon,Ah the worst for last. Hmm. Classic Flakey.
17419,Penny,Yeah obviously.
17421,Sheldon,Zack I’m sorry you’re stupid. Have a Milk Dud.
17422,Raj,What’s the first one?
17423,Leonard,Mmm doesn’t matter. Half the time he just ends up playing with the box.
17424,Howard,Dude I I think that’s Nathan Fillion.
17425,Leonard,I’m going too I’ll show you where it is.
17426,Leonard,Yes obviously.
17427,Penny,Really?
17428,Raj,Ooh somebody took pictures and uploaded them to their Flickr account.
17429,Raj,Would you look at this? I paid twenty five dollars to some kid on eBay for a handcrafted Harry Potter wand. He sent me a stick. He went into his backyard he picked up a stick.
17430,Sheldon,How is Deep Space Nine better than Saturn 3?
17431,Sheldon,That being said we have to discuss the implementation of the agreed upon “cohabitation” rider which has been activated now that the two of you are living together.
17432,Sheldon,So?
17433,Sheldon,Isn’t this nice?
17434,Leonard,Tell you what the surgery’s not for a week I’ll think about it.
17435,Howard,So does that mean we can go with the girls again?
17436,Sheldon,Thank you.
17437,Penny,I see it.
17438,Leonard,Penny you’re up.
17440,Leonard,How am I supposed to sleep? I’ve been married less than 24 hours and my wife isn’t speaking to me.
17441,Raj,No. Bought this at the Staples Center when I went to see Taylor Swift.
17442,Sheldon,Nobel Prize acceptance ceremony streaming live from Stockholm.
17443,Sheldon,Well alright but I don’t see this as a promising endeavour.
17444,Howard,She said she recently went on a date with a guy named Roger? And he’s Indian? And he’s an astrophysicist too?
17445,Penny,But you like it so much.
17446,Sheldon,Mmmmm!
17448,Leonard,Yeah why would you do that?
17449,Leonard,I am not going to fold.
17450,Penny,So busy.
17451,Sheldon,You know it turns out you can hurt people just as well without ’em.
17452,Raj,And you just let him?
17453,Howard,Well give me a chance you don’t even know me.
17454,Leonard,See the liquid metal Terminators were created in the future by Skynet and Skynet was developed by Miles Dyson but that future no longer exists due to Dyson’s death in Terminator 2.
17455,Howard,Okay guys go ahead and divide yourselves into teams of two.
17456,Penny,Hey if you guys were hungry why didn’t you order something at the restaurant?
17457,Penny,No still hideous.
17458,Raj,Is that a real thing?
17459,Raj,All right. 
17460,Raj,Oh I am I am. I I guess I’m still wondering if Emily and I are right for each other.
17462,Leonard,Well I understand too.
17463,Sheldon,Got it.
17464,Leonard,Good. Glad is good.
17465,Leonard,Why do I always have to carry the heavy stuff?
17466,Sheldon,Well seems what’s on the menu tonight is malarkey with a big side of poppycock.
17467,Sheldon,Where do I begin?
17469,Sheldon,Whose house is this?
17470,Sheldon,I disagree. Your inability to successfully woo Penny long predates your acquisition of the time machine. That failure clearly stands on its own.
17471,Leonard,What happened to Elliot Wong?
17472,Leonard,Oh this is neat. Think about all the action figures we’ve bought over the years. It would be kind of cool to have ones that look like us. Don’t you think?
17473,Leonard,You know what’d be nice? Name it after your girlfriends. Show them how much you care.
17474,Sheldon,No. Um since last we spoke have you planned or gone on any vacations?
17475,Penny,I don’t care I was in junior rodeo I can hogtie and castrate him in 60 seconds.
17476,Raj,So walk home.
17477,Sheldon,Go ahead it’s pre-loosened.
17478,Leonard,It’s nine o’clock where you been?
17479,Leonard,Fine.
17480,Leonard,I don’t want to listen to music Sheldon.
17481,Sheldon,My room is paid up until the end of the month so I can do with it whatever I please which includes renting it out for a dollar a night.
17482,Raj,Uh.
17483,Howard,Yeah you’re like the Jar Jar Binks of the Hofstadter family.
17484,Howard,Your guy Eddie Crispo?
17485,Raj,I don’t know maybe drive down to Hollywood hit a few hot spots see if I can get lucky.
17486,Raj,Who were you respecting then?
17487,Sheldon,A moment ago when you turned off the TV in the middle of }during the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode. Would you like some advice?
17488,Leonard,What?
17489,Leonard,Oh I can’t take all the credit. You helped a lot.
17490,Leonard,You wrote a paper on my idea?
17491,Sheldon,Well if he does do you know how filthy those rental balls are? They might as well stand on the corner and give away free rectal exams.
17492,Raj,You know I heard of this way of watching the movies called the Machete Order where you watch Episodes IV and V then skip Episode I watch II and III as a flashback and then finish with VI.
17493,Sheldon,You say that now but consider the following scenario you’re sitting in your apartment it’s late you’re alone your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup of estrogen and progesterone and suddenly even Leonard seems like a viable sexual candidate or a uh hookup as it’s referred to by today’s urban youth.
17494,Sheldon,I go to the bathroom like everybody else.
17495,Sheldon,Illogical. Oh damn it Spock you’re right. I’ll do it.
17496,Sheldon,November 16? Penny that’s the evening you fell in your bathtub and I had to drive you to the emergency room.
17497,Leonard,Okay first of all the surgery was a success and secondly I didn’t even want you there.
17498,Leonard,Sheldon I think this will work. Let’s just try it my way.
17499,Leonard,Oh great.
17500,Leonard,My mommy raised a gentleman.
17501,Raj,Hey guys guys President Siebert is headed this way.
17502,Leonard,Really? The guy who for years couldn’t even talk to women is suddenly going out with two of them? How is that possible?
17503,Leonard,Uh it’s more complicated than that.
17504,Sheldon,Amusing. A play on the two meanings of cobbler.
17505,Sheldon,I couldn’t agree more.
17506,Raj,Why would you leave like that?
17507,Raj,What are you drinking?
17508,Penny,What are you doing?
17509,Leonard,Sorry.
17510,Leonard,Now we’re going as Hulk and She-Hulk. I don’t want to take my shirt off at Comic-Con.
17511,Sheldon,Leonard where are you?
17512,Leonard,Howard it’s Leonard code Milky Green.
17513,Howard,Fine I’ll put it on Facebook like a caveman.
17514,Sheldon,Do people know about her? ‘Cause she’s delightful.
17515,Leonard,Exactly. Yeah you have a good grasp of the physics.
17516,Sheldon,Yes you were very natural in front of the camera and I found your suggestions extremely helpful.
17517,Leonard,Should we have invited her for lunch?
17518,Leonard,Because your friend was rude to her and then you went to dinner with him.
17519,Sheldon,It’s actually British.
17520,Raj,This is all your fault I should’ve listened to Mun-Mun because I’ve been playing with a cobra and her name is Penny. Why are you so cruel? Do you enjoy my pain?
17521,Penny,Get up.
17522,Penny,Mm.
17524,Raj,Really? Well oh okay one mystery solved.
17525,Penny,Eight years?
17526,Sheldon,Yes I believe so.
17527,Leonard,The cultural paradigm in which people have sex after three dates.
17528,Leonard,He’s at the train station.
17529,Penny,Good night.
17530,Leonard,Oh cool. That cute blonde on four?
17531,Sheldon,Sarcasm?
17532,Penny,Oh right. Yeah we can do something.
17533,Leonard,Totally.
17534,Sheldon,Oh I would assume we’d enjoy insects or smaller lizards. We could also pull each other’s tails off and grill them they’ll just grow back. Oh! My life-size cardboard Mr. Spock is here! I know he wouldn’t care for an outburst of human emotion but oh goodie oh goodie oh goodie. Commander Spock requesting permission to be unfolded.
17535,Howard,I kind of like chicken fingers.
17536,Penny,Yeah kind of.
17537,Penny,What that already happened?
17538,Sheldon,Perhaps Howard meant passive-aggressive like asking our group to help on your project and then only choosing Leonard.
17539,Raj,Thank you.
17540,Sheldon,Good. Let’s begin with the premise that everything you’ve done up to this point is wrong.
17541,Howard,What do you want?
17542,Leonard,So you could teach me?
17544,Sheldon,Camouflaging bald spots. That’s primarily a male concern. Perhaps we could expand our market.
17545,Sheldon,Good morning. See? I didn’t knock but it’s fine. I didn’t knock but it’s fine. I didn’t knock but it’s fine. So how is everyone?
17546,Howard,Well so then we start the game over until there’s a winner.
17547,Leonard,Me neither but what other choice do we have?
17548,Leonard,Nothing I’m fine.
17549,Howard,What’s your mom going to say if you call off the wedding?
17551,Leonard,Hey how about that Asian fusion place?
17552,Howard,What happened with Leslie why did she dump you?
17553,Raj,How about “Die toaster die”?
17554,Penny,So instead she asked if in the future Montana ever became a state.
17555,Leonard,Papaya?
17556,Penny,Raj come here. This girl is trouble. I mean what kind of relationship is it where you buy her gifts and she gives you sex?
17557,Sheldon,That’s the rankest psychologism and was conclusively revealed as hogwash by Gottlob Frege in the 1890s!
17558,Raj,I feel bad for Bert.
17559,Sheldon,Oh dear Mr. D’Onofrio’s in the hospital. Why do these things always happen to me?
17560,Raj,But theoretically if you and I were in a gay relationship how would we tell people? Like print up announcements?
17561,Sheldon,What so you thought I was going to be alone for the rest of my life?
17562,Raj,Did you get in?
17563,Raj,Oh. Very clever. But still racist.
17564,Howard,Three.
17565,Raj,Did you sign this?
17566,Penny,Leonard remember when I said it was on? Well now it’s junior rodeo on.
17567,Sheldon,How do you know anything about physics?
17568,Leonard,You having second thoughts about acting?
17569,Penny,Then why did you embarrass me in front of my friend who by the way knew exactly who you were?
17570,Sheldon,Oh Ubuntu you are my favourite Linux-based operating system.
17571,Penny,This is like the worst Hollywood tour ever.
17572,Penny,On the other hand we might lack a certain maturity.
17573,Leonard,Oh it’s just nice to be with people who are happy to have me around. Isn’t that right Halley?
17574,Penny,Female jibber jabber?
17575,Howard,So never.
17576,Leonard,Are you sure?
17577,Howard,We’re on a quest through the Valley of Fire to acquire the sacred crown.
17578,Howard,Uh I’d say by three.
17579,Howard,Oh sure you can tell when Sheldon’s upset.
17580,Leonard,Thank you.
17581,Penny,Here’s a question as an alien pretending to be human are you planning to engage in any post-prom mating rituals with Amy?
17582,Leonard,I was reading about this jellyfish that never dies. Instead it reverts to its asexual state and then grows up again.
17583,Sheldon,Old comic book. I just retrieved it from my safe deposit box.
17584,Howard,Wait! Give me the number! Give me the number! Give me the number!
17585,Penny,Hi.
17586,Leonard,Wow.
17587,Leonard,Good boy. Here’s a cookie.
17588,Leonard,That’s funny. By the way my leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.
17589,Penny,Then what did you mean?
17590,Penny,Hey.
17591,Howard,These cards have barcodes on them. The wand is a reader. It’s transmitting to your phone.
17592,Raj,Didn’t even crack the top ten.
17593,Leonard,I have asthma. Back off.
17594,Raj,Really?
17595,Leonard, Look at that it is a party.
17596,Leonard,How long is he going to stay here.
17597,Raj,Of course. I’m always packing. Anyway um I had trouble putting it on and you tried to help and that was all she wrote.
17598,Penny,I don’t even run there I drive.
17599,Raj,It was like a snowy nightmare from which there was no awakening.
17600,Penny,I love it.
17601,Leonard,Come on.
17602,Penny,Nothing.
17603,Penny,No. All you need is a needle and an ice cube. I’ve done it like a dozen times.
17604,Howard,So when they ride horses and fly on the birds they also use their ponytails.
17605,Penny,Ooh burn!
17606,Leonard,Yes.
17607,Leonard,Okay that’s enough Howard. The poor guy’s had a tough time. He had to spend the entire afternoon in jail wearing that suit.
17608,Penny,I can’t believe you punched Bert.
17609,Howard,Oh. Hang on. You got a you got a little something. Ah.
17610,Leonard,What are you doing?
17611,Sheldon,Excuse me. I’m uncomfortable with you recommending that Leonard pursue having intercourse with Dr. Plimpton who I assure you has better things to do.
17612,Sheldon,Very well then. I’ll see you on Thanksgiving morning.
17613,Sheldon,We do?
17614,Sheldon,No. Why is everyone so obsessed with Amy and Stuart? And whether or not they may be having more pumpkin lattes or intercourse tonight.
17615,Sheldon,Drat. No Frodo for you.
17616,Leonard,Well of course not.
17617,Sheldon,Wuh wuh hold on excuse me that’s my room.
17618,Sheldon,When can I stab one of my friends?
17619,Howard,Oh we are bad boys aren’t we?
17620,Penny,You are welcome. Yeah I’m gonna have to move.
17621,Leonard,Sad?
17622,Howard,That’s the only logical inference.
17623,Sheldon,I can’t go in today. I’m sick.
17624,Leonard,Of course you’re not. People love trained monkeys.
17625,Sheldon,No no that’s true gravity would have been apparent to me without the apple.
17626,Leonard,Sorry. Do you think I’m overdressed?
17627,Sheldon,Oh I overdid it myself last night. Hair of the dog.
17628,Penny,I’m… I’m sorry.
17629,Leonard,Don’t worry baby I’ve got you.
17630,Penny,Monkeys.
17631,Penny,No of course not. I just I didn’t think it would make me have all these feelings.
17632,Howard,That is so cool.
17633,Sheldon,She’s not that intelligent.
17634,Sheldon,What now do you have company?
17635,Leonard,I don’t have a problem with Stuart. Besides he gives us a twenty percent discount at his comic book store.
17636,Leonard,Okay why?
17637,Sheldon,Well based on your reaction it looks like I made the right choice. Isn’t that right Giuseppe?
17638,Sheldon,Hey I thought you were sweet on me.
17639,Sheldon,You’re the one who told me to play with it.
17641,Sheldon,I must admit I can’t help but feel a twinge of envy. He can look out the window and see the majesty of the universe unfolding before his eyes. His dim uncomprehending eyes. It’s like a cat in an airport carrying case.
17642,Leonard,I noticed you never answered me.
17643,Leonard,I don’t know what you’re upset about. I’m the one who’s losing.
17644,Sheldon,Well no I just I I don’t want to recycle it. And I don’t want store credit.
17645,Leonard,And control it how?
17646,Sheldon,Yeah we could get Thai food near your apartment and then drop in and check on the progress.
17647,Howard,Here let me try. You’re right it doesn’t turn the other way.
17648,Penny,Then we found out we both wanted Ernie. We didn’t speak again until middle school.
17649,Sheldon,You have a sarcasm sign?
17650,Penny,I don’t want five dollars. I want my dignity.
17651,Penny,Nope.
17652,Leonard,Keep going.
17653,Sheldon,I know. It makes its own gravy it’ll slide right down.
17654,Sheldon,That’s ridiculous.
17655,Penny,Exactly.
17656,Penny,That’s great.
17657,Penny,Wil Wheaton is Sheldon’s mortal enemy.
17658,Leonard,I didn’t know they gave Nobel prizes for making boom-boom in the potty.
17659,Leonard,Sheldon…
17660,Penny,Yes yes he’s working for the government on an infinite persistence gyroscope. Of course the first time I say it right he’s not even here.
17661,Leonard,What did you do put this in your tea?
17662,Penny,Hey.
17663,Penny,No.
17664,Leonard,Oh come on. This is stupid.
17665,Sheldon,Why?
17666,Leonard,No I I mean it was good. There were just a few things that needed a little polishing.
17667,Sheldon,Beverley believes I unconsciously consider my old room an escape hatch.
17668,Leonard,Then what are you?
17669,Sheldon,Okay well I have a sound effect for those sound effects. 
17670,Penny,Yes.
17671,Sheldon,No after you as we are currently crushing you Wesley.
17672,Howard,How can you be so racist?
17673,Leonard,What about the ones in the corner?
17674,Sheldon,Let’s box it up.
17675,Penny,Uh well honey you know now that Leonard and I are married it kind of makes sense that we actually live together.
17676,Penny,Haven’t you seen that movie like a thousand times?
17677,Penny,Is that so?
17678,Howard,Really you don’t have to go to any trouble.
17679,Sheldon,Yeah it did but luckily all my photos got backed up to the Cloud.
17680,Leonard,Boy you will not let this go will you? Oh jeez.
17681,Sheldon,Well now I just feel silly holding it.
17682,Raj,I am making her comfortable. Besides she’s not sleeping here half the time anyway.
17683,Howard,It is awesome. Uh you should probably go after her.
17684,Sheldon,Bueno mi amigo.
17686,Sheldon,Jacuzzi is a commercial brand. Hot tub is the generic term i.e. all Jacuzzis are hot tubs but not all hot tubs are Jacuzzis.
17687,Penny,Oh!
17688,Penny,No.
17689,Leonard,By stalking them?
17690,Sheldon,Come on buddy. Let’s not waste another second on this loser. Love your house.
17691,Sheldon,I do but why do you care if I celebrate my birthday at all?
17692,Sheldon,I think they say junk.
17694,Sheldon,Three giant red ones and they never blink. It’s unsettling.
17696,Howard,I like the new look.
17697,Howard,Hang on.
17698,Leonard,No no. We cover ourselves in body paint and then then we get on this big canvas and do our thing.
17699,Penny,I don’t know. Maybe ’cause things are going so well between us lately and I’ve been really happy.
17700,Raj,So?
17701,Sheldon,Keep a lookout. This place is swarming with campus security. They will not hesitate to scold us.
17702,Sheldon,It’s remarkable. All that time spent in fear. And for what? He’s magnificent. Oh dear. I just realized I haven’t offered you a beverage.
17703,Leonard,Sorry Leslie I guess I prefer my space stringy not loopy.
17704,Sheldon,No Fig Newtons are named after a small town in Massachusetts. Don’t write that down!
17705,Howard,Hold on. Isn’t there something else you wanted to tell him?
17706,Leonard,Because I’m afraid to know the answer.
17707,Penny,Oh yeah that. Come on in.
17708,Penny,Now honey I already told you the hamburger meat is fresh and stored at a safe temperature.
17709,Leonard,You know what? Let’s just get a pizza.
17710,Raj,They’re on the chair right over… Oy vey.
17711,Sheldon,Yeah 1-2-3-4 is not a secure password.
17712,Sheldon,No Of course you’re not. All right ten dollars a day times five days a week times 52 weeks a year is two thousand six hundred dollars.
17713,Penny,Participate in the what?
17714,Raj,Does she really mean that or was she signing it sarcastically?
17715,Penny,That’s different. I’m not going to the mall with someone dressed like a dumb space bear.
17716,Sheldon,I’m not going. Would you like to know why?
17717,Howard,Okay nice talking to you.
17718,Howard,Why do you bounce with your hands in the air like that?
17719,Penny,What’s the difference?
17720,Sheldon,So if she wants to end her pair-bond with Leonard why on earth would she guzzle a witches’ brew of his soda and spit?
17721,Penny,Yeah Leonard mentioned you were a psychiatrist.
17722,Raj,It’s true. I’ve seen him at the beach he’s like a human chicken wing.
17723,Sheldon,Oh fine I won’t shut my heart to the love of Jennifer Lawrence.
17724,Sheldon,I sincerely hope so.
17725,Leonard,Then yeah.
17726,Leonard,Really? Define it.
17727,Penny,Are you kidding me?
17728,Sheldon,Yeah really? I’ve seen strange men traipsing in and out of here for years but when I do it it’s weird?
17729,Howard,Thankyou. And once again my baloney likes girls. Wait-wait. You don’t want to put a bit of that in your mouth without trying my homemade chantilly cream. Yeah okay that time I heard it.
17730,Penny,Uh no. I can keep going.
17731,Sheldon,That must have hurt watching me look for other women without ever even considering you. Please understand that I think of you as more of a nanny.
17732,Penny,Why is Leonard okay.
17733,Howard,We’re not kicking him out. Stuart and I have become good friends.
17734,Penny,Leonard we can’t protect him forever.
17735,Leonard,All right I think we got them all. Let’s divide up the loot.
17736,Sheldon,All right fine. If we’re not going to give it a name can we at least give it a secret code designation?
17737,Leonard,I love you.
17738,Raj,It was an accident. The doctor left the folder out on her desk. It’s not my fault I opened it and looked.
17739,Sheldon,Wherever the music takes me kitten. I play bongos walking down the stairs.  Oh! Oh! Never play bongos walking down the stairs.
17740,Penny,I know I went a little overboard. We can always dial it back.
17741,Raj,What?
17742,Penny,You know what? Let’s get out of here.
17743,Leonard,I can’t hear you I’m in the shower.
17744,Sheldon,Oh boy if there is one thing that gets my goat it’s those dad-gum insurance companies.
17745,Penny,Really? Never?
17746,Raj,How hard did she stomp?
17747,Leonard,You’re going to need more than 11 hours.
17748,Penny,Fine. You think you know so much. Who’s my favourite Spice Girl?
17749,Leonard,I thought you said candles were dangerous.
17750,Penny,So how was paintball did you have fun?
17751,Raj,Stupid Aquaman.
17752,Sheldon,Well you’ve lived with your significant other for some time. I would like this experiment to go well. Are there any insights you can share?
17753,Howard,Yeah I I I saw that article you’re talking about. Uh the participants ask each other a series of questions designed to promote intimacy.
17754,Raj,You can do both like Michael Jackson’s Billie Jean. While you’re dancing you’re thinking like darn it whose baby is it?
17755,Sheldon,I should hope so. When she called me an insensitive jerk I’d like to think she meant it.
17756,Sheldon,Yes?
17757,Leonard,What do you think?
17758,Raj,What? He beat out George Clooney and that’s something. Like I love me some Clooney.
17759,Penny,Thank you. How about a hug?
17760,Sheldon,All those people blowing their noses. You can’t tell the sick from the sad. Mm. I’ll be at home celebrating Star Wars Day as planned.
17761,Penny,I call everyone sweetie.
17762,Leonard,Why wouldn’t Penny want her friends to meet me?
17763,Howard,Not Tso the chicken so the question. So?
17764,Raj,It was in the limo. They sent a limo. I have a limo. I just love saying limo. Here sip on this while you’re getting ready.
17765,Raj,How else am I supposed to talk to the Human Resources lady?
17766,Leonard,He’s not saying it’s a magic ring. You’re not are you?
17768,Raj,I can’t do that to Leonard. This is some powerful panty-dropping stuff.
17769,Sheldon,Well I have to void my bladder. It was nice spending this time with you.
17770,Raj,Okay. I posted it.
17771,Sheldon,Oh I’m sorry. Well if it helps you feel any better you’re doing very well so far. Next question are you fertile?
17772,Sheldon,I have a question about Batman. Batman is a man who dresses up like a bat. Man-bat is a part man part bat hybrid. Now if Man-Bat dressed up as a man to fight crime would he be Man-Batman?
17773,Leonard,Fancy sounds like a compliment.
17774,Leonard,Well what are you gonna do?
17775,Leonard,Okay alright let’s assume your hypothesis. We went to dinner we talked we laughed we kissed where could I have possibly gone wrong.
17776,Howard,Fantastic Four Daredevil Invincible Iron Man Happy Hogan Curt Connors…
17777,Raj,I think she’s smoking hot.
17778,Leonard,Yeah?
17779,Sheldon,And how are you doing this fine evening?
17780,Leonard,Last one holding the ring decides its fate. I know it sounds silly.
17781,Penny,That is correct.
17782,Leonard,The most basic sense that any space-faring civilization would have to possess is touch.
17783,Sheldon,I just vomited on a lot of clowns.
17784,Raj,Well thank you for peeing in my slippers.
17785,Penny,How’s Howard holding up?
17786,Sheldon,Well apparently I was wrong. Congratulations.
17787,Leonard,So you think it’s okay?
17788,Penny,All right. Let me give you a little girlfriend 101. Usually the first move out of the gate is you withhold sex but that will work better after Sheldon hits puberty. So I’d say give him the silent treatment.
17789,Sheldon,You’re right. Without realizing it I’ve allowed that woman to alter my personality.
17790,Sheldon,Did Leonard? I’m no expert but I believe what we just heard from Penny was sarcasm.  Oh good. I’m eight for 26 this month.
17791,Leonard,What is happening?
17792,Sheldon,You go dancing every Wednesday.
17793,Leonard,That is not fair. I complain about what a burden it is at least once a month.
17794,Sheldon,Wrong. Obesity.
17795,Penny,All right come on be serious. Look you guys have been going out a long time. She would clearly like to have a physical relationship with you so what are you doing?
17796,Sheldon,I knew you’d understand Armadillo Isaac Newton.
17797,Leonard,What happened to your scrambled egg research?
17798,Howard,You don’t know me very well but each time you crawl out a bathroom window to escape my company it chips away at my masculinity.
17799,Howard,I was so smooth on that date.
17801,Leonard,Oh great.
17802,Leonard,Is it still weird ’cause I proposed?
17803,Penny,Yeah but this was supposed to be my break okay? People were gonna see me in this show and it was gonna lead to bigger things. More auditions more parts. Now none of that’s gonna happen.
17804,Sheldon,Answer the phone Leonard.
17805,Penny,Of course. You can stay in Leonard’s room and we’ll stay at my place.
17806,Penny,Ow! Ow!
17807,Raj,Hey it was match point.
17808,Leonard,Hang hang on. So I have to bring Penny you can’t afford it Howard’s gonna get in trouble and this guy gets to have a great time.
17809,Sheldon,Penny I’d rather not talk about it.
17810,Leonard,I’ll just let my hips do the talkin’.
17811,Sheldon,You might want to speak in a lower register.
17812,Sheldon,That’s it? How common. That’s the chicken fingers on the menu of space.
17813,Sheldon,Well then what if I told you that I added your name to the cable bill?
17814,Penny,What’s this?
17815,Leonard,I came in here you guys were all sleeping. The ring was on the floor. No one was touching it.
17816,Howard,She knows you. She’s tense. We all are. Buy a basket!
17817,Sheldon,Fine if you don’t want to proceed then you forfeit the bet and I’ll take possession of your Fantastic Four.
17818,Raj,Smooth.
17819,Penny,well my new bed got delivered if you come over and put it together you can stay at my place.
17820,Penny,Then I don’t know.
17821,Sheldon,Hmm. Do you like Raisinets?
17822,Leonard,Like what? We can’t get fifteen year-old girls drunk.  
17823,Howard,Hold on. Yeah that’s funny.
17824,Penny,Well now I miss him even more.
17825,Leonard,No the pants that Stephanie got me.
17826,Sheldon,No. No if we both like it I’ll spend the rest of my life opening the freezer and going aw no strawberry.
17827,Sheldon,What about his dog?
17828,Howard,He’s probably right.
17829,Penny,You were acting?
17830,Sheldon,I’ve done no stupid things.
17831,Sheldon,Turn to you for wisdom? Clearly that cookie is mocking you. You’d never hear that kind of sass from a Nutter Butter.
17832,Sheldon,That is an antisocial implication.
17833,Sheldon,All right. That’s it. We are now no longer companions boon or otherwise. We are now merely acquaintances. To amend the words of Toy Story you have not got a friend in me.
17834,Sheldon,I’m a real collector. How rare is it?
17835,Penny,How could he ruin the game?
17836,Sheldon,Thank you for understanding.
17837,Sheldon,Okay? It’s magnificent.
17838,Raj,He is so cool. Hey no hard feelings but I’m throwing my hypothetical bra at him.
17839,Howard,Okay the NASA Web site says Howard’s final descent has begun.
17840,Howard,And play.
17841,Raj,Sheldon stop being a baby and let Emily take a look at you.
17842,Leonard,Well why do we go home alone every night we’re still smart.
17843,Raj,Oh. Hey high five.
17844,Penny,You did not just quote an Nsync song.
17845,Penny,Come on they’re doing everything for you because you’re leading them on.
17846,Penny,Okay what about your friend Amy?
17847,Leonard,Well uh no I… the… no.
17848,Leonard,What’s going on with you?
17849,Sheldon,I believe it was your turn in the game.
17850,Leonard,Why don’t you just break up with her?
17851,Penny,Nice. You know you should totally get BernadetteMaryAnnRostenkowskiWolowitz.com before someone snaps it up.
17852,Leonard,That’s true.
17853,Sheldon,You know that doesn’t work for me let’s stay with Mrs. Cooper.
17854,Penny,Article 8 subsection B Leonard will restrict videogaming in underpants to hours Penny is not home. This includes boxers briefs thongs G-strings or anything else that calls attention to his pasty little thighs.
17855,Sheldon, Penny.
17856,Raj,Over half a million dollars.
17857,Penny,Glass of wine?
17858,Sheldon,I brought Amy here to show her some of the work I’m doing.
17859,Sheldon,Yes but they have DVD burners over here. Leonard needs a DVD burner.
17860,Sheldon,Yeah Milk Duds with their self-deprecating name and remarkably mild flavour are the most apologetic of the boxed candies.
17861,Sheldon,I have a craving for white asparagus that apparently is destined to go unsatisfied.
17862,Penny,Is everything okay?
17863,Leonard,What do you think?
17864,Leonard,I’m sorry. I just never think of you having feelings like that.
17865,Sheldon,Acting lessons. Interesting. It might help if I could act as though I care about my students and whether or not they learn.
17866,Howard,You guys are really being calm about Penny and Sheldon doing this thing. If it were me I’d I’d be a little nervous.
17867,Sheldon,Oh please the Hulk would never get across the border with that temper.
17868,Sheldon,We’re not. This time you’re the smart kid doing all the work while the even smarter kids sit back and watch.
17869,Sheldon,You have to sign this.
17870,Penny,What’s the matter?
17871,Leonard,There wasn’t ever going to be a winner. There was going to be a selfish petty person with a ring and three people who used to be his friend. Is that really what you guys want? ‘Cause if it is fine I don’t want anything to do with you. And I don’t know what happened in that bathroom but I am not cleaning it up!  My precious.
17872,Howard,Maybe. I I don’t know.It’s late I should I should go. Look I do get what you’re saying. Instead of desperately clinging to any woman who will go out with me I need to work on my fear of being alone.
17873,Sheldon,It’s right here on the bottom.
17874,Penny,Okay that’s just the plot for Dirty Dancing. What else would you love? Other than being lifted over Patrick Swayze’s head.
17875,Leonard,Those things can still happen.
17876,Sheldon,All right. Last night you gave me some excellent advice regarding my problem here at home you kissed me and then vomited on and off for 40 minutes following which you passed out on your bathroom floor. I then folded a towel under your head as a pillow set your oven clock to the correct time because it was driving me crazy and I left.
17877,Leonard,What was your question again?
17878,Penny,Yeah. Leonard gave me an emergency key.
17879,Raj,And he’s all like aren’t you the guys from Footprints on the Moo-oo-ooh what is he doing?!
17880,Howard,Oh my goodness look at this room! Champagne! Roses! Oh and little chocolates! This is going to be the best Valentine’s Day ever.
17881,Sheldon,That’s right. So stay on my good side or I’ll get you a little something too.
17882,Leonard,I can’t believe you bought a red cowboy hat.
17883,Penny,Really? What is the craziest thing you’ve ever done with a woman? And the time you and I had sex in the ocean does not count.
17884,Leonard,Sheldon you can still go on the trip in a few weeks. Just help us out.
17885,Penny,Wet wall?
17886,Sheldon,Kind of like when Firefly was cancelled. But not as big.
17887,Howard,They’re just having a little trouble communicating. My dad says it’s because the sound of my mom’s voice makes him want to tear his ears off and sew them over his eyes so he never has to look at her again.
17888,Sheldon,I’m back.
17889,Sheldon,Or what if we fold them?
17890,Penny,I would.
17891,Leonard,Had to wake him up from his nap didn’t you?
17892,Penny,You know just-just one thing. Look we’re in a really great place right now and I don’t want to do anything that will make stuff all weird again.
17893,Sheldon,Qu’vatlh 
17894,Sheldon,Not yet. How will I learn if I’m comfortable living with Amy or just comfortable because I’m in my own apartment? Now if this experiment is going to be valid I suggest a neutral environment.
17895,Sheldon,If you let me use negative reinforcement I can get it done before we go to bed.
17896,Leonard,Thanks. It’s really hard to find these in his size. So listen. I’ve been meaning to talk to you about the other morning.
17897,Raj,Come on you know I can’t talk to women unless I’m lit up like the Hindu festival of Diwali.
17899,Penny,Wow excuse me.
17900,Sheldon,I’m back.
17901,Leonard,For God’s sake will you stop with the Schrodinger stuff.
17902,Sheldon,Yeah herbal tea for me please.
17903,Howard,Good good. ‘Cause no matter how hard I try I cannot get the twins to look alike.
17904,Penny,Sleepy ki…
17905,Leonard,Okay. Uh I’ll I’ll come get you. What’s the address?
17906,Sheldon,Just one example of how birthdays can be terrible. Now can we please drop this subject and pick a new one? I suggest how thick can a soup get before it becomes a stew? You know the answer it may surprise you.
17907,Penny,Oh no no no crystals don’t work.
17908,Raj,If she did it would be amazing. That woman can do no wrong.
17909,Raj,This is the worst. If we’re gonna get shot down we might as well just go to a bar and do it old school.
17910,Leonard,Told ya.
17911,Sheldon,Baffling right? We were necking like a couple of hooligans under the school bleachers. I stopped so I could ask the question. Next thing I know good-bye kissy face. Hello yelly face.
17912,Penny,Hey guys I got this.
17913,Sheldon,You know surprisingly uh the letter from your father wasn’t the most interesting thing I read in the closet. Bernadette’s diary has some saucy passages.
17914,Sheldon,What about the won-tons?
17915,Penny,Thanks but I don’t like glitter on my scrambled eggs.
17916,Sheldon,What happened?
17917,Penny,Leonard don’t you get it? If you guys keep going along with his insanity you’re just encouraging him.
17918,Raj,Someone should really close that loading door.
17919,Raj,I was homesick.
17920,Penny,Okay here’s the deal you either help me throw Leonard a birthday party or so help me God I will go into your bedroom and I will unbag all of your most valuable mint condition comic books. And on one of them you won’t know which I’ll draw a tiny happy face in ink.
17921,Sheldon,It’s been pointed out by my girlfriend that I may have been annoying to you.
17922,Howard,Since you two are gonna be around for Valentine’s would you mind watching Cinnamon?
17923,Penny,Yes.
17924,Raj,He brought you a pretty rock.
17925,Sheldon,I just wanted to let you know that you can remove Amy from your nightly prayers. Unless you’re open to praying for a beehive to fall on her head.
17926,Sheldon,If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability what would it be?
17927,Sheldon,Thank God.
17928,Penny,Oh sure I am.
17929,Penny,Which is?
17930,Leonard,Oh. We should get going.
17931,Sheldon,I love you too.
17932,Raj,Yeah. I’m getting all my exes together in order to discuss why they broke up with me and how I can be a better boyfriend.
17933,Leonard,Howard you can’t hold me to that.
17934,Leonard,Yeah hi hi. How’s it going?
17935,Raj,I’m so happy you asked me here and I hope we can hang out again sometime. You know as friends lovemaking partners whatever.
17936,Leonard,Penny says they’re having fun working on the prototype.
17937,Howard,How did you get here?
17938,Raj,Well unlike that my games are much more fun.
17939,Leonard,I’m not in the mood Sheldon.
17940,Leonard,No you are now nothing. You have no connection to this project whatsoever.
17941,Penny,Hi how was the screening?
17942,Sheldon,This is my moment dag nab it!
17943,Penny,Where are you going?
17944,Penny,Ugh fine. But the man really needs to work on his girl issues.
17945,Penny,Hey if you’re still looking to make money I will pay you to burn that jacket.
17946,Leonard,Okay then. You know you can grow the ingredients for soup. .
17947,Penny,Yeah?
17948,Sheldon,All right.
17949,Leonard,Want to catch me up?
17950,Raj,Oh good.
17951,Sheldon,Yes.
17952,Sheldon,Sarcasm?
17953,Penny,Yeah yeah we should go out.
17954,Sheldon,I realize that but safety concerns went out the window two apple juices ago.
17955,Leonard,Whatever Sheldon. I’m exhausted. I’m not taking you to the dentist.
17956,Leonard,Congratulations on the MacArthur Grant by the way. Big fan.
17957,Leonard,I didn’t do anything he’s just gone insane.
17958,Leonard,How can you not be sure?
17961,Raj,Yeah i heard you on the baby monitor. Didn’t think you could think you could turn the theme from Walking Dead into a lullaby.
17963,Howard,Howard Howard look at the DVD screen. I put on Batman The Animated Series. Your favourite.
17964,Penny,What?
17965,Sheldon,I’m sorry but these are just ordinary foods with the names bent into tortured puns. The dishes themselves are in no way Halloweenie.
17966,Raj,Nothing. I was just calling to check in make sure she’s doing okay.
17967,Leonard,It’s actually ho ho ho but you’ll get the hang of it. Thought it’d be fun to make a quest with a holiday theme.
17968,Howard,Yeah it was first come first served.
17969,Leonard,Really?
17970,Raj,The Archies are over here.
17971,Raj,You’ve never snooped around my apartment?
17972,Howard,What about Leslie Winkle.
17973,Sheldon,I don’t come into your house and touch your board.
17974,Sheldon,Five more minutes.
17975,Penny,Aw.
17976,Penny,What?  Oh you got to be kidding me.
17977,Sheldon,Oh I think that’s below the pay grade of an Imperial Officer. Stormtroopers are really the ones who…
17978,Howard,I don’t know. Maybe.
17979,Leonard,Oh yeah? Mummies are wrapped in bandages.
17980,Sheldon,Glad.
17981,Sheldon,Dr. Fowler and I began an experiment in living together after her apartment became water damaged. This is our friend Penny’s place. You may remember her from our episode Flags and the People Who Don’t Understand Them.
17982,Howard,No problem. My treat. I’ll swing by after work.
17983,Sheldon,Penny there’s only one cookie with something in the middle that solves life’s problems and that’s an Oreo. Or a Nutter Butter if you’re in a pinch.
17985,Sheldon, Penny.
17986,Penny,Okay. Leonard will you marry me?
17987,Leonard,What the hell is going on?
17988,Howard,Moo-stache.
17989,Leonard,What else would it be?
17990,Sheldon,I know what this is about. Given the professional standstill you’re at you’re wondering if this is the appropriate time to abandon your research and focus on teaching. Yes. And if I may suggest consider changing disciplines. Yeah to the humanities perhaps history. One of the advantages of teaching history is that you don’t have to create things you know you just have to remember stuff that happened and then parrot it back. You could have fun with that.
17991,Leonard,Are you insane? You’re not going to party with them you’re not even going to get anywhere near that place.
17992,Sheldon,I’m sorry. You’ll be Spock?
17994,Penny,Yeah. Go ahead.
17995,Sheldon,Better than James Bond because he’s tinier.
17996,Leonard,Here you are Mother.
17997,Penny,And hold three two one. Very good. Now let’s try Warrior 2. And hold.
17998,Sheldon,Doctor Cooper.
17999,Sheldon,Oh now they’re so much smarter than dogs. Have you seen them on those little bicycles?
18000,Penny,Awkward silence Sheldon on his phone no touching. Somebody’s having date night.
18001,Sheldon,Oh no bubble baths either. They can increase the risk of a urinary tract infection.
18002,Sheldon,If real dogs gave me buttons I’d like them too. Well I think it’s very nice that you’re helping out our friend.
18004,Penny,Yeah.
18005,Penny,I’m focusing on my job.
18006,Sheldon,Not at all.
18007,Howard,Great then we’ll get married I won’t be able to talk to her and we’ll spend the rest of our lives in total silence.
18008,Penny,Hey Stuart.
18009,Howard,Okay I’m getting some mixed messages here.
18010,Leonard,Really? You’re going to risk getting sleepy in the middle of your thermodynamic fluctuations seminar? You know what happens when you yawn in public.
18011,Howard,No Stuart picked out those throw pillows all on his own.
18012,Sheldon,Well that’s not surprising. That Baldwin lock on your door uses traditional edge mounted cylinders whereas the key for your Volkswagon uses a centre cylinder system.
18013,Howard,And if anything were to happen to you we will name our first born son Howard. I’m just kidding. We’ll name him Dalib after my grandfather.
18014,Howard,Ooh that is a lot of hair. Ow. And now I’m gonna hear it from Jenny.
18015,Sheldon,For starters they shed and bite.
18016,Howard,Oh.
18017,Howard,Okay that’s a lot of money. The wise thing to do is invest it in something practical. Like a jet ski.
18018,Penny,And since you love the truth so much why don’t you tell Amy you don’t want to live with her instead of blaming it on me?
18019,Sheldon,Oh neat what’s the occasion?
18020,Sheldon,Forget helium. The real superfluid is the fruit punch in this mug. Reminds me of my daddy’s secret don’t tell mama juice.
18021,Penny,Oh. That’s why you were mumbling Mississippi.
18022,Leonard,Penny come back. I’m sad for real now.
18023,Howard,What?
18024,Penny,It’s no big deal. I’m just a little behind on my bills because they cut back my hours at the restaurant and my car broke down.
18025,Raj,Ah one name. Like uh Cher Madonna Adele. All the women who rock me. My name is Rajesh but you can call me Raj.
18026,Penny,Okay maybe she was flirting with him but who cares? Look I don’t even know where my relationship is with Leonard is right now.
18027,Penny,So how’s everything.
18028,Leonard,Well what are you gonna do?
18029,Leonard,Hey a toast. Thank you all for your support while we worked on our Air Force project. And please know that we could not have done it without you so cheers.
18030,Penny,Oh but what about the party?
18031,Howard,If they ever make a movie version of that book you know who should play Leonard’s mother? Sandra Bullock.
18032,Penny,Then what do we do?
18033,Penny,Yum. Well enjoy your big evening.
18034,Leonard,Yes but only to clean.
18035,Raj,Uh my plans with Priya.
18036,Penny,Okay. Um here’s the thing. So I’ve known for a while now that Leonard has had a little crush on me…
18037,Penny,Saturday nine a.m. Bring cash.
18038,Penny,No.
18039,Howard,When was the last actual exercise you got?
18040,Sheldon,May I suggest that your criticism is based on jealousy.
18041,Sheldon,That’s ridiculous.
18042,Sheldon,Is this it? It was inappropriate to discuss Leonard and Penny’s sex life in front of Leonard and Penny.  Oh good! Now I can eat.
18043,Leonard,But you won’t be living here.
18044,Leonard,Here’s an idea why don’t we just go out for Indian food.
18045,Leonard,Mm-hmm. Great. Hey can I ask you something?
18046,Howard,That’s great.
18048,Penny,Hey.
18049,Howard,If we’re all gonna die why am I eating so much kale?
18050,Sheldon,Hello I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Get ready for a very special episode where we explore the flags of the popular entertainment franchise Star Trek. And to help us I’m pleased to introduce a special guest surprisingly it only took gas money and the promise of free food to get him here Mr. LeVar Burton.
18051,Leonard,Thanks but we’ve got it covered.
18052,Sheldon,Not really.
18053,Sheldon,Thank you. 
18054,Penny,So blow off work go on a weekday.
18055,Sheldon,No!
18056,Howard,That’s a great idea I’m going to get him to sign a Batman as well.
18057,Sheldon,How could you do that?
18058,Leonard,Yeah no I’m trying to fit in not get laughed at.
18059,Howard,Yes that is wonderful. You will no longer be able to accuse me of being spoiled.
18060,Penny,No.
18061,Penny,Nah if I want to see a naked dancing man I just flush the toilet while Leonard’s in the shower.
18062,Sheldon,Well you should think fast because men can sire offspring their entire lives but those eggs you’re toting around have a sell-by date.
18063,Leonard,It is on.
18064,Howard,Hey guys. This is Lalita Gupta Lalita this is Leonard and Sheldon and Howard and Penny. Isn’t it great she isn’t fat any more!
18065,Raj,Yeah nothing’s been changed since he drove it.
18066,Sheldon,No.
18067,Sheldon,Well he is. I’m a wedding planner who can’t find love himself. It’s ironic but the point is we can’t trust you. You’re a sketchy character in a parking garage.
18068,Leonard,Excuse me. Uh bad news. The maître d’ said it’s gonna be at least an hour.
18069,Raj,No way dude!
18070,Leonard,No no no no no it’s it’s important to me that you have the bedroom you want.
18071,Leonard,Oh. Oh okay. Good good. So it’s cool if I cry a little?
18072,Leonard,Why are you reading Pride and Prejudice?
18073,Leonard,Skynet is kinky? I don’t know.
18074,Sheldon,Gentlemen I am one step away from securing a huge guest for my convention.
18075,Penny,Wow this is hard. I’m gonna say Cinnamon.
18076,Leonard,What?
18077,Raj,Well do you support this?
18078,Penny,Yeah for what it’s worth engaged people can look around too. Lot of options out there.
18081,Sheldon,Toys? I do have a model rocket next to my bed.
18082,Sheldon,Wait. How do I know that you’re not manipulating me right now?
18083,Leonard,We didn’t have a tree when I was growing up.
18084,Penny,You ready?
18085,Penny,I take it back. I believe it.
18086,Leonard,Hmm.
18087,Howard,Can I see your stitches?
18088,Penny,But now you’ll be able to make your own milk to eat the cookies with.
18089,Leonard,Why should I do something you’re the one who introduced her to online gaming.
18090,Sheldon,Then why are you attacking us?
18091,Sheldon,I suggest you go through with it.
18092,Leonard,Elegant.
18093,Howard,Wow. You’re going off to work with the military leaving me behind. Now I know how all those army wives feel.
18094,Leonard,Great. Your mom’s not coming right?
18095,Sheldon,As you know Amy and I have been together a long time and a lot of things I never thought possible now seem possible.
18096,Penny,Eh what’s the matter with them is they think they’re so smart they don’t care if they hurt other people’s feelings.
18097,Raj,I was afraid of that.  Go ahead.
18098,Howard,Not that one.
18099,Penny,Fine.
18100,Penny,Why?
18101,Sheldon,Well then you have my permission.
18102,Leonard,Hey. We just wanted to see how your class was going. Where is everybody?
18103,Penny,It’s kind of a funny name though Smoot.
18104,Sheldon,Level three and she thinks she’s rich! What a noob.
18105,Leonard,Yep. I’m really gonna miss you.
18106,Leonard,I’m not answering the phone Sheldon.
18107,Sheldon,Oh good you’re finally home.
18108,Leonard,Okay come on moving on.
18109,Raj,Doesn’t have to be Asian.
18110,Penny,Oh just a big misunderstanding. You know you’d actually like my brother he’s kind of a chemist. Anyway I was thinking I’d have thanksgiving here and you are all invited.
18111,Leonard,Sheldon!
18112,Penny,What?
18113,Sheldon,Is this conversation making you uncomfortable?
18114,Leonard,Ah that’s a good question. Apparently someone was being awfully flirty while not wearing their engagement ring causing another someone to show up here thinking the first someone might be available.
18115,Sheldon,Then it’s not chili. Real chili has no beans in it but you’re from a foreign land so your ignorance is forgiven.
18116,Leonard,Sorry! Pardon me! Oh I’m so sorry! My fault! Check it out. I just got contacts.
18117,Leonard,No.
18118,Howard,No never heard of ’em!
18119,Leonard,When does that start?
18120,Sheldon,Have you ever even seen a picture of Tesla?
18121,Leonard,It’s not your fault.
18122,Raj,You can’t sink. With all that helium in you you’re lucky you don’t float away.
18123,Sheldon,You don’t but the surgeon might hmm? And your carotid artery is just one shaky scalpel away from becoming the dancing fountain at Disneyland.
18124,Raj,So?
18125,Howard,Uh okay let’s see. They’ve got spicy food and there’s a chance you’ll get diarrhoea.
18126,Howard,But we don’t have tattoos. What if someone asks to see our tattoos?
18127,Howard,I don’t understand it. I’m a nice guy I have a great job I’m well-educated come from a good family. Why don’t women want to be with me?
18128,Sheldon,No it’s true I did a series of experiments when I was twelve my father broke his clavicle.
18129,Raj,Okay. Come on in.
18130,Sheldon,All right. Boone North Carolina. Every summer since 1952 Boone has hosted an outdoor amphitheater portrayal of the life and times of its namesake Dan’l Boone. Sounds like something that would attract the wrong crowd. Penny you’re from Nebraska correct?
18131,Sheldon,We do?
18132,Sheldon,Not true. The fight or flight instinct is coded genetically. Instead of fleeing he chose to fight barehanded against a brawny member of the weasel family. Who’s to say that I don’t share that flawed DNA?
18133,Leonard,Yeah but we all want to hear it from you.
18134,Raj,I didn’t pick up on that. That’s a nice touch.
18135,Penny,Hey anybody want a drink?
18136,Penny,Okay I’m not driving him.
18137,Leonard,I want that too. Why are you here?
18138,Raj,Huh. Bill Murray did get it wrong.
18139,Sheldon,Plus I understand you have to be standing next to the vehicle with your card when they arrive.
18140,Sheldon,I’m given to understand his mother grounded him for running away.
18141,Leonard,Where’d you get a beer?
18142,Sheldon,18 parts per million. And he’s still doing it.
18143,Sheldon,What part of an inverse tangent function approaching an asymptote did you not understand?
18144,Penny,We don’t have any kids.
18145,Leonard,Joke all you want but you think about it.
18146,Sheldon,The question is moot. There is no way that Stuart an impoverished peddler of picture books would be at all appealing to Amy Farrah Fowler a noted neurobiologist capable of performing surgery on her own feet with nothing but nitrous oxide from cans of whipped cream as anesthesia.
18147,Howard,You had to be taught not to burn down the forest?
18148,Penny,You okay?
18149,Sheldon,What if it’s banditos shooting at us? What if we get kidnapped? What if we end up in a factory making Bart Simpson piñatas for the rest of our lives?
18150,Leonard,If you’re gonna be a trophy husband for a rich wife you might want to watch your waistline.
18151,Leonard,Let me guess you want it.
18152,Sheldon,Oh dear.
18153,Raj,Yes that is wonderful. You will no longer be able to accuse me of being spoiled.
18154,Sheldon,I’m sorry. Do you have other plans?
18155,Sheldon,A tremendous accomplishment would be if the planetary body he discovered were plummeting toward Earth and he exploded it with his mind.
18156,Penny,Um Stanley Stanley Stanley Tucci?
18157,Howard,Mr. Roper’s dead? You can’t just spring that on a guy.
18158,Sheldon,And I could not have done it without you.
18159,Penny,Thanks.
18160,Leonard,I think it sounds fun.
18162,Leonard,Ah now th-th-there you go. Always made it worse.
18163,Leonard,Okay. I don’t get it you said make an effort here I am making an effort.
18164,Raj,Engaging my olfactory sense helps make it real for me.
18165,Leonard,Can I whistle?
18166,Sheldon,No that’s fine. I’m perfectly comfortable sleeping on a bouncy castle.
18167,Leonard,What happened now?
18168,Penny,Yeah me too.
18169,Penny,Or we could just have a life.
18170,Leonard,What do you mean?
18171,Sheldon,I heard a woman laughing.
18172,Raj,Well if that’s the case is there anything I can do to help?
18173,Howard,What would a toilet look like in Atlantis? How would you flush it? And when you did flush it where would the poop go?
18174,Sheldon,Leonard you have to do something about Penny. She is interfering with my sleep she’s interfering with my work and if I had another significant aspect of my life I’m sure she’d be interfering with that too.
18175,Leonard,It’s Leonard.
18176,Howard,Oh of course not. She was just sniffing around your goods because she was hunting for truffles.
18177,Leonard,Oh clearly I could have.
18179,Sheldon,If there were a list of things that make me more comfortable lists would be on the top of that list. Okay now oh since last we spoke have you acquired any pets?
18180,Raj,You didn’t think I was gonna be in your kitchen this morning yet here I am.
18181,Penny,Okay well anyways I brought you a day-old cheesecake to cheer you up!
18182,Leonard,Hit the… Hey sweetie. Yeah I’m sorry. I’m gonna be working late. I I I miss you too. Okay sure I’ll call you when I get home. Okay bye-bye.
18183,Penny,Well I have a secret I’ve been keeping from you too.
18184,Sheldon,And no woos. Oh not you Dr. Woo. You’re fine. I want you all to know that you have no reason to applaud me. My so-called breakthrough wasn’t the result of my genius. It was nothing more than a boneheaded mistake. So please refrain from praising me for it in the future.
18185,Leonard,Well nothing happened right? It’s over. Until we get married a third time you guys will never have to see each other again.
18186,Penny,Yeah women do like a man that can support himself.
18187,Raj,I’d like to propose a toast to our friend Howard his um his big heart his beautiful soul…
18188,Sheldon,Hello.
18189,Sheldon,What a nice girl.
18190,Leonard,No problem brother. Stay frosty.  We’re still dating right?
18191,Leonard,Yeah. That’s better than what I did say which was fine I’ll eat them with club soda.
18192,Sheldon,Oh preposterous. I have been solely responsible for this university’s six loop quantum gravity calculations I have changed the way we think about Bose-Einstein condensates and I am also the one who got Nutter Butters in the cafeteria vending machine. Maybe you missed that news while you were floating around like a goof in outer space. Now if you’ll excuse me I have work to do.
18193,Sheldon,Call me a romantic. I like to think that your Mark Ruffalo is still out there somewhere.
18194,Leonard,What else you got?
18195,Leonard,Can we please change the subject?
18196,Sheldon,Really don’t care.
18197,Sheldon,It’ll also help improve her initial impression of you.
18198,Sheldon,I hope so it was a snort of derision.
18199,Leonard,Okay when you say seeing Penny what exactly does that mean?
18200,Sheldon,There is nothing to say. Except I’m the bigger man. I’m not kidding. Say it.
18201,Howard,Can I just stay in the garage?
18202,Leonard,Not really. Is that my yearbook?
18203,Raj,There’s also a time to stop eating too many jelly beans. And it’s when you’re ten.
18204,Howard,Oh Daddy you’re so rich and funny.
18205,Sheldon,Gentlemen Star Wars Day is rapidly approaching. We should finalize our plans.
18206,Howard,Uh it’s hard to say. I think we’re good but things like this make me wonder if Emily’s really the right person for me. I mean did you guys ever have doubts about each other?
18207,Penny,Merry Christmas.
18208,Leonard,It’s probably for the best. For a lot of these guys the weekly trip here is the only chance their mom has to go down to the basement and change their sheets.
18209,Howard,I don’t know if I’d say you… oh.
18210,Sheldon,Well they could monitor scientific publications and see if anyone posts such a cogent restatement in the next couple of months. If so the authors are most likely in possession of my stolen laptop.
18211,Penny,Thank you.
18212,Leonard,Gee I don’t know if it’s in the cards sir.
18213,Leonard,Okay help me out. How are you doing this? Do they know about each other?
18214,Penny,Yeah I guess I am making decent money.
18215,Sheldon,Thanks. And I taste good too.
18216,Raj,How could you send her away?
18217,Leonard,Uh-huh. The viewing area’s right over there. Sheldon your girl… date… person… Ramona’s here.
18218,Howard,Eh no he’s not going to eat it is he?
18219,Howard,Oh that is completely below the belt. Sheldon tell my parents that Howard and I are just friends. Sheldon? Howard and I are just friends! Fine. I’ll come home for Sanjay’s wedding.
18220,Leonard,Forget the sword Sheldon help Raj.
18221,Sheldon,Because he’s punishing me for being a quote condescending jerk. You don’t think I’m condescending do you?
18222,Howard,Yup. Bye.
18223,Penny,So whichever rep has the best sales for the quarter gets a trip for two to Hawaii.
18224,Sheldon,Artificial intelligences do not have teen fetishes.
18225,Sheldon,Hello.
18226,Sheldon,You don’t understand. Growing up I idolized Wil Wheaton? Wesley Crusher had an eidetic memory just like me.
18227,Leonard,It’ll be fine let’s just go.
18228,Raj,Anyway Dad’s gonna be here in town so I won’t be able to do Christmas dinner this year.
18229,Sheldon,I see. You’re putting your future bride’s happiness above mine.
18230,Leonard,Maybe but that’s not my problem. She’s not my girlfriend you are.
18231,Penny,So have you written anything I might have seen?
18233,Sheldon,I did.
18234,Leonard,What? Where is this coming from?
18235,Leonard,Suffered in silence?
18236,Howard,I don’t want to do that.
18237,Raj,No I’m not okay. I feel like I’m gonna jump out of my skin.
18238,Raj,I’m so sorry but how can you not like that movie?
18239,Sheldon,Well with as much debt as you have probably not next year either.
18240,Penny,No you don’t.
18241,Penny,What’s going on?
18242,Raj,Hold on hold on.
18243,Leonard,The word is forbade.
18244,Howard,Four.
18245,Sheldon,Hulk agree to second date with puny humans!
18246,Penny,No I meant has he ever been involved with someone who wasn’t a braniac?
18248,Leonard,There. Done.
18249,Howard,I’ll let you know.
18250,Raj,Bruce Banner Reed Richards Sue Storm Stephen Strange Otto Octavius Silver Surfer Peter Parker oh and worst of all J. Jonah Jameson Jr.
18251,Sheldon,Leonard wait. No. I listened to your dumb thing. Leonard come back. Leonard come back. Leonard come back.
18252,Sheldon,The magazine articles suggest that one of the ways to get over a breakup is a new look.
18253,Raj,I will. Hey Bernadette?
18254,Leonard,So waityou’re just gonna give up?
18255,Leonard,Oh he was upset. So Sheldon invited him in for a hot beverage.
18256,Leonard,Oh hi.
18257,Penny,Yes. On purpose.
18258,Sheldon,Well he didn’t actually say anything but when he came back to the apartment he was doing a dance that brought to mind the happy hippos in Fantasia.
18259,Sheldon,You continue to underestimate my abilities madam.
18260,Leonard,Face it you can’t stump me. I am the king of husbands. I know that you don’t like the lingerie that I got you on Valentine’s Day. I know you hate the word moist. I know…
18261,Penny,Oh um okay like five or six. Five.
18262,Howard,Excuse me Bernadette. I have to hear it from him.
18263,Leonard,Hey will you steam my uniform next?
18265,Howard,No. No pretty girls. The point is to talk to regular people and work our way up to pretty girls.
18266,Penny,Well what about me?
18267,Raj,What and that’s not offensive? Where’s the line?
18268,Leonard,Well ’cause I got it at the dirty store.
18270,Penny,What are they getting engaged?
18271,Leonard,I know what he looks like.
18272,Sheldon,Fine. Ooh. Can I use text-to-speech software?
18273,Raj,Dude three-time Sanskriti School for Well-Born Boys badminton champion.
18274,Penny,I’m liking my odds here.
18275,Howard,It’s loosely based on my life.
18276,Penny,So that’s Stephanie huh?
18277,Penny,Oh no what happened?
18278,Penny,Hey how’d it go?
18279,Sheldon, Leonard?
18280,Penny,Smile.
18281,Sheldon,Good because not only has that ship sailed if it hit an iceberg countless men would perish.
18283,Penny,Well we’re in Vegas. I want to go downstairs get a bucket of margaritas dance until I vomit all over a roulette wheel and watch it go everywhere.
18284,Leonard,Okay fine we’ll just play one on one until he gets back.
18285,Sheldon,What happened?
18286,Sheldon,With real puffing smoke?
18288,Sheldon,TV  film D&D Manga Greek Gods Roman Gods Norse Gods…
18289,Sheldon,That is true. She keeps asking how long Amy’s going to be gone.
18290,Leonard,I thought we were going to play Halo tonight.
18291,Sheldon,Hello Amy Farrah Fowler. I’m sorry to inform you that you have been taken in by unsupportable mathematics designed to prey on the gullible and the lonely. Additionally I’m being blackmailed with a hidden dirty sock.
18292,Sheldon,A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime wedge.
18294,Sheldon,You can count on us we’re on it. What the hell do you mean dead end.
18295,Penny,He’s my brother. I didn’t think I needed your permission.
18296,Raj,Not as fun as the night we blew up grapes in the microwave. We really have led full lives.
18297,Sheldon,I’ll be right across the hall. You’ll probably be able to hear it.
18298,Penny,I mean it’s crazy isn’t it? I moved here from Nebraska to be an actress and now I’m sitting in an engineering lab at Caltech helping to build a prototype for a high-tech guidance system.
18299,Penny,What the hell?
18300,Sheldon,Well most of it is being applied to unravelling the secrets of the universe while the rest of it’s wondering why I’m having this conversation with you.
18301,Howard,Yeah but what if the experiment works?
18303,Leonard,Okay now that you’re back on the team let’s get you caught up.
18304,Leonard,All right Pictionary. What are the teams?
18305,Penny,I am not going to apologize. I’ve done nothing wrong. He is completely overreacting.
18306,Sheldon,Time for bed.
18307,Penny,All righty. What’s new?
18308,Sheldon,Using Kolinar to suppress my anger at that last comment.
18309,Leonard,What do we do? Should we call someone?
18310,Penny,Okay.
18311,Sheldon,Yes I was in a taxi but the driver didn’t look at all like the photograph on his license so I leapt out and ran for it.
18312,Leonard,How ridiculous is he?
18313,Sheldon,Round two Leonard Hofstadter Darth Vader Rupert Murdoch.
18314,Sheldon,I’m sorry you had to go through that.
18315,Howard,My sister told me.
18316,Leonard,Just reset the board.
18317,Howard,I’d like to propose a toast to our friend Howard his um his big heart his beautiful soul…
18318,Leonard,Okay well make yourself at home.
18319,Leonard,Fine. I’ll sit here. You take flight and hunt.
18320,Sheldon,Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow…
18321,Penny,Uh-oh. Someone’s got two dates to the nerd prom.
18322,Penny,No not at all.
18323,Sheldon,Please keep this channel clear for emergencies. Thank you.
18324,Raj,Emily Hey.
18325,Sheldon,I can’t shoot now I’m cloaking.
18326,Sheldon,Penny. 
18327,Penny,GO AWAY!
18328,Leonard,You got to admit I am I’m delightful.
18329,Howard,Yes very nice.
18330,Leonard,Sheldon Kripke’s not smarter than you. You just got stuck on a wrong path. Happened to Einstein. He got stuck on the unified field theory for decades.
18331,Sheldon,I wrote a fan letter to you when I was a child in Texas and you sent this autographed picture back to me. Do you remember that?
18332,Sheldon,While a thoughtful gift this comic book in this condition is worth at least a hundred dollars.
18333,Penny,Because love trumps hate.
18334,Penny,Are you fun in any of them?
18335,Leonard,Okay well I’ll take you.
18336,Penny,And you don’t want to make the same mistake with the next woman.
18337,Sheldon,Don’t rush it. We may be dealing with befoulment on a molecular level.
18338,Leonard,Well moving is a big deal. You have to go to the supermarket and get boxes and if they’re not clean then your books smell like melons and it’s just like… Why don’t you just get a roommate and stay here?
18339,Raj,Focused Locust.
18340,Leonard,Uh hey it’s your business. Do whatever you want.
18341,Sheldon,What’s he doing here?
18342,Leonard,Penny wait.
18343,Howard,Me.
18344,Sheldon,We blew up Feynman’s van.
18345,Sheldon,Perhaps he’s emulating Shakespeare’s Henry V who dressed as a commoner and mingled among them to find out how he was being perceived by his subjects. Course if he’d have read any of the thirteen hundred e-mails I’ve sent him on the subject of his administration he could have saved himself the trouble.
18346,Penny,Well there’s a bar in the lobby.
18347,Leonard,No.
18348,Howard,Sure.
18349,Howard,And I was wondering if any of you guys would like to help me do it.
18350,Penny,Yeah come on in.
18351,Leonard,What the hell is that.
18352,Leonard,This? No. No of course not this was just you and me hanging out with a bunch of guys who didn’t show up because of work and a colonoscopy.
18353,Sheldon,You missed Chief Science Officer Chairman of the Board and Head of the Secret Santa Committee.
18354,Penny,Would they really do that?
18355,Sheldon,You okay?
18356,Penny,Okay we went out a little bit a long time ago but we were never like going out.
18357,Leonard,No I didn’t.
18358,Raj,Mmmm by Odin’s beard this is good Chex Mix.
18359,Sheldon,Hummingbirds are the vampires of the flower world.
18360,Howard,You won’t regret it. I’m the most pathetic guy you’ve ever met. And that boys and girls is how it’s done.
18361,Leonard,That’s a lot less big.
18362,Sheldon,She’s not my girlfriend.
18363,Sheldon,Yes. If I ever talk about going out with a girl again roll your eyes at me like I do to you when you say dumb things.
18364,Sheldon,Howard if you’re going to lie to your wife don’t start the sentence with Sheldon misunderstood. That’s a dead giveaway.
18365,Penny,I don’t think you can put a number on how much one person likes another.
18366,Howard,Okay we’ve got the cipher decoded.
18367,Penny,Here you go guys let me get you going with some water. You need menus or you know what you want?
18368,Sheldon,What I’m doing here is trying to determine when I’m going to die.
18369,Sheldon,Why not?
18371,Penny,So what package are you thinking?
18372,Penny,Ouch.
18373,Sheldon,Okay then why is a summons for a traffic violation committed in your car bearing your license plates coming to me?
18374,Leonard,No thanks. I’m good.
18375,Leonard,Something terrible in a former life? I don’t know.
18376,Penny,Okay I don’t know where you’re going with this but tread carefully because it may be the last conversation we ever have.
18377,Sheldon,Oh yeah? Well… you’re a mean person.
18378,Sheldon,About halfway between Bruce Wayne and Scrooge McDuck.
18379,Sheldon,Yours.
18380,Howard,Well lots of scientists believe in God. Okay? Newton uh Faraday uh Pascal all were believers. Even Einstein was famous for attacking quantum theory on the grounds that God does not play dice with the universe.
18381,Sheldon,Okay. I’ll give it a shot. 
18383,Leonard,Well yeah Stuart thrives under pressure that’s why he works in a comic book store.
18384,Raj,I had no idea tortilla chips were such a good fuel source.
18385,Raj,Of course not. Look at her.
18386,Penny,Ah. Well your hair looks very nice.
18387,Sheldon,Yeah I used coconut shavings to do the hair on his feet. If you need to void your bladder before eating I can keep them warm with this beret that I thoroughly laundered and pressed into service as a pancake cosy.
18388,Leonard,By the way if it should ever come up you didn’t join us because you stuffed yourself with a chicken carbonara sub at Quizznos.
18389,Penny,Okay here they come.
18390,Sheldon,I am getting too old for this crud.
18391,Penny,Yeah you guys never use that space up there. Why not get a table?
18392,Penny,Oh stop it. I’ve seen you eat like a million hamburgers.
18393,Penny,Alright thank you and Sheldon.
18394,Leonard,I don’t have a loofah.
18395,Sheldon,To the bar to sterilize my mouth with alcohol. Gang way! Dead man walking!
18396,Sheldon,What are you doing?
18397,Sheldon,Sad.
18398,Leonard,No that’s okay. It was something else keeping me up last night. And again this morning. And I didn’t mind. I was up last night. I was up this morning. I didn’t mind. Those are your clues.
18399,Howard,We’re not kicking him out. Stuart and I have become good friends.
18400,Leonard,I can’t blame you. Tiny Twister was a complete bust.
18401,Raj,Yup. Bye.
18402,Raj,I think it could be romantic. You know my parents met at his place of work.
18403,Raj,Hmm. I’m gonna give you the same advice I yell at the TV when the Bachelor’s handing out roses. Follow your heart.
18404,Penny,Oh I just cannot believe you’re here.
18405,Howard,Maybe we can go up to Napa Valley. They’ve got that wine train.
18406,Leonard,Good I’m glad.
18407,Sheldon,Do you think Penny will come here and take care of us?
18408,Raj,You’re nervous? I’ve been stress-eating for four days. Look at me. I’m wearing my fat pants.
18409,Sheldon,Are you experiencing dehydration headache nausea and shame?
18410,Howard,I’ll see you around.
18411,Penny,Because I don’t feel good flirting with doctors for sales. I mean I know I make a lot of money. But I haven’t been happy for a while.
18412,Penny,You know maybe she’d be more comfortable meeting a girl first.
18413,Howard,Good-bye Emily. That was rough you guys.
18415,Raj,Bees talk to each other by dancing. Whales have their songs.
18416,Penny,Okay thanks.
18417,Sheldon,It was. I asked her if she thought I should watch The Flash.
18418,Penny,Well have you slept with her yet? You dog! Good for you.
18419,Penny,Okay sweetie this started out fun but I’m over it.
18420,Penny,Hey sweetie why don’t you take a break and do something else for a while?
18421,Sheldon,But none of you know what this is like. Being celebrated for something you wish you never did.
18422,Penny,No I was going to but she called in sick. And guess who else called in sick.
18423,Leonard,Hey how go the wedding plans Howard?
18424,Penny,Sisters?
18425,Leonard,Baseball.
18427,Leonard,It’s from Game of Thrones. What do you think?
18428,Penny,Well that’s not good. You being blindly infatuated with me was the rock we were building this relationship on.
18429,Howard,Oh my God. You’re loving this.
18430,Sheldon,Just the hits.  Where it’s dark as a dungeon and it’s damp as the dew.
18431,Howard,Holy crap!  Holy crap!
18432,Raj,Do uh Howard and Bernadette know? Or is it like a possum in the walls kind of thing?
18433,Penny,Uh Sheldon there are two dumplings left. Do you want them?
18434,Raj,Stuart? Are you okay?
18435,Sheldon,And how much profit do you make per Penny Blossom?
18436,Sheldon,Leonard if that Swedish team beats us I will never be able to enjoy anything from their country again. Which is a shame because Swedish meatballs are my favourite toothpick-delivered meatball.
18437,Leonard,Gelatinous Sphere.
18438,Leonard,Sheldon that wasn’t for you.
18439,Sheldon,I’ve been told it’s a good way to move on.
18440,Howard,Oh no no I get a say in it. But I’m sure whoever shows up will be better company than a threesome I’ve been having with Aunt Jemima and Mrs Butterworth.
18441,Sheldon,The sound is cutting out. I can’t read that. The video is failing.
18442,Sheldon,Ba-dum-bump.
18443,Penny,Apples and oranges here Sheldon. I’m telling you that girl is a user iceskating through the life on her looks taking advantage of innocent weak-willed men getting auditions for stupid network shows. It creams my corn.
18444,Sheldon,Wait a minute why am I doing all the giving here? If Leonard’s really my friend why doesn’t he have to support me in my hatred of Leslie Winkle?
18445,Raj,I can’t believe your attitude. I thought you were in favour of gay people getting married.
18446,Sheldon,Fascinating. What’s in it?
18447,Penny,Hey Stuart.
18448,Sheldon,Okay well it was pleasant seeing you other than that business with my testicles. 
18449,Penny,No he blew up the Death Star. Why do I know this?
18450,Leonard,Are you drinking whisky?
18451,Leonard,Penny after all these years I still feel like maybe I don’t deserve you.
18452,Howard,Uh you were in the building you were at the university then you were somewhere on Colorado Boulevard.
18453,Sheldon,Okay my turn. Let me talk to him.
18454,Leonard,Howard relax I’m not interested in your girlfriend.
18455,Sheldon,And there’s your answer.
18456,Sheldon,That’s amazing.
18457,Sheldon,Your hair is different. You changed your hair. I can’t take this. I’m out.
18460,Leonard,I’m in love. Let’s do something else.
18461,Howard,Really? I just made it up. Have you seen Slumdog Millionaire?
18462,Howard,How can I be okay? I come from a broken home.
18463,Penny,Okay good night sweetie.
18464,Sheldon,He’s right. And given that you’re probably still waiting to be picked for a game that was played in fifth grade I’m sure you do suck.
18465,Leonard,That’s not bad Howard “Rocket Man” Wolowitz.
18466,Sheldon,By taking away my only claim to fame? Well if you wanted to make me happy you could have told me a joke. Or shown me a cute video of a koala and an otter becoming unlikely friends.
18467,Sheldon,What do you want Barry?
18468,Sheldon,Well I don’t sell my friendship that cheaply.
18469,Raj,Wait my laptop. 
18470,Leonard,You’re still awake?
18471,Penny,Hey is that one of the new shirts Priya got you?
18472,Leonard,Yes.
18473,Sheldon,Irony’s not really my strong suit. But I have been getting better with sarcasm if you want to give that a try.
18474,Howard,Howard? Howard? It’s me it’s just me.
18475,Raj,Hmm. I’m doing okay and I was very popular at 13.
18476,Raj,It’s like we both had these holes in our lives but now we fill each other’s holes.
18477,Howard,That’s nothing dude. Go check out how hung Florida is.
18478,Sheldon,You and I have a standing TV schedule which is the result of extensive debate and compromise. Any alterations except for breaking news have to be pre-approved at the weekly roommate meeting.
18479,Penny,There we go.
18480,Leonard,You must be burning up.
18481,Sheldon,You invited her to lunch four years ago. Everything about her is on you you make it so!
18482,Leonard,No. No.
18483,Sheldon,It’s not a big deal. We have latex gloves.
18484,Leonard,What are you kidding? You’re a semi-pro.
18485,Sheldon,Scotty was on the original series and we’re Next Generation. So joke’s on you.
18486,Sheldon,Yeah there’s Fisherman’s Wharf and Alcatraz and cable cars. We’re gonna have so much fun.
18487,Penny,No.
18488,Leonard,Never mind. Okay if I watch some TV?
18489,Raj,Well we were being honest. You would leave me out of the conversation with the next guy if you dumped Leonard?
18490,Sheldon,Leonard we should probably have our story straight in case we get caught.
18491,Penny,So what are you thinking for dinner?
18492,Raj,On Caprica night?
18493,Sheldon,Leonard? Have you ever noticed that only my name is on the cable bill?
18494,Leonard,I’m just saying it felt like it may have meant something.
18495,Leonard,What? Uh he’ll be fine the guy’s a trouper come here.
18496,Sheldon,Considering what? How great this place looks?
18497,Sheldon,Archimedes would be so proud.
18498,Leonard,Why would it trouble you? It’s like your third favourite cartoon theme song.
18499,Sheldon,That’s from Avatar World of Warcraft takes place in Azeroth. Goodness gracious how are you allowed to carry a gun? Can you at least refer me to a rogue ex-cop?
18500,Raj,And I really can’t let that happen or the girl who does my eyebrows will think I’ve been cheating on her.
18501,Raj,Okay great you can tell him you hate him. Sign here.
18502,Raj,We’re having a conversation about probing the heinies of superheroes. There are no stupid questions.
18503,Sheldon,Plenty of time for you to meet another geriatric boy toy.
18504,Penny,Fine I’ll go over there tomorrow.
18505,Sheldon,I wasn’t speaking about me. I mean honestly there’s no telling what will set you off. You know introducing myself as your boyfriend. Giving you the opportunity to drive me home. Breaking the ice with your colleagues using ethnic humour the funniest kind of humour.
18506,Penny,Well we’ll be in the woods.
18507,Penny,Wow. That is a lot of whereupons.
18508,Raj,Yeah of course. We have no secrets.
18509,Penny,The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.
18511,Sheldon,Great. You know this is how Anything Can Happen Thursday turns into It Won’t Stop Coming Up Friday.
18512,Penny,You went on a date last night? Are you seeing someone?
18513,Raj,I lied. I love them. I only said that so you’d go out with me.
18514,Raj,I would have included the others but you know exactly what would’ve happened. They would’ve taken over the project and bossed us around.
18515,Sheldon,We locked eyes I ran to my room and we never ever spoke of it.
18516,Sheldon,Doubleazinga! I do! Good luck following that.
18517,Sheldon,Nice try. Now Element Lad’s ability is the power to transmute chemical elements. Helium has an atomic number of two. If you multiply that by the atomic number of N nitrogen you get 14 which is the atomic number of? I’m just funnin’ you silicon. And that is the most common element in the Earth’s surface. So that narrowed it down to the geology lab or the chemistry lab.
18518,Sheldon,Good. I’ll leave you to your night time ablutions. I’ve e-mailed you the morning bathroom schedule. You’ll also find a laminated copy in your welcome packet. It’s on the back of the emergency escape route diagram.
18519,Penny,How can you not be happy? You’re tall thin and famous. Oh my God I’m jealous of Sheldon.
18521,Sheldon,Will you stop it. This is a classroom. This is not American Bandstand.
18522,Penny,Oh Leonard.
18524,Sheldon,I don’t know. I just got back.
18525,Howard,You can’t let this stop you. Almost any scientific advancement can be used for destructive purposes.
18526,Penny,That is so awesome.
18527,Sheldon,Well done Leonard. The true hero doesn’t seek adulation he fights for right and justice simply because it’s his nature.
18528,Sheldon,Hello I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Before we get started I’d like to announce the winner of our design your own flag competition. But I can’t. The only entry was from GameyGamer75 and I know that was a jpeg of your buttocks. Now this week we have a very special episode where we explore the flags of the popular entertainment franchise Star Trek. And to help me I’m pleased to introduce Internet personality former star of Star Trek The Next Generation and the only guy I know lucky enough to be immortalized in one sixteenth scale. Set phasers to fun for my friend Wil Wheaton.
18529,Raj,Only if you’re this jellyfish which periodically reverts to a mass of undifferentiated protoplasm.
18531,Sheldon,Darn. If you weren’t busy I’d ask you to join us.
18532,Raj,Sheldon?
18533,Sheldon,Wha??
18534,Sheldon,Well I’m not using my nipples either. Maybe they should reassign those.
18535,Leonard,You okay?
18536,Leonard,No there’s a difference between being stupid and acting stupid.
18537,Howard,I’ll call 911. What oh no my phone is in my other pants.
18538,Leonard,No no I’m not so great. You’ve got plans doing something you like I’ve got plans doing something I like so it’s good.
18539,Leonard,Yeah let’s see money women technology okay we’re agreed our new friend is going to be Iron Man.
18540,Penny,Are they working on that?
18541,Leonard,Sounds good.
18542,Leonard,Good night.
18543,Sheldon,My phone’s on the desk over there. Take a picture of us together. Make it good enough to go on a mug a mouse pad and a calendar. If you were a dove I’d call you Lovey-Dovey. Oh. Who am I kidding? This isn’t a moment for strict adherence to the literal. You’re just my little Lovey-Dovey aren’t you?
18544,Sheldon,Excuse me. You’re not supposed to be enjoying this.
18545,Sheldon,It’s called ornithophobia. And someday it will be recognized as a true disability and the landlord will be required by law to put a giant net over the building. Which is unfortunate because I have a fear of nets.
18546,Leonard,Sheldon you’re not in charge. It’s my idea. I’m in charge.
18547,Sheldon,What?
18548,Sheldon,Oh dear Lord. No!
18550,Penny,Yeah no I meant plans to find some place to live. Other than with me not that I don’t love having you but it’s… a little crowded.
18551,Sheldon,Of course that’s how you know it’s a good joke. It not only entertains it informs.
18552,Sheldon,A mistake involving Penny? Okay you’ll have to narrow it down.
18553,Penny,Sure.
18554,Sheldon,Penny just to save you from further awkwardness know that I’m perfectly comfortable with the two of us climbing the stairs in silence.
18555,Howard,Screw that! I sat on the floor for seven years. I’m staying right here.
18556,Leonard,Did she think you were choking or… I’m sorry that’s great. Thank you for spending time with her.
18557,Leonard,Put on some headphones.
18558,Leonard,Great idea.
18559,Sheldon,Oh. This entire endeavour seems to have been an exercise in futility. Raj you’re back in. He likes monkeys.
18560,Sheldon,I was going to say sad. I don’t know why I hedged.
18561,Sheldon,So Penny I understand you would like to learn more about flags.
18562,Penny,Oh careful. You’re poking at the whole foundation of The Bachelor.
18563,Leonard,Um here’s the thing.  Penny. Just as Oppenheimer came to regret his contributions to the first atomic bomb so too I regret my participation in what was at the very least an error in judgement. The hallmark of the great human experiment is the willingness to recognise one’s mistakes. Some mistakes such as Madame Curie’s discovery of Radium turned out to have great scientific potential even though she would later die a slow painful death from radiation poisoning. Another example from the field of ebola research….
18564,Leonard,And we’ve been busy with our paper.
18565,Sheldon,Are you suggesting I play dirty?
18566,Howard,Calm down okay? Try not to think about it.
18567,Sheldon,Amy I didn’t want it to come to this but you have left me no choice but to employ the most passionate seductive dance known to man. The flamenco.
18568,Leonard,I’ll give it a shot.
18569,Raj,I don’t know. If I want to watch old people sweat I can just FaceTime my family in India.
18570,Sheldon,Oh please. If I wanted to take up a fad I’d get a tramp stamp.
18571,Penny,When?
18572,Penny,Yeah okay no.
18573,Howard,Baloney okay? You two are as afraid of hurting someone’s feelings as I am.
18574,Sheldon,Mutual indemnification always is. Why don’t you start perusing while I set up my notary stamp.
18575,Howard,Nope. It’s exactly as lousy as advertised. Speaking of friends they have been asking to meet you. I was thinking maybe we could all hang out sometime?
18576,Raj,Thanks.
18577,Raj,You know what? I think it’s a little weird that you remember me saying all these things. Maybe the truth is you’re jealous of all my relationships.
18578,Sheldon,Howard’s disturbing recollections aside I don’t appreciate being forced to do banal committee work.
18579,Howard,Oh yeah. There’s a reason he’s Sir Elton John. They don’t make you a knight for writing Wake Me Up Before You Go Go.
18580,Raj,Unlikely but it could be a dwarf planet.
18581,Leonard,Why? What’s the problem?
18582,Raj,Maybe Howard and Bernadette said I could be here.
18583,Sheldon,Photographic is a misnomer. I have an eidetic memory as I’ve told you many times. Most recently last year during lunch on the afternoon of may seventh. You had turkey and complained it was dry.
18584,Penny,And when? But also where?
18585,Leonard,It’ll shorten the war by five years and save millions of lives.
18586,Sheldon,What? In the Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia? I can’t be the only one that knows that’s halfway.
18587,Leonard,You know what Sheldon is the smartest person I have ever met. And he’s a little broken and he needs me. I guess I need him too.
18588,Sheldon,Our friends are jerks and I’m mad at all of them.
18589,Leonard,Then why are you telling me?
18590,Sheldon,But wouldn’t you prefer to socialise with Tom who is a sexually passive outdoorsman.
18591,Leonard,I guess you’re right. See you later.
18592,Howard,What about me?
18593,Sheldon,Are you suggesting I sleep on the couch.
18594,Penny,Open the door now.
18595,Howard,Why would you leave like that?
18596,Sheldon,Wait wait wait wait wait.  Empty room. If somebody says come in I’m gonna freak out.
18597,Penny,Maybe he just had bread in his pocket.
18598,Penny,Okay I’m just gonna walk away ’cause I don’t want to be here.
18600,Sheldon,I understand the alcohol has stirred up whatever it is that makes girls go wild but I really need to talk to smart Amy now.
18601,Penny,I’m sorry?
18603,Leonard,Penny if you promise not to chew the flesh off our bones while we sleep you can stay.
18604,Sheldon,That’s all right. I can barely hear you over my theremin.  Well that was a little uncalled for.
18605,Penny,You know what? I’m just gonna take the bus to work.
18606,Raj,I’m a big fan of your work.
18608,Leonard,That’s just great.
18609,Penny,Is Leonard coming?
18610,Leonard,No I thought he was with you.
18611,Raj,Excuse me for wanting a little magic in my life.
18612,Leonard,Yeah we’re examining the radiation levels of photomultiplier tubes for a new dark matter detector.
18613,Raj,USA Today calls them exuberant fun for the whole family.
18614,Penny,Ubamy bube cubool.
18615,Raj,Don’t they lay eggs on a rock?
18616,Penny,Oh okay cool. I’m going to take a nap.
18617,Leonard,Anyway Amy thank you for sticking up for me.
18618,Leonard,Well to be fair you ate a lot of it before you gave it to me.
18619,Leonard,Or it’s resolved.
18620,Sheldon,I reject them all.
18621,Leonard,What? Why?
18622,Sheldon,Excuse me Officer Hernandez? Any leads on the person who stole my belongings?
18624,Sheldon, Amy.
18625,Sheldon,All right. Look now this may be the rum talking but as long as the unpinning rate of the vortices is kept within 1.1 and 1.3 the Magnus force issue should be negligible.
18626,Leonard,Oh what the hell.
18627,Penny,Hey if you’re pausing for dramatic effect I’d keep it moving.
18628,Howard,Oh boy! Tator tots and a party invitation? What a great day!
18629,Penny,Oh please. When I first met you you were incapable of touching another human being. Now you’re holding hands you’re going on dates you even made out with her on a train.
18630,Sheldon,Ooh that’s a lot of carbohydrates for a man on the prowl. You know what? You eat it. You’re married it doesn’t matter what you look like.
18631,Penny,Mwah!
18632,Sheldon,If you’re free tomorrow night I’d love to have you join us on a double date.
18633,Raj,Well I’m a slumdog astrophysicist.
18634,Sheldon,Or had a single piece of fruit.
18635,Penny,Yeah.
18636,Sheldon,No.
18637,Howard,Runs from stones means that that big boulder but I couldn’t rhyme anything with boulder.
18638,Leonard,Yes.
18639,Howard,Okay.
18640,Leonard,She’s only been here a day and a half and I’m seriously considering alcoholism as a new career path.
18641,Sheldon,Ladies.
18642,Howard,Oh uh on the off chance that Bernadette doesn’t call back and apologize how do you feel about Mexican food for dinner tonight?
18643,Sheldon,A heart-attack-like event is an event that’s like a heart attack.
18644,Raj,It was our first date there was an awkward silence. What was I supposed to say?
18645,Sheldon,Oh come on. Who hasn’t seen this differential below “here I sit broken hearted?”
18646,Leonard,There goes our shot at him living on the roof.
18647,Sheldon,Well you’re the expert. If the correct way to do it is the wrong way then I yield.
18648,Sheldon,What are you trying to pull Mom? From the top.
18649,Howard,Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!
18650,Penny,All that’s left to do is stare into each other’s eyes for four minutes without talking.
18651,Sheldon,May I say one last thing.
18652,Howard,I think we’re fitting in quite nicely.
18653,Leonard,So why was he at your party?
18654,Leonard,Why not?
18655,Howard,Can I make you breakfast? Admiral Ackbar’s Snack Bar is open for business.
18656,Sheldon,No.
18658,Raj,Good point. And you are?
18659,Leonard,Hey uh buddy I got you a little present.
18660,Sheldon,Neither do I but it’s the social convention.
18661,Leonard,57 58 59 that’s one minute.
18662,Leonard,Hey Howard?
18663,Leonard,Hold on. What happened with you and Lalita?
18664,Raj,I’m not going to punch you.
18665,Sheldon,Of course but before we set up a marketing and distribution infrastructure we should finish optimizing the manufacturing process. To start with she has a terrible problem with moisture-induced glitter clump.
18666,Leonard,Really?
18667,Sheldon,Got it.
18668,Leonard,We do have time. I mean we could drive by and just look at it.
18669,Penny,My God Amy that’s really crappy of you.
18670,Sheldon,So when will you reopen?
18671,Leonard,You’re kidding. That was good for you? ‘Cause I was sweating through my T-shirt.
18672,Sheldon,Why?
18673,Howard,I can’t believe what I’m hearing. This is deeply hurtful.
18674,Sheldon,Ta-da. It’s short for da-da-da-da!
18675,Howard,What about the multiplex here? The seats are terrific.
18676,Penny,A lot of people think I’m fun to be around.
18677,Leonard,Yeah and don’t you forget it.
18678,Raj,Hey.
18680,Sheldon,Now today’s episode of Fun with Flags is not fun but it is important. Flags you gotta know how to hold ’em you gotta know how to fold ’em. Let’s start by identifying the parts of our flag. This edge is the hoist and it’s used to…
18681,Sheldon,Well they’re looking for fans to interview and Wil thought I’d be good for it.
18682,Sheldon,Right then the entire thing’s one big heat sink.
18683,Leonard,I don’t know um if 65 billion solar neutrinos pass through a square centimetre every second given the surface area of this car is about 60000 square centimetres that means 3.9 times ten to the 15th solar neutrinos?
18684,Leonard,Who are you texting?
18685,Sheldon,I’m sorry. Is that a no?
18687,Leonard,Yes?
18688,Sheldon,You’re being too kind Leonard. You ruined him.
18689,Leonard,Well I just don’t think you’re gonna have a good time.
18690,Howard,Go out with me on one date and I promise you you’ll see.
18691,Raj,Oh my goodness.
18692,Howard,Can’t believe it. We’re going to meet Stan Lee! 
18693,Howard,October sixth.
18694,Sheldon,Fine I guess I’m stuck with Raj.
18695,Leonard,No.
18696,Leonard,It’s not you Howard he says he’s moving out.
18697,Leonard,Hey I I know things are a little rough with you and Mom but I’m really glad you’re here.
18698,Sheldon,I’m sorry. But in what universe is Wonder Woman blonde?
18699,Sheldon,Yeah but to be fair he only said the part about him getting sick of you.
18700,Sheldon,Penny a moment. We just had Thai food. In that culture the last morsel is called the krengjai piece and it is reserved for the most important and valued member of the group.
18701,Raj,It’s loosely based on my life.
18702,Sheldon,Oh President Siebert I assume you’d like to respond to one of the suggestions I put in the box by your office.
18703,Raj,Scotty I need more power.
18704,Penny,Yeah I think I’ll pass. But you guys enjoy your extra 21 seconds.
18705,Leonard,Oh well that kind of stinks.
18706,Penny,Yeah yeah bye Leonard.
18707,Penny,Uh yeah I just need to throw in a few last minute things you know makeup underwear clothes.
18708,Leonard,She was mad at him. She was done with him the relationship was broken beyond repair and I walked over there and I fixed it!
18709,Raj,Sorry Mommy Papa but with all due respect I really can’t go through…
18710,Penny,I’m so glad you talked Howard out of having your wedding invitations in Klingon.
18711,Leonard,Oh really?
18712,Sheldon,How much will it hurt?
18713,Sheldon,Bazinga. I don’t care.
18715,Howard,I don’t need your help deciding when we need help!
18716,Sheldon,Read it.
18717,Sheldon,Who are you?
18718,Leonard,You know me I’m a big ol’ bookworm.
18719,Leonard,You’re sure it’s not weird.
18720,Penny,Well kind of. But now I get to act like inflamed heart is only a mild side effect.
18721,Sheldon,All right. Yes. I see a sign. It says Camarillo State Mental Hospital.
18722,Howard,Look at this. Do you think she’s really doing that or is it PhotoShop?
18723,Leonard,Okay. You need to get clear on this right now. I am in charge of this project.
18724,Leonard,Your mother.
18725,Sheldon,Sheldon is not going.
18726,Leonard,I’m sure I’m overreacting.
18727,Penny,Those are Star Trek people.
18728,Leonard,Thank you.
18730,Leonard,Look I’m sorry Raj but the truth is I was with Priya last night.
18731,Penny,Hey guys don’t forget my episode’s on TV tomorrow night.
18732,Sheldon,Amy do something. Amy help. Amy stop that. Amy Penny both of you stop it.
18733,Leonard,What?
18734,Penny,You don’t have to call me ma’am.
18735,Howard,Is there a good anal leakage?
18736,Howard,Answer it.
18737,Raj,India.
18738,Leonard,He’s got what we need and can meet us tonight.
18739,Raj,Uh yeah sorry. She’s just a little shy. The first time we met she was so nervous she climbed out a bathroom window to get away from me.
18740,Sheldon,Wow. I’m feeling the urge to hug you. And one and two all right Gollum we’re good.
18741,Leonard,All right. How about we start with two nights a week I live with Penny?
18742,Leonard,Give me the phone. Hi Penny. It’s Leonard.
18743,Raj,What’s the matter?
18744,Raj,Except on a date with anybody.
18745,Raj,What is your move?
18746,Penny,Okay let me see. Nope nope nope oh he’s cute.
18747,Howard,Oh yeah? I love Ping-Pong.
18748,Penny,Yeah it’s a bitch.
18749,Raj,Yeah.
18750,Sheldon,Penny please I think I’ve evolved beyond my simple rustic upbringing.
18751,Penny,Okay look I happen to like your girlfriend.
18752,Penny,Okay. Do you want to make out slow?
18753,Raj,Oh boy. Breakfast.
18754,Penny,Leonard what did we say about being a gullible weenie?
18755,Penny,Yes. The most beautiful and shockingly expensive of all the flowers.
18756,Sheldon,I am? I was wrong. It IS a fear of heights.
18757,Howard,Well what if it’s one consenting adult and one adult who pretends to consent because he’s afraid of being alone?
18758,Howard,Sure we like fun.
18759,Sheldon,Raiders of the Lost Ark with 21 additional seconds. If I can’t see it no one else can see it.
18760,Leonard,Really that’s the line? Psychics are real but crystals are voodoo?
18761,Leonard,Fine I’ll publish.
18762,Leonard,Unless Superman matches her speed and decelerates.
18763,Raj,Guys fifteen seconds.
18764,Penny,Hey I hear you’re a dermatologist.
18765,Howard,You can’t ignore it. It’s not that postcard that says it’s time to go back to the dentist.
18766,Leonard,So what did you think of your first funeral?
18767,Leonard,Well five is partway between three… Never mind.
18768,Sheldon,I’ve been familiarizing myself with female emotional crises by studying the comic strip Cathy. When she’s upset she says Ach and eats ice cream.
18769,Leonard,How’s that broccoli?
18770,Leonard,So nice of that doctor to just let you use it.
18771,Raj,We need a plan. How about Operation Hammer of the Gods?
18773,Leonard,How did you manage to get on the second floor of the Glendale galleria?
18774,Sheldon,Then it’s got to be Patrick Stewart.
18775,Howard,Thanks a lot.
18776,Penny,Yeah. Sorry sorry. Can I tell you a secret?
18777,Howard,He’s selling the Sword of Azeroth on ebay.
18778,Sheldon,Professor Hawking it’s an honour and a privilege to meet you sir.
18779,Penny,Okay we’re just gonna circle back to when he’s moving out? Okay that’s cool.
18780,Sheldon,That is literally the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.
18781,Raj,We are going to find out.
18782,Sheldon,Yeah I suppose.
18783,Leonard,More wine?
18784,Penny,I just want to make sure you get there safe.
18785,Sheldon,Why would you lie about that?
18786,Sheldon,No. They can’t just cancel a show like Alphas. You know? They have to help the viewers let go. Firefly did a movie to wrap things up. Buffy the Vampire Slayer continued on as a comic book. Heroes gradually lowered the quality season by season till we were grateful it ended.
18788,Penny,You know I believe in ghosts too.
18789,Leonard,A little.
18790,Penny,This is ridiculous. Why am I upset just because he’s off having a good time?
18791,Sheldon,They passed against a nickel defence. They should have run it off-tackle.
18792,Leonard,Yeah I know. That’s not even a math symbol. That’s just Charlie Brown’s hair.
18794,Penny,And you don’t want to make the same mistake with the next woman.
18795,Leonard,Yeah I don’t remember that.
18796,Penny,No!
18797,Penny,No. No no I do. I do. It’s just I mean it’s a really big step.
18798,Leonard,Yeah drive safe.
18799,Sheldon,Where the dangers are double and the pleasures are few. Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines yes it’s dark as a dungeon way down in the mine.
18800,Howard,It’s fantastic. Unbelievable.
18801,Howard,Oh good.
18802,Raj,Hey I got you a little gift.
18803,Sheldon,Do you want the long answer or the short answer?
18804,Leonard,How many times do I have to tell you? I have no interest in this woman.
18805,Sheldon,No. No I brought this on myself by being such an endearing and important part of your life. I’m going to need a ride to the mall.
18806,Howard,I’m a big fan of your work.
18807,Leonard,Five.
18808,Leonard,What do you think? 
18809,Penny,That’s why you’re lucky to have me. Back in Omaha there are two different restaurants I’m not allowed into. Both Chili’s.
18810,Raj,Ah beer. The magic elixir that can turn this poor shy Indian boy into the life of the party. Oh yeah.
18811,Leonard,Pretty much.
18812,Sheldon,Aw Amy that was lovely. You know this is fun. Let’s do more. Someone else say something wonderful about me.
18813,Leonard,Sea bass. I’ll have the sea bass.
18814,Penny,Oh sweetie I’m sorry.
18815,Leonard,Yes you’re using chocolates as positive reinforcement for what you consider correct behaviour.
18816,Raj,On the bright side she didn’t even notice the pill. Why does Emily like this stuff? Do you think there’s something psychologically wrong with her?
18817,Leonard,You’re very welcome.
18818,Leonard,Wow. It sounds to me like you don’t want us to live together.
18819,Leonard,So it it’s just flirting?
18820,Raj,A prostitute yes.
18821,Sheldon,I was such a fan that in 1995 I travelled ten hours by bus to a sci-fi convention in Jackson Mississippi wearing my Star Fleet Academy cadet uniform in order to meet Wil Wheaton and get him to autograph my mint in-package Wesley Crusher action figure.
18822,Leonard,Because I can’t breathe. I snore I get sinus infections.
18823,Raj,Look at us. We’re like the Rockettes.
18824,Penny,Yeah it’s going okay but I do miss this sometimes.
18825,Sheldon,I really did think you looked pretty.
18826,Sheldon,Yeah I feel renewed. I’m ready to deal with any changes that come my way.
18827,Howard,What are you doing?
18828,Penny,Thank you.
18829,Sheldon,Greetings gentlemen. How goes your little project?
18830,Sheldon,Yay Penny.
18831,Leonard,Sorry about your car by the way.
18832,Leonard,Well he didn’t throw up on the baby. That’s a win.
18833,Leonard,I know.
18834,Penny,"The laundry room,*Oh boy."
18835,Raj,You called the right person. I believe I have the perfect romantic evening for you to give Leonard.
18836,Leonard,You’re never going to let that go are you?
18837,Raj,Interesting. I mean it’s not testicles on a cryostat but I like it.
18838,Sheldon,What is this?
18839,Raj,That’s so amazing.
18840,Sheldon,Gentlemen please focus. You’re facing a fire-breathing dragon.
18841,Howard,Actually 2008 NQ sub 17 is a planetary body.
18842,Sheldon,Oh that’s nonsense. I proclaimed my love for you. And the last time I looked into your eyes was when you thought you had conjunctivitis.
18843,Leonard,Any place specific or just the Bozeman Montana Loony Bin?
18844,Howard,Do you want to do this or not?
18845,Leonard,Almost 630.
18846,Raj,It was and I may have made it seem like a bigger deal than I should have.
18847,Penny,Yeah you turned your stereo down with your laptop.
18848,Howard,You see I was at the doctor’s office the folder was right there so I took a peek.
18849,Penny,But Sheldon….
18851,Raj,I can’t talk to her you do it.
18852,Howard,Dude three-time Sanskriti School for Well-Born Boys badminton champion.
18853,Sheldon,Oh that’s ridiculous. A bathroom emergency is self-explanatory.
18854,Sheldon,Now this side offers me proximity to the bathroom but I am closer to the window where perverts can watch me sleep.
18855,Sheldon,I’m sorry. I typed that into the label maker but I just couldn’t press enter. Now down to business. What would it take for you to abandon Leonard and join me in a rival company? Unless of course the mugs are sufficient in which case welcome aboard.
18856,Penny,Okay.
18857,Penny,Don’t worry he’ll come around.
18858,Leonard,Well you have milk in the taters milk in the gravy parmesan crust. Your lactose-intolerant boyfriend will turn into a gas-filled Macy’s Day balloon.
18859,Sheldon,Fine no more drowning talk. I’ll change the subject. Oh. Who do you think would win in a fight you or a shark?
18860,Howard,Hey so listen Claire change of plans…
18861,Leonard,Yes.
18862,Sheldon,I must tell you that seems a little inappropriate. Don’t you agree?
18863,Sheldon,It only got three-and-a-half stars on Yelp.
18864,Leonard,Sheldon relax.
18865,Leonard,What? Why not?
18866,Sheldon,A Texas Special cattle and calf car train set with authentic horn and bell. Thank you Meemaw.
18867,Raj,I’ll take one.
18868,Raj,Well he’s not doing twenty-minute abs because if he were he would have way better abs. Can you hear anything?
18869,Sheldon,He does.
18870,Penny,It was for haemorrhoid cream.
18871,Sheldon,I have a Ziploc bag filled with all my old Ziploc bags.
18872,Penny,So do you do a lot of appearances like this?
18873,Leonard,Really why?
18874,Leonard,Okay so she said she wants to slow things down. It’s like saying “I’m really enjoying this meal I’m going to slow down and savour it.”
18876,Sheldon,Well I’m going to make some warm milk and then turn in. I trust if you two are planning in engaging in amorous activites you’ll keep the decibel level to a minimum.
18877,Leonard,I had no idea it was so heavy. The thing just fell right over on me didn’t it?
18878,Leonard,For the tenth time my mittens were slippery!
18879,Sheldon,You’re right. I’ll take that out.
18880,Leonard,One package Phillips head screws.
18881,Penny,I would’ve invited you but I know you’re not a football fan.
18882,Sheldon,No.
18883,Howard,We are going to find out.
18884,Penny,Well here’s your key.
18885,Sheldon,All I see is a black screen. And my own reflection. I look sad.
18886,Penny,Yeah he came into the restaurant. Sorry the napkin’s dirty. He wiped his mouth with it.
18887,Penny,Leonard I don’t know what to tell you. It was just a hug.
18888,Leonard,Well you did call him a glorified high-school science teacher whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts.
18889,Sheldon,Yes.
18890,Raj,Okay new rule everybody only gets one. Uh next?
18891,Sheldon,I came to ask if you would like to go on a date with me.
18892,Leonard,This is brilliant Sheldon. How are we going to deploy it in Kripke’s office?
18893,Sheldon,Yeah. And if he ever goes berserk I know I can outrun him. Coincidentally that’s also why I chose you as a roommate.
18894,Raj,Hi.
18895,Raj,Oh yeah we hang out all the time.
18896,Howard,Okay Leonard put down the box let’s talk.
18897,Sheldon,Sleep well my friend.
18898,Leonard,I know. I usually never see my ex-girlfriends unless their hard drives crash.
18899,Raj,I still want it on my balcony. I say we move it on a bi-monthly basis.
18900,Leonard,But you won’t be living here.
18901,Penny,Well that’s quite a list you got there.
18902,Penny,All right whatever. How does it work?
18904,Leonard,You’re welcome oh you’re going to step right okay I’ll….
18905,Penny,What? Your… your mother’s coming? When?
18906,Penny,We weren’t lovers. Come on. Everyone knows we didn’t sleep together. We got drunk and fooled around. Why couldn’t you just leave me out of it?
18907,Leonard,Oh God I wish I had.
18908,Leonard,I don’t know. Some sort of placebo effect I guess.
18909,Sheldon,But the mission is for six months.
18910,Leonard,You know what? I’ll just spend the evening alone.
18911,Sheldon,Listen to her Jim.
18912,Sheldon,Oh the humanities!
18913,Sheldon,It’s like you’re twins.
18914,Sheldon,No absolutely not. You can’t afford to hire someone who’ll forbid you from spending your money on foolish expenses. That is a foolish expense and I forbid it.
18915,Sheldon,Yes congratulations. You won fair and square. Uh very impressive sir.
18916,Leonard,And you promise you’re okay with everything from the car?
18917,Leonard,Stay in formation.
18918,Sheldon,Oh yeah well you wouldn’t even be nominated. Dr Gablehauser I have a series of important multi-bit calculations and simulations to run. All she’s doing is reducing irrelevant data and making a mock…
18919,Sheldon,Feel free to retain a lawyer.
18920,Sheldon,Well that’s unacceptable.
18921,Penny,It’s calmed the pants off me a couple of times.
18922,Penny,We’re all out.
18923,Penny,So Femevra’s triphasic design provides balanced hormonal exposure.
18924,Penny,Shh.
18925,Raj,Fine. Um on the count of three. One two…
18926,Howard,You weren’t?
18927,Leonard,No no no. We’re not fighting we’re just having a conversation.
18928,Howard,I know you are. That’s why you just bought me a new iPad. And before you start I am not interested in you arranging a marriage for me.
18929,Raj,No no no the sixth season is great. We go to Paris with Carrie and get our heart broken and then Mr. Big shows up we don’t know if we can trust him again. It’s a wild ride.
18930,Leonard,Morning.
18931,Raj,Mm yeah. Those are both toughies.
18932,Penny,Oh please you’re not that kind of person.
18933,Leonard,I see. Well it seems once again you’re caught between a rock and a crazy place.
18934,Sheldon,Yes. And would you make it diet?
18935,Raj,It’s getting beautiful again.
18936,Raj,But wouldn’t Man-Batman just be a Batman that was bitten by a radioactive man?
18937,Penny,Wow Hawking. Good for you.
18938,Leonard,You want to fire me?
18939,Sheldon,Bueno mi amigo.
18940,Howard,Like what?
18941,Leonard,Stop it.
18942,Sheldon,There are children in a sneaker factory in Indonesia who outearn you.
18943,Raj,Okay maybe we should just end this.
18944,Leonard,Sheldon wake up.
18945,Leonard,Oh it’ll be nice to finally meet her.
18946,Penny,Come on. Look the letter was found in Bernadette’s closet. Doesn’t that count for something?
18947,Penny,Oh God!
18948,Leonard,Hey you guys have been in there for a while. You doing okay?
18949,Penny,Can I tell you a secret?
18950,Penny,All right! 
18951,Sheldon,You’re going to have to call her.
18952,Howard,Not getting to see who wins at pigeon ping-pong comes to mind.
18953,Leonard,Sheldon your food’s getting cold.
18954,Raj,We would have been the angry green belles of the masquerade ball.
18955,Howard,I’m not really a part of this so I’m just gonna dig in.
18956,Sheldon,I don’t guess. As a scientist I reach conclusions based on observation and experimentation although as I’m saying this it occurs to me you may have been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot.
18957,Sheldon,So you brought me in here to inform me that you can’t tell me where you’re going and you can’t tell me who might ask?
18958,Raj,Fine how about this? You’re making me uncomfortable by prolonging this ridiculous fight and I wish you’d stop.
18959,Penny,I don’t know you know cookies pastries…
18960,Sheldon,All right. Nothing about this is fun. No one wants to talk about flags and I haven’t spoken in over ten minutes so enjoy your new show Internet. Dr. Amy Farrah Flower present with.
18961,Penny,That was such a fun night.
18962,Raj,Maybe but I don’t care. That’s the great thing about Nyquil it’s like ten-percent booze. I call it the nighttime sniffling sneezing coughing so you can talk to girls medicine.
18963,Howard,Yeah maybe it’s a good thing if she stops babying you so much.
18964,Howard,So I guess I won’t be seeing you guys for a while.
18965,Sheldon,That’s ridiculous. I am a grown man. I am a professional scientist. And I currently occupy the moral high ground.
18966,Raj,Just fine? Oh dude the fourth Harry Potter movie was just fine.
18967,Sheldon,That’s unacceptable. We’re supposed to be given written notice.
18968,Penny,I know what it means. And yes you love correcting people and putting them down.
18970,Sheldon,Hey if you want me to sleep you’re gonna have to stop talking.
18971,Leonard,What’s wrong?
18972,Raj,What just happened?
18973,Penny,No no. You may be right about me and Leonard.
18974,Raj,I can’t believe Penny’s gonna get to go and I’m not.
18975,Penny,I’m here to support my man just like you.
18976,Sheldon,And can keep a small portion of their heads dry.
18978,Leonard,It would blow up.
18979,Leonard,What’s he on trial for?
18980,Leonard,Yeah. And the one thing that could make it even better is an evening with my special girl.
18981,Leonard,No no no I got it.
18982,Raj,Holy crap are we nerdy.
18983,Howard,Ah beer. The magic elixir that can turn this poor shy Indian boy into the life of the party. Oh yeah.
18984,Sheldon,Yes. It’s the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer.
18985,Sheldon,Not technically. In Hinduism cattle are thought to be like God.
18986,Sheldon,I’m not wearing pyjama bottoms.
18987,Sheldon,I can’t believe Penny hasn’t.
18988,Raj,Yeah right. You’re just jealous because it turns out I’m Penny’s number two choice after Leonard.
18989,Sheldon,Please Leonard he said it’s okay.
18990,Leonard,I am not going to have sex with her.
18991,Penny,Okay hang on what if Thor’s hand is on the hammer? I mean if he’s touching it with his god magic does that mean I could lift it?
18992,Penny,Yeah that’s a no.
18993,Sheldon,Oh oh oh. Was he the one who made you eat your arm hair?
18994,Howard,He took the day off.
18995,Leonard,Uh I’m just gonna tell you the truth.
18996,Penny,Oh that’s great. Have fun.
18997,Penny,Oh my God that’s terrible.
18998,Leonard,We already watched the Season Two DVDs.
18999,Raj,Three times. He begged the Fox network not to cancel Firefly. He begged the TNT network to cancel Babylon 5. And when he got food poisoning at the Rose Bowl Parade he begged a deity he doesn’t believe in to end his life quickly.
19000,Sheldon,And snoring. And that’s probably just a sinus infection but it could be sleep apnoea you might want to see an otolaryngologist. It’s a throat doctor.
19001,Sheldon,I get it.
19002,Leonard,Are you sure? Because you always say no and then you eat half my fries.
19003,Leonard,Hey what’s going on with you?
19004,Howard,No you’re the one who let him in.
19005,Howard,Just for the record when you enter five million three hundred eighteen thousand and eight in a calculator upside-down it spells boobies.
19006,Leonard,Yeah.
19007,Sheldon,She’s sending virtual livestock to random men on the internet. If I have any hope of keeping them together I need data. Specifically I need to know exactly what Leonard did that caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks.
19008,Leonard,If the wedding’s not until tomorrow why don’t you stay with us tonight?
19009,Leonard,Okay I have just one question for you. While I am perfectly happy with the way things are between us you said that you didn’t want to go out with me because I was too smart for you! Well news flash lady David Underhill is ten times smarter than me! You’d have to drive a railroad spike into his brain for me to beat him at checkers! Next to him I’m like one of those sign-language gorillas who knows how to ask for grapes! So my question is what’s up with that?
19010,Howard,Why? So you can make jokes about cutting open my brain?
19011,Raj,You’re a good friend. I owe you one.
19012,Leonard,Yes but you’d be using your superpowers for evil.
19013,Howard,Except I’ll be alone.
19014,Howard,Look let’s be reasonable. We all want to do different things with the ring but your ideas are stupid and I want a jet ski.
19015,Sheldon,How about one night and I let you whistle?
19016,Sheldon,Really Amy? Tobacco and alcohol? Need I remind you not a lot of scientific discoveries were made by people having a good time?
19017,Sheldon,Are you relieved that you and Raj were able to patch things up?
19018,Sheldon,Yes.
19019,Penny,Yeah call it whatever you want I get minimum wage. Yeah anyways I was wondering if you could help me out with something I was….
19020,Sheldon,No of course not. We’re talking very mild electric shocks. No tissue damage whatsoever.
19021,Sheldon,Very well. How do you propose we move forward?
19022,Sheldon,It’s gonna get sucked in. It’s going to get sucked in.
19023,Sheldon,I’ve prepared a number of topics that should appeal to both the advanced and novice conversationalists.
19024,Howard,Howard I’m so sorry your blood pressure was off the charts.
19025,Penny,Now ladies we got a B-minus on this paper. I think if we put our heads together on the next one we could get an A.
19026,Sheldon,Roofing.
19027,Howard,What do you mean who cares? Look at what I pulled off here. The DJ’s on fire there’s a Tardis photo booth in the back room and oh my God the food. Stuart wanted Kraft Draculoni and cheese.
19028,Howard,What are you working on?
19029,Sheldon,Actually it’s the three of us.
19030,Leonard,Sheldon? Your mum made dinner.
19031,Penny,Hang on. Sheldon do you have any emotional attachment to this box?
19032,Penny,No on on getting engaged good for you.
19033,Leonard,I’m sorry I’m not seeing the help.
19034,Penny,Why don’t I pour it in your lap and you can tell me.
19035,Howard,Well I finished reading The Pelican Brief and loved it so much I dived right into The Client. He was a lawyer himself so his novels are accurate as well as entertaining.
19036,Leonard,Let it go Sheldon the murderer was the first mate whether it makes sense to you or not.
19037,Penny,The answer’s in this puzzle box. Let’s see if you can open it.
19038,Sheldon,An entire dinner to talk about your research? Where you going the drive-thru at Jack in the Box?
19039,Leonard,I’m sorry. That I asked.
19040,Leonard,You?
19041,Howard,What else? Sell it on ebay as slightly used.
19042,Howard,I… I don’t believe it this is a terrible betrayal of my trust.
19043,Sheldon,All right I tried. That should be the title of your autobiography. Ooh a second-degree burn.
19044,Sheldon,I can’t do it. I’m not as smart as I think I am. I’m so sorry. This is all my fault.
19045,Penny,Really thank you so much for going and trying you’re uh you’re so terrific. Why don’t you put some clothes on I’ll get my purse and dinner is on me okay?
19046,Penny,I’ve seen her burp you.
19047,Howard,And then they held hands and did a sexy demonic hokey-pokey for us.
19048,Penny,Thank you.
19049,Sheldon,Thank you Jesus! As my mother would say.
19050,Leonard,And you’re starting out with Sheldon Cooper. That’s like getting your first pet and having it be I don’t know what’s a kind of pet that ruins your life?
19051,Sheldon,Amy you should know I was never really interested in seeing other women. And to prove how serious I am about us I’m willing to take our relationship to the next level.
19052,Sheldon,Name one time I’ve ever done that.
19053,Raj,Not Tso the chicken so the question. So?
19054,Howard,She was sleeping with you?
19055,Penny,Uh I’m sorry can we just pause for a minute?
19056,Howard,I am but I’ll miss you guys.
19057,Raj,It’s a beautiful country. You’d love it. May I join you?
19058,Sheldon,Morning.
19059,Howard,Well I think the first thing we should get rid of is that tone.
19060,Sheldon,Perhaps I should explain. While working with Koothrappali we discovered an asteroid and I named it after you.
19061,Leonard,Keep walking.
19062,Sheldon,Now you’re asking me to keep a secret from my best friend colleague and roommate?
19063,Penny,Really? Why not? You’re so smart and I’m so dumb!
19064,Howard,Ah it’s good enough for Facebook.
19065,Sheldon,Darn tootin’ I win.
19066,Sheldon,I want to thank you for taking time to see me.
19067,Raj,From that happy young couple over there with all the tattoos. Beautiful story they’re in rival drug gangs and they’re getting married. Shh no one can know.
19068,Leonard,Does it spin around and do tricks?
19069,Penny,I’m not going to that party Leonard.
19070,Leonard,Something his mother taught him.
19071,Leonard,Sorry. Maybe next year. I’m just kidding. Romance ninja. Let’s have sex. Waugh!
19072,Leonard,So here we are. Back in bed together.
19073,Sheldon,Why?
19074,Howard,I was thinking it might be some sort of interstellar coordinate system maybe an updated version of Hubble’s law. I keep seeing the number 90 repeating. That could be the angle of perturbation of a distant galaxy.
19075,Raj,My name is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali and this is my friend Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
19076,Sheldon,Oh of course. I’ll get that back. Like all my underwear that notebook says Property of Sheldon Cooper.
19077,Leonard,I just don’t understand why he knows more about your life than I do.
19078,Leonard,Penny kissed me.
19079,Leonard,Come on. How can you be sad when you’re going home with all five-foot-six of this?
19080,Raj,Okay now you’re messing with me.
19081,Penny,Well some people just can’t handle that kind of relationship.
19082,Raj,We finally have proof that aliens walk among us.
19083,Sheldon,I’ll teach you. “Soft kitty warm kitty little ball of fur happy kitty sleepy kitty purr purr purr.” Now you.
19084,Howard,Damn there’s always a catch.
19085,Howard,Hey uh if you guys are free tonight I heard about a spa where you soak your feet n a pool full of little fish that eat all the dead skin right off them. I don’t need to tell you in Los Angeles sandal season is year round.
19086,Sheldon,Hmm. It never occurred to me to pick a favourite.
19087,Sheldon,This diagram. I assume you were opening with a joke. It certainly buoyed up this employee’s esprit de corps.
19088,Leonard,Okay if you’re gonna start sniffing people I’m gonna go get a hot pretzel.
19089,Sheldon,It’s me Sheldon Mrs. Wolowitz.
19090,Penny,As you?
19091,Raj,What the hell did I do?
19092,Leonard,Maybe they just want to be friends.
19093,Sheldon,Then no.
19094,Leonard,Oh I don’t know. Maybe because the origin of the universe just got proven the Higgs field just got proven and you’ve been working on string theory for the last 20 years and you’re no closer to proving it than when you started.
19095,Penny,Come in.
19096,Leonard,Please let me be there when you tell her that.
19097,Howard,Just bust a move
19098,Penny,Amazing. Would you like to try some?
19099,Penny,And then what?
19101,Howard,Hey buddy. I’m going to be in people magazine.
19102,Penny,Mm yeah no we wouldn’t.
19103,Leonard,Nothing like that happened all right? The sex was just fine.
19104,Howard,Okay how about this. Even Spock had a date once every seven years.
19105,Raj,Oh okay great. Now I can look like Val Kilmer as Batman instead of Val Kilmer as he looks today.
19106,Howard,Me? No. I just got Vegas baby from Vince Vaughn in Swingers. .
19107,Leonard,Don’t bark at me. I fell too.
19108,Howard,Oh this heat is brutal.
19109,Sheldon,Thank you but your sentiments may be premature.
19110,Penny,Hey guys what do you think?
19111,Penny,Damn you’ve got more makeup than I do. You’ve got better makeup than I do. Yeah I’m borrowing this.
19112,Raj,I’m trapped. My clothes have been in the laundry all day and she hid my keys. I think they might be in her bra because she jingles when she walks. What do I do?
19113,Raj,I am but I’ll miss you guys.
19114,Penny,His feelings needed to be hurt.
19115,Leonard,Have they found a match for you?
19116,Leonard,Really really bad.
19117,Howard,So Siri what’s happening? How are you?
19118,Howard,Hey I just found out I have to be at the telescope lab all weekend. Any chance you and Bernadette could take care of my dog?
19119,Sheldon,Leonard let me look in the box.
19120,Sheldon,I was going to. I planned on giving it to myself on my 300th birthday.
19121,Raj,Guys fifteen seconds.
19122,Howard,So she’s gonna be laid up for at least six weeks.
19123,Leonard,Yeah I guess.
19124,Leonard,Well good. It’s nice to see your mind off Amy.
19125,Penny,Yeah. Yeah that was my plan. All right. Come on. Let’s go.
19126,Leonard,We’d have to go to every Party City in California.
19127,Penny,I thought your phone got stolen.
19128,Raj,So I’d like to try a technique where no one gets steamrolled. When you talk instead of bringing up a new idea respect what was just said by building on it.
19129,Leonard,So you guys want to do something tonight?
19130,Penny,Leonard are you okay?
19131,Penny,We’re going to Disneyland and ride the Matterhorn?
19132,Sheldon,Put down the letters!
19133,Raj,Hey how’s the mommy-to-be?
19134,Penny,Uh six thirty’s great.
19135,Sheldon,Uh I wake up. Uh I enjoy some French toast with butter and syrup. Uh then a wormhole opens and whisks me millions of years into the future where my towering intellect is used to save the last remnants of mankind from a predatory alien race.
19136,Howard,All right hold on. I’m gonna drive like we do in India. Get out of my way you syphilitic dogs.
19137,Leonard,I’m surprised you know that reference.
19138,Sheldon,What’s that?
19139,Raj,Thank you.
19140,Leonard,Excuse me I have to go take some pictures.
19141,Sheldon,Can I think about the spiny anteater?
19142,Leonard,Ten.
19143,Sheldon,Well I was hoping to avoid this. But I might as well get it over with. Thank you Penny. I’ll let you know what happens.
19144,Sheldon,That’s it. The Sheldon Cooper Girlfriend Challenge is officially live.
19145,Sheldon,My father used to say that all the time. That and um who does one have to orally gratify to get a drink around here? But what does that have to do with you working at the university?
19146,Sheldon,A naked man sat on it. Now here’s my concern his diet is rich in fatty deli meats. What test do you have to detect lipid residue?
19147,Penny,Any chance we could plug it into the potato?
19148,Leonard,Awesome!
19149,Penny,Yeah? How did it go? Did she make you crawl into the breaking-up drawer?
19150,Leonard,Listen uh the stuff we were saying before we were just kidding around.
19151,Leonard,Even Doctor Who?
19152,Howard,Come on scissors scissors!
19153,Leonard,Um…
19154,Penny,Okay see that’s even dumber than you wondering if being bitten by a goat would give you the powers of a goat.
19155,Sheldon,Don’t you eventually realize you’re just the same stressed out person in a cute top or a fun skirt?
19156,Leonard,What do you mean?
19157,Penny,Yeah you too.
19158,Penny,Fine. Ricardo and Tondelaya.
19159,Howard,Just because you’re starving doesn’t make you an artist.
19160,Penny,Yes.
19161,Leonard,Good good.
19162,Leonard,Okay we’ve got power to the laser.
19163,Penny,What’s AFK?
19164,Sheldon,I’m sorry. Yes of course.
19165,Sheldon,Come on.
19166,Sheldon,Like hippies.
19167,Sheldon,You don’t know that. I still have plenty of solid leads on this list.
19168,Sheldon,Penny. But I sense that’s no longer an option.
19169,Howard,Oh okay how about this. You can go dressed as a Star Trek science officer exploring a planet similar to Earth in the 1500s.
19170,Sheldon,Uh Barry uh how many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?
19171,Raj,Do him first.
19172,Leonard,We get it. 73 is the Chuck Norris of numbers.
19173,Penny,Aw.
19174,Howard,He is so afraid of his feelings.
19175,Penny,Well I was gonna but I didn’t think it would go past the first date. Then when it did I thought for sure it wouldn’t go past you meeting his mother. Definitely not past the two of you sleeping together. I mean the warning signs were there this is really on you.
19176,Howard,For what making me sound like a Simpsons character?
19177,Penny,Oh Mm. Hey you know how we’ve been taking things slow?
19178,Sheldon,Sick?
19179,Sheldon,I started doing it.
19180,Sheldon,If I say yes can we turn off that Latin orgy music?
19182,Leonard,Well good night. 
19183,Sheldon,I said give it to me.
19184,Sheldon,I’m sorry. Ooh Penny it’s as if the Cheesecake Factory is run by witches.
19185,Leonard,Well we know they were smart enough to send him away.
19186,Penny,No!
19187,Raj,Wait. You’re sure they’re Star Wars tickets?
19188,Howard,I’m really disappointed we’re not gonna have our own comic book store.
19189,Sheldon,Oh yeah. Okay now pull your car into the spot and let’s get out of here.
19191,Sheldon,I called the department secretary to see what happened. Apparently I have a reputation for being obnoxious.
19192,Howard,I uh I suppose I could stay for some dessert.
19193,Sheldon,Leonard I’m at the police station. I was robbed. They took my phone my wallet my iPad everything.
19194,Penny,Those are also the side effects of having a 75-year-old man with an erection climb on top of you.
19195,Leonard,Would you like an autograph?
19196,Penny,‘Cause they both turned their phones off.
19197,Raj,Don’t come to the hospital. We’re headed home.
19198,Penny,Oh.
19199,Raj,Um no.
19200,Leonard,Fine. I want black-tie.
19201,Raj,You’re not wrong about Fruit Stripe. I was always a Hubba Bubba man.
19202,Sheldon,Well the evidence does support that.
19203,Sheldon,Oh I see what’s happening here. You’re playing hard to get.
19204,Penny,Really?
19205,Sheldon,I see man after man leaving this apartment never to return.
19206,Sheldon,I can’t see it! It just won’t coalesce.
19207,Penny,Look at us. Our first Thanksgiving as husband and wife.
19208,Howard,You know there is a way we can get action figures to look exactly like us.
19209,Penny,What now?
19210,Raj,I heard you call her Brown Sugar. In my book that’s defilement.
19211,Sheldon,In fact I have 61 of them. Would you like to see the list?
19212,Raj,You know a man can care deeply about a woman and a pet. It’s not strange.
19213,Leonard,Yes.  My name is Dr Leonard Hofstadter and I could never please my parents so I need to get all my self-esteem from strangers like you. But he’s worse.
19214,Leonard,Yeah at home.
19215,Sheldon, Penny?
19216,Sheldon,Slick huh?
19217,Sheldon,Play. Play. Play. Play. Play.
19218,Penny,Hey Bev guess what?
19219,Sheldon,Amy’s upset? Is it about me?
19220,Penny,Look I said I’m sorry. Can’t u please let it go?
19221,Leonard,Had will have placed?
19222,Leonard,Yeah vaguely.
19223,Sheldon,I’m sorry coffee’s out of the question. When I moved to California I promised my mother that I wouldn’t start doing drugs.
19225,Raj,Let’s just play.
19226,Penny,Is he okay?
19227,Sheldon,Electrons move through graphene act as if they have no mass…
19228,Penny,Five?
19229,Howard,I’m sweating already.
19230,Sheldon,Oh well thank you. Believe it or not I just learned a Chinese research team at the Hubei Institute for Nuclear Physics ran a test on a cyclotron and the results were extremely promising.
19231,Raj,You mean some guy in a lame suit?
19232,Leonard,Sorry palm’s a little sweaty. What’s that word?
19233,Raj,Great. Then she won’t know I’m lying.
19234,Raj,Hey guys. This is Lalita Gupta Lalita this is Leonard and Sheldon and Howard and Penny. Isn’t it great she isn’t fat any more!
19235,Sheldon,Leonard you and I have our ups and downs. But I have always considered you my family. Even before the recent threat of our parents fornicating like wrinkly old rabbits. I don’t always show it but you are of great importance to me. Both of you.
19236,Sheldon,Well I suppose everyone’s entitled to their own opinion. I think I’ll turn in. I didn’t want to teach those poopy heads anyway.
19237,Leonard,Just extending the intimacy. Do you want to slip over to the radiation lab and share a decontamination shower?
19238,Sheldon,Is there too much pepper on your salad?
19239,Leonard,Yeah I uh went for a drink.
19240,Leonard,You’re right. It’s Anything Can Happen Thursday let’s hit the clubs and meet hot women!
19241,Leonard,Hello boys.
19242,Penny,Well I guess I could take it down and put it up when she comes over but it’s kind of heavy.
19243,Leonard,Oh I’d wait.
19244,Sheldon,Listen to what Mr. Wil Wheaton is tweeting. Best seats in house for Raiders screening. Suck on that Sheldon Cooper.
19245,Leonard,Absolutely not. If I’m gonna be stuck at home with the kids while you’re on location cheating on me with Ryan Gosling then Leonard gots to get paid. So you think about us getting married?
19246,Sheldon,You’re just using food to mask the fear that you’re fundamentally unlovable and therefore going to be alone forever.
19247,Raj,Not the brush part just the little rubber thing to pick food from my teeth and massage my gums.
19248,Sheldon,Oh God now even you’re smarter than me.
19249,Penny,Okay everybody Sheldon is gonna come back out but I think he’s a little embarrassed so let’s all be extra nice okay?
19250,Sheldon,Simultaneously a festival of cloying clichés. You sicken me.
19251,Sheldon,I was going to ask you what is the best fruit but then I realized what I want to ask you is why is there a Band-Aid on your forearm but then I realized what I really want to ask you is just can you just go?
19253,Penny,Um no hi Leonard this is Doug Doug this is my neighbour Leonard.
19254,Penny,You’re right I’m sorry. Sounds like fun.
19255,Sheldon,You never saw what jumped out at me at the bus station.
19256,Raj,Wow. Looks like the Ganges on laundry day.
19257,Sheldon,If you find this draft acceptable then I believe your new relationship agreement is ready to be signed.
19258,Leonard,Okay you’re gonna have to make a lot more sense than that.
19259,Raj,How old is this Jell-O?
19260,Leonard,Uh guys we’re locked in here.
19261,Sheldon,Well I don’t care how you did it. I have more important things to think about. Clearly the cards are marked.
19262,Leonard,Oh my God. I’m lying in bed with a beautiful woman who can quote Yoda. I love you Penny.
19263,Raj,Okay cool. Oh and you’re sure your roommate’s not gonna come back while I’m here alone right? ‘Cause that’ll be awkward.
19264,Leonard,This is ridiculous. Are we gonna play cards or not?
19265,Raj,Okay that sounds like us.
19266,Raj,37 minutes left until the deadline.
19267,Sheldon,Good night.  Leonard Leonard Leonard
19268,Sheldon,A Tardis makes no sense. It’s a time machine from a science-fiction show. It has nothing to do with Halloween. That being said if you don’t get a Tardis you stink and your party stinks.
19269,Leonard,Oh oh I have. So bad.
19270,Leonard,So tell him to apologize.
19271,Penny,KMN.
19272,Leonard,I don’t know. Yours looks like he has worms.
19273,Penny,It’s not funny. You’re up. Call your mother.
19274,Leonard,It’s okay. You didn’t know. I’ll take care of it.
19275,Sheldon,I’m thinking about how one could use the fact that a rapidly rotating mirror turns virtual photons into real ones as a method of observing dark energy.
19276,Leonard,Almost.
19277,Leonard,Sorry.
19278,Penny,Ooh one gravy boat.
19279,Penny,Yeah that that is the sexiest dog.
19280,Leonard,Not that you need it. I bet you look great in a swimsuit.
19281,Raj,Wail till I Snapchat that my friends might be working on a top secret government project.
19282,Penny,Yes yes you bruise you peel. It’s like I’m married to an old piece of fruit.
19283,Sheldon,Why?
19284,Leonard,Let’s go.
19285,Leonard,Dammit Sheldon! You said Penny told you a secret what was the secret.
19286,Raj,Yeah. Mrs. Wolowitz was pretty special. When I first moved to America Howard was my only friend and she made me feel so welcome in her home. Which says a lot because those first few years she thought I was the gardener.
19287,Penny,Okay here’s uh twenty-five. Keep the change.
19288,Raj,You’re right. Everyone loves music.
19289,Penny,The… the eighth grade?
19290,Leonard,Sheldon relax she doesn’t have any symptoms I’m sure she’s not contagious.
19291,Leonard,Fun. We know how much you love that.
19292,Howard,I can’t talk to her you do it.
19293,Penny,You’re right.  No.
19294,Raj,Yeah me too.
19295,Leonard,Why? Because they won’t get off your lawn? Is Stuart trying to get a loan or or find investors?
19296,Leonard,I have to buy that stupid collector’s tin.
19297,Sheldon,Even the girls.
19298,Sheldon,It’s not hard one in five. Now you know why I’m pouting.
19299,Raj,Yeah. You know the last couple of weeks have been pretty rough but uh staying here with you guys has really helped take my mind off of it.
19300,Leonard,What’s that supposed to mean?
19301,Penny,Well um I’m just a little thirsty.
19302,Raj,Aren’t you leaving for your booty call?
19303,Leonard,Okay well I guess I should get dressed so I can take everyone to work. You and Sheldon and Sheldon’s friend Dr. Plimpton who you just met. It’ll be fun. Like a clown car.
19304,Penny,I already told you I’m okay with it. I mean if anything I’m quite pleased  that makes him so happy.
19305,Howard,Mmmm by Odin’s beard this is good Chex Mix.
19306,Howard,They have that. It’s called Uber.
19307,Raj,Sheldon do I really sound like that?
19308,Sheldon,That’s what Typhoid Mary said and clearly her friends buckled.
19309,Sheldon,Or what?
19310,Leonard,Oh no no no don’t look in there.
19311,Sheldon,Yeah furthermore earlier this evening she threw a digital sheep at some guy named Mike. Who’s Mike? Why does he get a digital sheep and not you?
19312,Penny,People. Yes.
19313,Penny,We do?
19314,Sheldon,Ah well very well. So does this mean you’ll finally pick a wedding date?
19315,Penny,Hey Kevin. It’s really exciting to talk to you.
19316,Sheldon,Forgive me your highness for I am but a monkey and it is in my nature to climb. I did not mean to gaze upon you as you comb your hair.
19317,Sheldon,What?  Hello?
19318,Howard,Come on in.
19320,Sheldon,People don’t go in my room!
19321,Howard,It’s only $800?
19322,Howard,Sorry boys. Say hi to your mother when she picks you up. Or I could just tell her later tonight! We pwned them dude! Up top!
19323,Leonard,I don’t. I really don’t. Just try it on. Oh yeah.
19324,Sheldon,I was going to make you red zinger but since Mars is the red planet I went with peppermint.
19325,Sheldon,I can’t. Losing on purpose is intellectually dishonest.
19326,Raj,Yeah. This military guy showed up at Howard’s door. He was terrifying.
19327,Sheldon,I believe the Szechuan Palace has been passing off orange chicken as tangerine chicken and I intend to confront them.
19328,Howard,How could you send her away?
19329,Penny,You’re talking to me.
19330,Sheldon,Hey if you want someone to guess chocolate chip cookie you draw a glass of milk next to it.
19331,Howard,Ah look at that. I have a date. I love America again.
19332,Howard,There you go. All cozy wozy. Here let’s see what the doctor says to keep an eye out for. Hmm. Rajesh I was dreading Valentine’s Day. Thank you for spending it with me. Yvette. Cinnamon she-she gave me her phone number. If I’d known it was that easy I would have considered poisoning you months ago. Oh what should I say? Oh I know. I’ll point out her name’s Yvette and that she’s a vet. That’s hysterical. She’ll love it.
19333,Leonard,Sheldon.
19334,Leonard,Okay now my uncles are bald but my Aunt Edna is one of the hairiest women you will ever meet. So… Sweet lady. It always tickles when she hugs me.  What now?
19335,Raj,Oh. I always thought that was some sort of after-Christmas sale. Well then why don’t we just go to the galleria and walk around?
19336,Leonard,So listen do you remember when I said the similarities of the equations of general relativity and hydrodynamics suggest you could find the equivalent of Unruh radiation in a large body of water?
19337,Penny,I never said that.
19338,Penny,OIC.
19339,Raj,Okay big buddy. See you tonight guys. 
19340,Leonard,I’d love to. I’m just about to do yoga with Penny.
19341,Penny,Well we’re your best friends give us one more detail and we promise we’ll leave you alone.
19342,Raj,Well no no. I I didn’t want to mislead you after you asked me out.
19343,Penny,I did. I mean I walked in read for the part then stunk up the place but then I walked right out.
19344,Sheldon,Oh not at all. As I said the entire point of emulating Spock was to rise above human emotion which I’ve spent a lifetime mastering.
19345,Raj,Yes.
19346,Howard,Sheldon?
19347,Leonard,I don’t celebrate my birthday.
19348,Leonard,Well wherever we’re going she’s sending a car to pick me up.
19349,Leonard,Well but what if this was a potential breakthrough for him? What if what if this is the thing that would’ve finally let him open that bottle of champagne?
19350,Howard,Fine. But no more making fun of how I say tings.
19351,Sheldon,Your life? The university is making me do string theory and my girlfriend loves me so much she wants to live with me. And now the place I need to go when I’m sad is damp and smells funny.
19352,Sheldon,Because according to him you’re oversensitive and have a temper.
19353,Howard,Sure whatever.
19354,Sheldon,Are you and Leonard friends with benefits?
19355,Penny,Uh do you mean dinner tonight?
19356,Sheldon,Hold on. Are you saying that you want to invoke Clause 209?
19357,Penny,Yeah sometimes I don’t listen sometimes I just watch your jaw go up and down.
19358,Sheldon,Great. Now you’re going to love the Perlmutter lecture. Look he will be stating that the universe is older than 6000 years but I thought you could stick your fingers in your ears and hum Amazing Grace during those parts.
19359,Sheldon,So to answer your question no it’s not better.
19360,Sheldon,An accident.
19361,Raj,I’m the son of a gynaecologist. I could be helpful.
19362,Raj,You know I thought cleaning out a dead professor’s office was gonna just be boring but then I found his dentures and realized it’s also gross.
19363,Raj,I made a play for her and she shot me down.
19364,Sheldon,All right.
19365,Raj,He almost made it to the top this time.
19366,Howard,I’m curious. In the “How Well Do You Know Sheldon” section what do you put for his favourite amino acid?
19367,Sheldon,Oh but if I do I’ll be a phony a sellout a Hollywood poser.
19368,Penny,There’s something on the windshield.
19369,Raj,One Jewish lasagna two pound cakes that are about eight pounds each and one giant container of matzoh ball soup.
19370,Sheldon,Can we? Stand back while I turn this conversation into a conver-sensation.
19371,Raj,Please hurry.
19372,Leonard,Sorry. I haven’t given her your schedule yet.
19373,Sheldon,No.
19374,Howard,What are you saying that you’re giving up on me? What kind of father gives up on his son?
19375,Howard,Nope pants in the microwave no notebook.
19376,Leonard,That’s not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that I wouldn’t participate. However briefly.
19377,Howard,Hey guys. Sorry I am so late. I was on the phone with my mother.
19378,Penny,All right well I want it in a church.
19379,Leonard,At least they toned him down in the second one.
19380,Penny,PRK?
19381,Penny,This food is amazing.
19382,Howard,Hold on I don’t think she was impressed.
19384,Sheldon,You know uh once I ordered an Uber by accident. I just got in and went somewhere.
19385,Raj,I know but that sounds anti-Semitic. Anyway I was thinking we could have a little film festival tonight. The theme movies that killed their franchises.
19386,Leonard,Yeah.
19387,Raj,Hi yeah. Um I was wondering if you’re free Saturday night all my friends are going to a wine tasting.
19388,Penny,What would you regret?
19389,Sheldon,What’s going on is I was led to believe I was making groundbreaking strides in science when in fact I was being fed false data at the hands of Wolowitz Koothrappali and your furry little boy toy.
19390,Leonard,Sheldon we’ve been on this train 90 seconds and you’ve already said a thousand words. Just tell us where to sit and shut up.
19391,Sheldon,I don’t understand. What other kind of women are there?
19392,Leonard,You guys are unbelievable you play a game to simulate adventure but when there’s real adventure out there in the real world you just wimp out.
19393,Sheldon,Ah because it’s in Long Beach and I don’t drive.
19394,Raj,It’s not creepy. Don’t listen to him. Oh look who’s got the sweetest kisses.
19395,Howard,Magic wand TV remote?
19396,Howard,Raj.
19397,Howard,All I know Mummy is that he’s a single wealthy doctor and now for some reason there’s no money for your little boy.
19398,Leonard,What? I’ve dated plenty of women. There was Joyce Kim Leslie Winkle.
19399,Sheldon,If I may your parents probably don’t consider this meddling while arranged marriages are no longer the norm Indian parents continue to have a greater than average involvement in their children’s lives.
19400,Sheldon,Oh I got that covered. Headset. I won’t hear a word the old geezers are saying.
19401,Raj,So you were wrong.
19402,Leonard,Oh. I guess I was hoping for a different reaction but okay.
19403,Sheldon,You may want to put on slacks.
19404,Sheldon,Oh well now we’ll never win. You always play the drinking game.
19405,Raj,I kind of like chicken fingers.
19406,Sheldon,Do you speak Klingon?
19407,Leonard,What’s this about Sheldon seeing you naked?
19408,Penny,Well wait a second Leonard come on how can you not go? He’s your best friend.
19409,Howard,Unbelievable. You have some nerve showing up here just to schmooze with the tenure committee.
19410,Raj,I can’t believe you made out with Mandy Chao.
19411,Penny,Hi.
19412,Howard,It’s horrible. Why would you push a cow over? They’re sacred.
19413,Leonard,Fun I’ve never been there.
19414,Penny,Aw. When he says things like that I just want to hug him and make everything better.
19415,Leonard,That was odd.
19416,Raj,No no no. Hey you should totally get it. In fact I’ll buy it for you.
19417,Penny,Just say you want to drive.
19418,Raj,He’s probably right.
19420,Raj,Big or small I don’t like rabbits. They always look like they’re about to say something but they never do.
19421,Penny,You guys get started.
19422,Leonard,Okay fine I betrayed Howard.
19423,Leonard,You want one of us to go with you in the ambulance?
19424,Sheldon,Hello.
19425,Sheldon,Yes it’s just that in all the years I’ve known him he’s never had the opportunity to receive my admiration. I was excited to see the look on his face when it finally happened.
19426,Penny,Yes.
19428,Penny,Um sure sisters.  Holy crap on a cracker.
19429,Leonard,You know when I first met Howard he would pull his scrotum out of his shorts and say aw I sat in gum.
19430,Leonard,What kind of a person steals another person’s car in broad daylight?
19431,Penny,Is Leonard around?
19432,Howard,I can’t do that to Leonard. This is some powerful panty-dropping stuff.
19433,Penny,Yeah it was just sitting on the street. I paid a homeless guy ten bucks to help me get it up here.
19434,Penny,No forget it. I take it back. Offer’s off the table.
19435,Howard,I got to tell you we’ve got to stop beating ourselves up like this. Excuse me everybody. Can I have your attention please? We’re all here tonight because we have no one to be with. But that doesn’t make us mutants. The only mutants here are in these comic books. We’ve got to stop defining our self-worth by whether or not we’re in a relationship. You know what I see when I look around? I see a room full of great people. So let’s give ourselves a break. We are a community and as long as we have each other we’re never truly alone.
19436,Sheldon,Ah I’m back you got me for eight minutes.
19437,Penny,All right what’s going on?
19438,Penny,Yes.
19439,Sheldon,I bought you and Bernadette a gravy boat worth eighty-eight dollars. Which places me in your debt and I can’t be in your debt because someday you might ask me to help you move or to kill a man.
19440,Raj,He was a lot more fun when he had no hope.
19441,Howard,Because I’ve got something even better planned.
19442,Howard,Come on.
19443,Sheldon,Indeed. Yeah at one point Raj put on reggae music and his sister took off her shoes. It was like the last days of Caligula.  Oh I have to get this. Umbrella?
19444,Penny,Oh no thanks. I have coffee.
19445,Penny,Thanks. Ah!
19446,Penny,You found it. It’s the sound of a cat being run over by a lawn mower.
19447,Sheldon,You’re absolutely right. Nope.
19448,Penny,Hi there. What’s your name?
19449,Raj,But if I don’t eat my lima beans I can’t have my cookie.
19450,Sheldon,To help you.
19451,Leonard,Oh the reverse psychology thing. I see. That’s very clever.
19452,Penny,Pantsuits suck.
19453,Howard,Hey the future they show in Back to the Future II is only a year away. A lot of the things in that movie haven’t been invented yet.
19454,Leonard,Yeah you’re right. That is the term I’m looking for. You are a dirty double mother suckler.
19455,Sheldon,Captain what are your orders?
19456,Raj,You know what? That may be it. By the way it isn’t like riding a bike. Like I fell off a few times.
19457,Leonard,You have any ideas Raj?
19458,Sheldon,I just gave you my virginity woman. Cool your jets.
19459,Sheldon,Leonard I’ve got terrible news.
19460,Raj,Excuse me but I’m Indian.
19461,Sheldon,I’ll admit that was a concern. But the fact is I’ll need a support team. And the three of you are my first choice.
19462,Leonard,It’s just her facebook page and we’ve only been going out a couple of weeks.
19463,Leonard,Disagree.
19464,Sheldon,We did it. Oh if it’s this much fun to rotate imagine when we fly it.
19465,Sheldon,Is that possible? I used to get those all the time. Even in church.
19466,Penny,So what do you think?
19467,Leonard,More Halloween candy? Didn’t you just buy a bunch of it yesterday?
19468,Raj,Just tell her what I’m really like. And if you think it’ll help that you saw me changing once and my package reminded you of the muscular tail of a jaguar. Use your own words.
19469,Sheldon,Oh I wish I could but I realized I’ve become too emotionally vulnerable so like an operating system I’m restoring my life to the last stable version which was in 2003 the day before I met Leonard.
19470,Sheldon,Uh do you know how I solved the balanced centre combat-area problem? Five words transitional quadrilateral to triangular tessellation.
19471,Sheldon,I called Leonard because I failed. And I didn’t want you to think less of me.
19472,Leonard,She didn’t dump me. It was mutual!
19473,Sheldon,Beverly pointed out that I’m experiencing insecurities in my relationship with Amy in the same way that Leonard and Penny are in their relationship.
19474,Penny,Look you’ve got to meet me halfway here.
19475,Sheldon,We’re not home right now.
19476,Penny,Yeah birthday party first. Pity party later.
19477,Penny,Okay glasses off. Find Waldo.
19478,Leonard,Oh God! Sheldon does not have a cousin Leo.
19479,Sheldon,Then it hits her. How is she going to survive? I mean she has no prospects no marketable skills. And then one day she meets a group of geniuses and their friend Howard.
19481,Sheldon,Play that funky music white boy.
19482,Raj,Yup.
19483,Leonard,Yes.
19484,Raj,Well it almost happened when you called my apple pie crust doughy but the truth is you were right and I was just angry at myself.
19485,Leonard,Thank-you. We’ll be right back.
19486,Sheldon,There are some charts in the back where I kept track of shape colour and consistency.
19487,Sheldon,It’s not always because they die. In one case it’s because they’ve become involved with underground tree people from the dawn of time. Yeah but I won’t say who it is. It’s Brann.
19488,Sheldon,Penny I’m a physicist. I have a working knowledge of the entire universe and everything it contains.
19489,Howard,What?
19490,Raj,How about that!
19491,Sheldon,I hurt myself juggling.
19492,Sheldon,Well.
19493,Penny,Hey Leonard check this out. 
19494,Sheldon,What kind of tea would you like?
19495,Sheldon,Yes. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Is this the Zack Johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour Penny? Sorry to bother you. Hello. I’m looking for a Zack Johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour Penny. Coitus. It means intercourse. And I have a feeling I’m speaking to the right Zack. This is Sheldon Cooper. Fine. Shelly. Yes that does sound like a girl’s name. No it doesn’t bother me. Yes Smelly Shelly does bother me. Let me tell you why I’m calling. I’d like to know if you’d be interested in having sex with Amy Farrah Fowler. Amy Farrah Fowler. Yes that is a girl’s name. Good grief. It’s like trying to talk to a dolphin.
19496,Penny,Oh thank you. You are a lifesaver.
19497,Howard,Me too. Good times.
19498,Leonard,So their plan for saving the Earth from Armageddon is hoping a bunch of scientists can catch a ball?
19499,Sheldon,Won’t that void the warranty?
19500,Sheldon,Get? Hang on. I don’t feel like you’re taking this dilemma seriously.
19501,Howard,Of course.
19503,Leonard,Sure.
19504,Sheldon,What was that?
19505,Raj,A medium-sized asteroid.
19506,Leonard,Okay we should leave in about an hour. You all packed?
19507,Howard,Come on Sheldon you got this.
19508,Penny,Want some coffee liqueur on your ice cream?
19509,Leonard,Oh come on some battles you win some battles you lose.
19510,Sheldon,I came to go over your alibi for last night.
19511,Sheldon,Indeed the roommate agreement. I call your attention to the Friendship Rider in Appendix C Future Commitments. Number 37 in the event one friend is ever invited to visit the Large Hadron Collider now under construction in Switzerland he shall invite the other friend to accompany him.
19512,Leonard,What?
19513,Sheldon,Well the lightbulb in this oven is ridiculously bright.
19514,Raj,You know but but they’re very firm so you’ve got that going for you.
19515,Howard,These here parts?
19516,Leonard,Oh Penny I’m I’m sorry.
19517,Sheldon,I’m sorry I didn’t get that.
19518,Raj,I’d love a personal trainer. I haven’t seen my abs since they opened a Shake Shack on my drive home.
19519,Leonard,And who got him to put things other than gloves in the glove compartment?
19520,Sheldon,Professor Hawking.
19521,Leonard,Admit it you’re a little turned on.
19522,Sheldon,Why waste food. In Texas when a cow goes dry they don’t keep feeding it they just take her out and shoot her between the eyes.
19523,Penny,Oh you know that reminds me I usually go back to Nebraska for thanksgiving but this year they’re calling it off on account of my brother’s trial.
19524,Raj,Well he is much more attractive than Leonard.
19525,Sheldon,So you’re saying Leonard has a girl in there.
19526,Penny,Sheldon has a girlfriend?
19527,Sheldon,Very mature. You’re lucky I’m out of silly string. As I was saying Leonard you’ll never guess who I just found online. Professor Proton.
19528,Sheldon,The horror!
19529,Leonard,Damn it I can’t. I can’t I can’t do this.
19530,Penny,What stop sign?
19531,Sheldon,Do you have telematics in your shoes connected to an iPod?
19532,Howard,Okay. Did we at least rent the car from Enterprise? Get it? Enterprise? Screw you. That’s funny.
19533,Howard,Actually that’s why I’m calling. I um I just I need to let you know that I have a girlfriend.
19534,Howard,But if I don’t eat my lima beans I can’t have my cookie.
19535,Raj,Way to make lemonade. You know from around the corner where fudge is made.
19536,Howard,Good to see you.
19537,Leonard,Come on Sheldon please teach me about football. It’ll be fun.
19538,Leonard,Oh please don’t.
19539,Sheldon,I was not panicked and I am not overly attached to Leonard.
19540,Howard,I got my new bloodthirsty savage warrior who will lay waste to all who stand before him. And I had a sensible salad for lunch so I can eat all the pizza I want.
19541,Leonard,Alright oh wait they use it to in…
19542,Howard,Too bad ’cause she was checking you out before.
19543,Raj,‘Cause I I’m tired of trying to meet someone and I think I’d like you to help me find uh a wife.
19544,Penny,It’s fine.
19545,Howard,So where should we do it?
19546,Raj,I have a surprise for you. Cover your eyes. Open them. It’s a real ruby. It was a little expensive but no one can put a price on love. Although the people at Cartier took a pretty good shot at it.  Oh Mummy Daddy. What a nice surprise.
19547,Penny,You know I can see why Amy’s mad at you.
19548,Raj,I got you a talking Thomas the Tank Engine for Thanksgiving.
19549,Sheldon,Well my little flag-keteers it looks like the last episode of Fun with Flags is at an end. If I could I would run each and every one of you viewers up a flagpole and salute you. And if you touched the ground burn you. I’d like to take a moment to personally thank Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler who you may or may not know is the first woman to co-host a flag or banner-related Internet info-tainment show.
19550,Raj,Face it dude Bernadette treats you the same way your mother used to and that was not a healthy relationship.
19551,Sheldon,Where are you going?
19552,Leonard,Sure.
19553,Sheldon,Interesting. You’re suggesting that we recreate the conditions of the mine to see if we can handle it.
19554,Leonard,Great.
19555,Sheldon,Last night was Wednesday. Wednesday is comic book night. Tonight we’ll be going on Thursday because it’s Anything Can Happen Thursday.
19556,Raj,Me.
19557,Sheldon,And I’m sorry. But that behaviour is beyond the pale and cannot be tolerated. We are no longer friends.
19558,Howard,Oh well you said you didn’t have time to go out for dinner so I thought we could have one right here.
19559,Leonard,Well now you are.
19560,Leonard,I uh ah um I…
19561,Sheldon,This must feel pretty good for you coming back to your alma mater as an astronaut.
19562,Penny,Okay maybe we should change the subject. Um Amy how are your lady parts? Still chilly down there?
19563,Leonard,Thank you. I just feel…
19564,Sheldon,Perhaps there’s hope for you after all.
19565,Penny,Nothing. Not a damn thing.
19566,Penny,Hey wait a minute.
19567,Sheldon,So we get to have a scene with him?
19568,Leonard,Hi.
19569,Sheldon,I know. They probably shouldn’t sell those to children.
19570,Howard,This is gonna be so much more accurate than the steam room at the gym.
19571,Penny,Wait wait not shopping for clothes right? Because look.
19572,Sheldon,I’m Skippy. Skippy Cavanaugh.
19573,Leonard,You know what I’m being ridiculous. But who cares what Penny thinks Lesley is a terrific girl she’s attractive we like each other she’s extremely intelligent.
19574,Sheldon,Priya do you know why this is called a toast?
19575,Raj,Of course.
19576,Leonard,Yes.
19577,Penny,It’s just so weird. Howard Wolowitz is my friend. You know once he tried to stick his tongue down my throat and I broke his nose.
19578,Howard,Oh oh what about that tubby girl in the Sailor Moon costume at Comic-con?
19579,Leonard,Well I told you you don’t it’s mint in box.
19580,Howard,I cannot thank you enough.
19582,Howard,I really thought she would say it.
19583,Raj,That’s what she said.
19584,Raj,And it would be my pleasure to be her num-num.
19585,Penny,What great news?
19586,Howard,All I’ve got is a needler and I’m all out of ammo.
19587,Leonard,No. I mean what are you doing with a theremin?
19588,Leonard,He struck out.
19589,Raj,Not me. Ever since you admitted we had a vibe I’ve been planning our wedding.
19590,Raj,Hey what’s it like sharing a bathroom with Penny? Is there hair everywhere? Does she use your loofah?
19591,Sheldon,What did you do?
19592,Penny,Oh my God you guys need to do something!
19593,Penny,Hey.
19594,Raj,I will see you gentlemen later.
19595,Leonard,Yeah we really ruined his life.
19596,Leonard,It wasn’t bad advice. It just wasn’t particularly helpful.
19597,Leonard,Wait wait wait how is my day-old marriage falling apart becoming about you two?
19598,Sheldon,Oh Leonard is it really necessary to caption the obvious?
19599,Howard,Oh cool it tells you when someone’s reading your profile. Jenny309. I hope that’s not her weight.
19600,Howard,Yeah me neither. It should be about the work. And if I can’t get tenure I’d like to see you or Sheldon get it.
19601,Penny,No it sounded like a compliment.
19602,Howard,I invited you to my murder mystery party.
19603,Raj,Dumped her? What did he use a forklift? Sorry. There’s nothing funny about morbid obesity.
19604,Leonard,Okay her apartment’s on the fourth floor but the elevator’s broken so you’re going to have to  oh you’re just going to be done okay cool thanks. I guess we’ll just bring it up ourselves.
19605,Leonard,All right Amy it’s your turn. We need one more hit. Finish him off.
19606,Leonard,We’re not living together.
19607,Penny,Ancient Greece?
19608,Leonard,We’d be happy to watch Cinnamon.
19609,Leonard,That’s so cool.
19610,Leonard,Hey.
19611,Penny,I thought it was really funny.
19612,Leonard,Okay.
19613,Leonard,Oh if anything I’m trying to get my Sheld-off.
19614,Howard,Hey want to spend some time playing the new Star Wars game this weekend?
19615,Sheldon,Why should I? She knows that I don’t like Christmas and yet every year she forces me to celebrate it. Not only am I going to this foolish dinner against my will at the Christmas tree lot there was mistletoe and she kissed me under it in public. Like we were the stars of a Tijuana sex show.
19616,Leonard,They asked me to come in.
19617,Sheldon,Oh uh never have I ever thrown caught or touched a Frisbee.
19618,Sheldon,Yeah. Okay. Stop ruining Valentine’s Day and order my pizza.
19619,Howard,But you charged me hundreds for this stuff.
19620,Leonard,Yes but I get car sick too so…
19621,Sheldon,Tests. Here. It’s college-ruled. I hope that’s not too intimidating.
19622,Penny,Ah. Danger. Sure sure. Yeah. What’s what’s that?
19623,Sheldon,I can’t. Thank you Professor Hawking. You are a gift to mankind. There should be statues of you everywhere. You know the Lincoln Memorial has a big chair. We could swap you right in.
19624,Leonard,No I think it’s because we’re eloping.
19625,Leonard,I guess. I’m just you know worried about Sheldon.
19626,Sheldon,Penny’s making hair accessories. I’m helping her optimize her manufacturing process. All right break’s over. 
19627,Howard,Hey.
19628,Leonard,No.
19629,Leonard,Right.
19630,Raj,She had mixed feelings. But when I said Emily was cool with it. Emily’s the best. Why can’t you
19631,Leonard,Oh!
19632,Raj,So uh what were you thinking? Combine their names?
19633,Howard,Miss Congeniality 2 Armed and Fabulous. I mean you know a movie’s bad when my homegirl Sandy B can’t save it.
19634,Raj,Poor Roger Abbott.
19635,Penny,Okay we’ve seen plenty.
19636,Leonard,You will not believe what Stephen Hawking just said.
19637,Raj,Okay show of hands. Who’s up for this? 
19638,Howard,Okay so we’ve got um three briskets four meatloafs one lasagna.
19639,Sheldon,I’m curious about the whole social construct. On its face the idea of satisfying ones sexual appetite assuming one is afflicted with such without emotional entanglement that seems eminently practical. What I’ve observed however is Howard Wolowitz crying like a little girl.
19640,Leonard,Aw you picked up on that huh?
19642,Sheldon,Wonderful Longclaw is mine. And how about you keep our avocado plant?
19643,Penny,Well where would you go?
19644,Sheldon,You’re welcome Dr. Hofstadter.
19645,Sheldon,Please you might as well have been two iguana with no dewlap enlargement.
19646,Penny,Yo Raj talk to me. I’m sorry just screwing with you. Hey Howard why haven’t you called Bernadette?
19647,Penny,Okay sweetie I know you think you’re explaining yourself but you’re really not.
19648,Leonard,Just tell me.
19649,Penny,Well you wouldn’t have asked me either.
19650,Leonard,Excuse me.  Okay I’ll be honest with you. I’ve just spent the last two hours imagining various scenarios in my head trying to come up with some clever line to say to you. But then I finally realized you’re a human being; I’m a human being. I could just say to you…
19651,Leonard,My God when he’s on the table and they use the paddles on him.
19652,Sheldon,Very well.
19653,Penny,Would you stop? Look he just moved here from London okay? He doesn’t really know anybody.
19654,Penny,I don’t even know why I care. I don’t care. All right I cared enough to memorize that stupid joke but that’s all I care.
19655,Sheldon,So stipulated.
19656,Sheldon,By playing tic-tac-toe?
19657,Sheldon,Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother’s Day.
19658,Raj,And plus you got a rapid prototyper. That’s an expensive piece of equipment dude.
19659,Sheldon,Leonard I am a published theoretical physicist with two doctorates and an IQ which can’t be accurately measured by normal tests how much scarcer could I be?
19660,Leonard,You know I’ve already got a gorgeous blonde back home at I can’t score with. I think I’ll let you two take this one.
19661,Leonard,I don’t know Howard isn’t really the family fun kind of guy.
19662,Sheldon,You saw through that one did you?
19663,Penny,Thank you. Do you want to be on my team?
19664,Penny,Well maybe. But I’m still glad we did it. I do feel closer to you.
19665,Sheldon,I don’t. Teams are traditionally named after fierce creatures thus intimidating ones opponent.
19666,Penny,No it is. Does he stay? Do they kiss? Does she find out about Montana?
19667,Sheldon,Would you like to play a driving game I invented?
19668,Raj,How can she when you beat around the bush. She’s from the mean streets where they shoot from the hip and keep it real.
19669,Leonard,Everything’s fine. We just started talking about living arrangements.
19670,Leonard,Does it bother you?
19671,Leonard,We’re not selling his tomatoes on eBay.
19672,Leonard,Penny you know I’m lactose intolerant.
19673,Raj,It’s a Christmas miracle.
19674,Penny,Okay. Sheldon let me ask you a question.
19675,Penny,Or maybe now that I’m no longer an out-of-work actress who can’t pay for her own dinner that makes you a little insecure.
19676,Penny,Well you sound like one now. I don’t see the big deal if my brother comes and stays for a while.
19677,Leonard,So uh Priya what are your plans while you’re here.
19678,Raj,I didn’t ask you to set me up with Lakshmi.
19679,Raj,Thank you but it doesn’t look like I’m going to Comic-Con this year.
19680,Howard,Hey.
19681,Leonard,Will Wil want it?
19682,Sheldon,The telephone. You know Leonard in your own simple way you may be the wisest of us all. Voice mail. Curiouser and curiouser.
19683,Penny,Do people like money? Is that what you’re asking?
19684,Howard,We Indians invented them. You’re welcome.
19685,Howard,Bad news the Nigerian prince may be a fraud.
19686,Howard,I’m very happy you were able to hang out tonight.
19687,Leonard,Tomorrow.
19688,Penny,Headaches dizziness and nausea.
19689,Penny,Shut up. You know what I’ve been doing for the last hour?
19690,Sheldon,Oh. Well that’s all right. There were plenty of ways to pass the time before smart phones were invented.
19691,Penny,Uh you’re sad about not getting anything done last night so you’re gonna sit around and pout about it?
19692,Leonard,Oh wow.
19693,Sheldon,Well I had just begun puberty. It was figuratively and literally one of the hairiest moments of my life.
19694,Leonard,See this right here what you’re doing can you please not do that around Sheldon’s mom?
19695,Raj,You know Sheldon if we apply to be one of those teams we could be on the ground floor of something big not just for theoretical physics but for astrophysics as well.
19696,Howard,Okay now I just need to make sure I have a Lalita before I meet the grasshopper. It’s a sweet green miracle.
19697,Sheldon,It’s awful. This morning she arranged for me to be an Amtrak junior conductor for the day. It it’s usually only open to children. She got them to make an exception.
19698,Howard,Okay just put it on my calendar but start thinking of a reason why I can’t go alrighty? Koothrappali out. God bless that boy I don’t know what I’d do without him.
19699,Leonard,No. I did have a shot with the Lisatronic but the extension cord wasn’t long enough.
19700,Leonard,You say thank you.
19701,Sheldon,Hey! He did that on purpose
19702,Sheldon,The fun thing about Prince Joey is every time he moves there’s a one-in-five chance he’ll kill himself.
19703,Howard,Okay if I upset you then why didn’t you just say something?
19704,Sheldon,Well whether you see it or not is irrelevant. I can’t see subatomic particles but nevertheless they’re there.
19706,Raj,Excuse me. I’m going to go wander the streets alone. Invisible unwanted and unloved a pathetic shadow in a city with no heart.  I forgot my windbreaker. It’s chilly.
19707,Sheldon,Oh I believe that was something else I wasn’t supposed to mention.
19709,Penny,Zzz-zz-zz-zz! Second of all the door to the stairwell of the other building was locked so I had to go down the fire escape which ends on the third floor forcing me to crawl through the window of a lovely Armenian family who insisted I stay for lunch.
19710,Sheldon,No I’m just allergic to people who get Nobel Prizes for no good reason.
19711,Leonard,Oh yay for me. What about you guys? I can’t promise anything but people do make money off stuff like this.
19712,Howard,Ah I’m making a necklace for my mom.
19713,Sheldon,Not so good.
19714,Leonard,Can I use your phone? Our car got stolen.
19715,Leonard,What?
19716,Penny,That’s the saddest thing I’ve ever heard.
19717,Howard,37 minutes left until the deadline.
19718,Leonard,Sheldon we still have 380 of these things to make.
19719,Leonard,Hey honey.
19720,Sheldon,You’re obviously good at what you do.
19721,Sheldon,Just being the unsocialised eccentric my mother always thought I was.
19723,Sheldon,Oh just let me look. Oh my goodness. I see quivering black lines. Those must be neurons oh they’re so thick and beautiful.
19724,Penny,Oh okay well guess I’m your new neighbour Penny.
19725,Howard,No no. After we got undressed and jumped in bed you you asked if I had protection.
19726,Leonard,You’re right I really should be asking strangers on the Internet.
19727,Sheldon,There’s only 30 seconds left in the auction.
19728,Penny,Not great. Can I talk to you for a sec?
19729,Penny,Amy.
19730,Leonard,Great.
19731,Leonard,Hey buddy.
19732,Penny,Well…
19733,Penny,I mean really what’s so great about being grown up?
19734,Howard,Sorry. Walking tree.
19735,Sheldon,Speaking of love STDs among the elderly are skyrocketing.
19736,Penny,Why are you sitting in the stairwell?
19737,Sheldon,On the other hand that low-down polecat done wronged my woman.
19738,Leonard,Well we should call her.
19739,Penny,You actually put that in an agreement?
19740,Raj,That works.
19741,Sheldon,But we haven’t finished the puzzle.
19742,Leonard,What do you got?
19743,Sheldon,Of course I’m sure. Look at the beta-function of quantum chrono-dynamics the sign’s been changed.
19744,Penny,Well what happened with your dad?
19745,Howard,You know I heard of this way of watching the movies called the Machete Order where you watch Episodes IV and V then skip Episode I watch II and III as a flashback and then finish with VI.
19746,Howard,I like it.
19747,Leonard,So Sheldon how you doing?
19748,Sheldon,Mm it’s hard to say. I can only speculate based on the data I collected watching my parents’ marriage implode. In that case the woman dives into religion while the man dives into a bottle-blonde bartender who tries to buy my love with action figures. Oop! Out of arrows.
19749,Sheldon,Before you do please give me one more chance to apologize to Emily.
19750,Leonard,And of course Mom.
19751,Leonard,No. I actually felt kinda silly just saying on the down-low.
19752,Penny,You’re not curious who she’s out with?
19753,Leonard,Hey did you ever make it to the dentist?
19754,Leonard,You don’t honestly think that do you?
19755,Leonard,Except this is totally about my mom.
19757,Sheldon,Wait a question who decides if someone’s gone off topic?
19758,Raj,‘Cause that’s what little matzo balls do.
19759,Raj,From the future? How fun and imaginative.
19760,Raj,C3PO.
19761,Howard,Wow you just don’t get it do you? Buying me something pretty isn’t going to make our problem just go away.
19762,Leonard,Sure we could write something up.
19763,Leonard,Sheldon you do this all the time. You fixate on some crazy idea and then blow it way out of proportion.
19764,Leonard,Well I can do without the 40-minute car ride where she criticizes every aspect of my life.
19765,Leonard,Yeah I know I still can’t afford it.
19766,Leonard,So you’ll send him an e-mail when we get back.
19767,Howard,What are negs?
19768,Sheldon,Of course you will. It’s impossible to pay me back sooner than you can. Assuming you subscribe to a linear understanding of time and causality.
19769,Leonard,Yeah. It’s a deviated septum. The surgery to correct it is simple. He’s gonna do it next week.
19770,Penny,Oh I know I’m going to regret this but what trauma?
19771,Raj,May I ask what this is about?
19772,Leonard,Except in Knight Rider the car isn’t a yammering sphincter.
19773,Howard,Look we admit it. The idea that you guys came up with was really good and I’d love your help.
19774,Penny,Oh you seem extra happy.
19775,Sheldon,Yeah shut up Sheldon.
19776,Leonard,Yeah. And I’m a little worried because things between us have been so great and I’d hate to do anything that screws that up.
19777,Penny,Thank you.
19778,Sheldon,Aw how nice. Well a space opened up at the last minute on the NSF expedition to the Arctic Circle.
19779,Leonard,And that’s based on the inherent credit-worthiness of people who get drunk and urinate on police vehicles?
19780,Leonard,Maybe.
19781,Sheldon,No. What you see is a man trembling with confidence. Does a locus coeruleus normally bleed that much?
19783,Raj,You mean the strong sexy angel I can’t stop thinking about? Who can say?
19784,Penny,All that and he’s shorter than me.
19785,Howard,Sticks and stones may break my bones but chairs on sticks are comfy.
19786,Sheldon,Thank you Leonard.
19787,Sheldon,Why would I change?
19788,Penny,What do you want?
19789,Sheldon,I’m sorry. I’m looking for a barber and I’m running out of time. My hair is growing at the rate of 4.6 yoctometers per femtosecond. I mean if you’re quiet you can hear it.
19790,Penny,Well that’s always been a secret. Not even Amy knows.
19791,Sheldon,Uh Stuart I was wondering if you could help me find something.
19792,Leonard,I get it. Smallville almost wrecked you.
19793,Raj,There are no solar flares right now.
19795,Raj,I really can’t thank you enough for taking me in. You know I was in a pretty low place in my life.
19796,Sheldon,There’s just no pleasing you is there Leonard? You weren’t happy with my previous approach to dealing with her so I decided to employ operant conditioning techniques building on the work of Thorndike and B.F. Skinner. By this time next week I believe I can have her jumping out of a pool balancing a beach ball on her nose.
19797,Sheldon,That’s for the fire marshal to determine.
19798,Raj,Well if you want to guarantee his appeal to Stephanie your best bet would be to kill all the other men on the planet.
19799,Penny,Get one yourself.
19800,Howard,Hey you’re just in time. We made Tex-Mex.
19801,Sheldon,A little misunder…. Galileo and the Pope had a little misunderstanding.
19802,Leonard,What did you spill on it?
19803,Howard,What’s wrong with Jiffy Lubes?
19804,Sheldon,Be right back.
19805,Penny,What is it secret?
19806,Leonard,You know what? I don’t have to stand here and take this crap. 
19807,Howard,Ooh gossip. When I first got here I thought you Americans really gossiped around the water cooler. So I hung out there for like a month but the only gossip I ever heard was about some creepy guy hanging out by the water cooler.
19808,Penny,Ooh awesome okay I totally like to initiate I’m a big old five.
19809,Raj,Look Penny you’re great but I had a long talk with my parents and they said if I date an Indian girl I get a Maserati.
19810,Leonard,Give me a minute. Sheldon
19811,Penny,What kind of deal?
19812,Penny,No. I never told anyone that. But I did write it in my journal.
19813,Howard,Sometimes I put the TV on mute just to pretend she’s still with me. But I can’t watch the closed captioning without crying.
19814,Penny,Okay so he’s got money and it’s a few gifts and a car.
19815,Sheldon,Ramona pointed out that I’ve been wasting 20 minutes a day standing on cafeteria lines.
19816,Leonard,You feel like trying something new for dinner? Maybe Indian Tex-Mex?
19817,Penny,Not as good as you apparently.
19818,Sheldon,Yeah well get this neither does Penny that’s why she doesn’t want to go. You set ’em up I knock ’em down good job.
19819,Penny,I’m so sorry. I never should have read that book. You know what? You want to just get dinner and watch the game here?
19820,Penny,Sure.
19821,Howard,Yeah you keep setting me up for failure.
19823,Leonard,Has he ever had his own place?
19824,Sheldon,Marty and Doc never had have had brought?
19825,Howard,Oh not just him you’re coming too.
19826,Penny,Wow.
19827,Sheldon,All right we’ve defeated the first challenge. Now we must steel ourselves to face the monster who defends the gate.
19828,Leonard,It’s you.
19829,Leonard,What is his hurry?
19830,Penny,Okay lady you are way out of line.
19831,Leonard,Wow that’s very nice.
19832,Penny,Call me crazy but I found it moving.
19833,Penny,I can’t believe I’m saying this but can we watch the news or something?
19834,Leonard,Oh hi.
19835,Leonard,Without.
19836,Leonard,Right? To this day I send her a card every year with a little money in it.
19837,Sheldon,Well I’ll let you get back to your date.
19838,Leonard,Okay. Wouldn’t you be more comfortable at home?
19839,Sheldon,Flattery will not get you this job Ms. Jenson.
19840,Sheldon,Oh. It was amazing. I I saw it a few days later. What a movie.
19841,Leonard,Bye.
19842,Sheldon,I believe I can answer that. Uh like me Raj is demonstrating empathy. Now why don’t you accept my apology receive your free T-shirt uh I hope extra small is okay. For some reason Wolowitz took a medium.
19843,Penny,Yep there they are.
19844,Leonard,Well I’m sure the guy living with Sheldon wouldn’t mind moving in with you.
19845,Sheldon,My objection was based on considerations other than difficulty.
19846,Sheldon,What do I search?
19847,Sheldon,Amy?
19848,Sheldon,Well all right. What if I apologize to all of them?
19849,Sheldon,Wait no. We haven’t picked a winner.
19850,Penny,And I can’t believe you’ve never read Eat Pray Love.
19851,Howard,Guys fifteen seconds.
19852,Sheldon,Or if they accept Daddy’s application to live on Mars.
19853,Leonard,After we go through the exercise of an annoying series of votes all of which the gentleman will lose does he then intend to threaten to quit if he does not get his way?
19854,Raj,Like dude on dude but with women?
19855,Sheldon,Little comfort tonight. I look like a Hell’s Angel.
19856,Sheldon,102.2. Exactly what it was half an hour ago. It’s like you’re not even trying to get better.
19857,Leonard,What is happening there?
19858,Sheldon,It’s not fair. Penny isn’t making Leonard hold hands.
19859,Penny,Don’t say anything. act surprised when she tells you. All right how you want to do this?
19860,Raj,In more ways than one. He’s a very handsome man.
19861,Howard,Oh boy.
19862,Leonard,You can’t find a card that says that?
19863,Penny,Well he sent me a football and a catcher’s mitt for Christmas so I’m going to say no.
19864,Sheldon,You don’t need to know you don’t deserve to know and you will never know.
19865,Penny,Is she okay?
19866,Penny,I’m not recommending it. I’m saying it already happened.
19867,Howard,It was a classic western set in the post-Jurassic period and it changed my life.
19868,Penny,Yeah.
19869,Leonard,That’s the thing you can’t. I’ll be on a ship in the North Sea.
19870,Leonard,You’re welcome to come.
19871,Howard,You could go to my guy. He’s at Juan-Juan in Beverly Hills. They bring you a cup of tea they’ll massage your scalp. It’s about two hundred dollars but sometimes you look in the next chair and you see a superstar like Tony Danza.
19872,Leonard,Shut up.
19873,Sheldon,I thought I could take you out to a nice birthday dinner. If we pick a place east of here we might find the balloon.
19874,Leonard,Now let’s not do anything rash. She’s really hot.
19875,Penny,No.
19876,Penny,Oh that’s true.
19877,Leonard,What are we doing?
19878,Sheldon,Whenever you’re ready.
19879,Sheldon,Yeah well and you admit it like a man. All you hear women say is I’ll just have a salad. You know? Where’s my lip gloss? I think this element should be called radium. That last one was Madame Curie.
19880,Raj,Well it’s kind of hard to tell.
19881,Howard,You know you keep quoting Wrath of Khan but he was in next generation. It’s a totally different set of characters.
19882,Sheldon,But you don’t even know…
19883,Howard,You want a real challenge try keeping me from eating more of these.
19884,Sheldon,Watery?
19885,Penny,Good I’m just having little trouble with the glue.
19887,Leonard,Yeah.
19888,Sheldon,Oh dear lord Leonard look. He’s still available for parties and events. We should hire him.
19889,Leonard,Wireless webcams wave hello.
19890,Sheldon,I don’t know how to process that.
19891,Sheldon,Because it made me realize they’ll just send anyone up there. Aren’t you going to let me out?
19893,Sheldon,How come I never get to do anything I want to do?
19894,Howard,Don’t be silly. Sit. You look like you’ve had a long day.
19895,Howard,Why so glum chum?
19896,Leonard,Smile. 
19897,Leonard,I am such an asthmatic dumbass. I had a weird night.
19898,Penny,How could you not tell us you were in beauty pageants?
19899,Howard,I also love the enemies of America.
19900,Sheldon,You do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds of you having sexual congress with this woman?
19902,Sheldon,Excuse me may I interject?
19904,Raj,Yeah maybe we’ll get lucky with some sexy cowgirls.
19905,Leonard,Because well Batman has the secret.
19906,Sheldon,Yes.
19907,Leonard,Let me refresh your memory.
19908,Sheldon,Unacceptable the delay would result in tomorrow morning’s bowel movement occurring at work.
19909,Leonard,Relax. I know when you go for a run you stop for a donut.
19910,Sheldon,Old comic books. I lost this to Wolowitz in an ill-considered cricket wager.
19911,Penny,No honey baked ham in a hot tub got it.
19912,Raj,Look I’m not the kind of guy who drops his friends just because he’s in a relationship.
19913,Leonard,Oh God what’s that smell? . Oh-ho-hoo!
19914,Howard,So Bernadette have you thought about how you’re going to redecorate this place?
19915,Penny,Uh it’s kind of a lot. You know let me do a little tonight and I’ll catch up with you guys later.
19916,Leonard,So this button here will allow you to scan a new equation but over here you can press this and just substitute new values for the coefficients.
19917,Sheldon,And welcome to a special retrospective where we will take a look back at the history of Fun with Flags on an episode we’re calling…
19919,Sheldon,Good morning Dr. Stephanie. I trust Leonard satisfied you sexually last night.
19920,Sheldon,Okay one vote for one vote against. Leonard you’re the tiebreaker.
19921,Raj,Come on Howard help me.
19922,Howard,Really? A robot hand’s got a death grip on your junk dude. That’s funny ask anyone.
19923,Penny,I went into this marriage with so much hope.
19924,Sheldon,Yes?
19925,Raj,What did they give you?
19926,Howard,You can’t ruin a friendship with sex. That’s like trying to ruin ice cream with chocolate sprinkles.
19927,Leonard,As a matter of fact I.. I… I can’t… I can’t… I can’t do it.
19928,Sheldon,I love Lisa Simpson.
19929,Sheldon,Yeah I think we should talk about that.
19930,Leonard,We really want to see this. Is there anything you can do?
19931,Penny,You’re probably right.
19932,Penny,Dr. Lorvis?
19933,Sheldon,She does. 42 minutes in.
19934,Sheldon,Wonderful security system if we’re attacked by a school of tuna.
19935,Sheldon,Where are you going?
19936,Sheldon,So lack of a physiological response while lying is characteristic of a violent sociopath.
19937,Leonard,Hope-hope no girls rip my clothes off on the way.
19938,Sheldon,Helping anyone. People should take care of themselves.
19939,Sheldon,Yeah good for you Leonard. That’s a lovely little notion. Kind of like I wish I could talk to my uncle in Chicago. Yeah now stand back while I invent the telephone. Hello? Oh hold on. Leonard it’s your uncle. He says you just got burned.
19941,Penny,Yeah see what’s happening here signals brain damage. My God how long does this thing spin for?
19942,Leonard,Penny as a scientist my job is to figure out why things happen. But I don’t think I’ll ever understand how someone like me could get to be with someone like you. You know maybe I don’t
19943,Raj,Oh yeah? What if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to take a shower in the locker room and let other guys see you naked?
19944,Raj,I think I know the answer to this but just to be clear it’s not me right?
19945,Howard,Every night.
19946,Leonard,I’m no expert but I think the hook has to go through the worm.
19947,Leonard,Well trust me I wish it never happened.
19948,Sheldon,Now of course if that is the result of a glandular condition and not sloth and gluttony I withdraw that comment.
19949,Raj,Did you guys see there’s an Avengers screening? Joss Whedon’s gonna show some deleted scenes and do a question and answer session.
19950,Leonard,Oh. Did not know that.
19951,Sheldon,No I’m going to the comic book store.
19952,Penny,Oh hey I was just on my way to work.
19953,Penny,It is. You’re the best dad ever.
19954,Sheldon,Just a few things you may need tonight. There’s uh baby oil condoms and uh a little something I procured from the school of pharmacology. They say it is to Viagra as Viagra is to a green M&M.
19955,Leonard,Oh hey Wil. Nice of you to make it out tonight for Howard.
19956,Leonard,That a problem?
19957,Leonard,I wouldn’t worry about it. She’s probably just distracted by work.
19958,Penny,Leonard help.
19959,Raj,What you don’t like wind chimes?
19960,Howard,Forbaded it?
19961,Raj,It’s also a live mine so there’ll be dynamite explosions going off in the distance.
19962,Sheldon,No. The two achievements are equally surprising and equally admirable though if pressed I’d have to give a slight edge to the cat. I’ll save you the pain and nervousness of waiting for the answer. I agree to be part of your project. Congratulations.
19963,Howard,I’m calling her. And the threesome didn’t deserve the belly laugh it got.
19964,Penny,Hey. Do you want to talk?
19965,Leonard,– We took the red-eye.
19966,Howard,You saw her. She looks like Jim Carrey from Dumb and Dumber.
19967,Howard,What?
19968,Leonard,Come on you know you’re not leaving physics. Why are you doing this?
19969,Howard,I haven’t had sex in a year.
19970,Leonard,It’s not funny. That mistake got published.
19971,Leonard,Okay next question for the Butterfinger. How long is a galactic yea
19972,Sheldon,Counterproposal. I will gently stroke your head and repeat aw who’s a good Amy.
19973,Sheldon,Only way we’ll know for sure is if we post it online to the pre-print server. I have it ready to go but I wasn’t gonna do it without you.
19974,Sheldon,If I’d known you were broke I wouldn’t have made a big deal about the bread.
19975,Penny,Yeah that’s rude.
19976,Sheldon,I suppose I could try getting rid of the golf ball.
19977,Leonard,It’s locked but suddenly the door behind you slams shut and now the walls of the room start closing in.
19978,Howard,If she did it would be amazing. That woman can do no wrong.
19979,Raj,Thank you. ‘Cause if she ever found out it would hurt her feelings.
19980,Sheldon,That is why the duel will take place at high noon three years from today. If you’re worth your salt as an instructor I should be ready by then. Yeah and be warned. I’m going to touch you all over.
19981,Penny,I’m sorry. Look do you have a second.
19982,Raj,Okay.
19983,Leonard,So you think you should keep it?
19984,Sheldon,Well I never thought of it like that. Boy frame of reference will just sneak up on you won’t it?
19985,Raj,My father thinks the reason I can’t make a relationship work is because I’m spoiled.
19986,Penny,Oh it’s about time. I hated the old way. Hi. I’m Penny.
19987,Sheldon,Don’t laugh she wasn’t joking.
19988,Sheldon,Actually it’s three against one.
19989,Leonard,Okay first of all Penny thank you for coming.
19990,Sheldon,Oh no it’s all right. I think of my time with Amy as a stick of Fruit Stripe gum. Sweet and enjoyable at first but ultimately a flavourless lump of sadness.
19991,Leonard,I didn’t screw it up.
19992,Sheldon,The earliest estimate of the singularity when man will be able to transfer his consciousness into machines and achieve immortality.
19993,Penny,Hey guys the building manager said the reason the power went out is someone went down into the basement and just pulled the main breaker switch.
19994,Sheldon,This is Thai food.
19995,Penny,What am I up to now?
19996,Penny,Oh they don’t always get to ride the roller coaster. Sometimes they only get to spin the teacups. Now I’m going out tonight. Would it be crazy to ask you to look at the outfit I’m going to wear?
19997,Raj,But Howard…
19998,Penny,Um can we talk to you about Raj?
19999,Penny,Oh sweetie you’d be the last one to know about it.  Hmm cute dresses. I bet this looks great on you!
20000,Sheldon,Yeah no kidding. Despite what it says on her résumé she is no longer 22.
20001,Sheldon,Look at Planck’s Constant. People say it’s arbitrary. It could not be less arbitrary. If it varied even slightly life as we know it would not exist. Bam! Now now let’s reconsider the entire argument but with entropy reversed and effect preceding cause so you are thinking of a universe that’s not expanding from the centre no it is retreating from a from a possibility space. Bam! This is a space where we are all essentially Alice through the looking glass standing in front the Red Queen and we’re being offered a cracker to quench our thirst. Bam! Of course in another universe let’s call it universe prime there’s another Sheldon let’s call him Sheldon prime…
20002,Leonard,Yes.
20003,Raj,Hey look at that.  It’s Dennis Kim.
20004,Sheldon, I am very very sorry for what I have done. Here’s your laundry I rescind your strikes and you are no longer banished.
20005,Raj,I have a better idea.
20006,Leonard,What?
20007,Sheldon, Leonard?
20008,Penny,Yeah once he figures out how to work a door.
20009,Leonard,Once again I’m driving. I’m right here.
20010,Sheldon,Really how does it work?
20011,Leonard,Howard that’s racist any fifteen year-old girl will do the trick. 
20012,Sheldon,We were next to a car with an ask me about my grandchildren bumper sticker and I was afraid if we ran into them on the way out I’d be obligated to do so.
20013,Sheldon,This is banana bread.
20014,Leonard,What makes you think I can convince her?
20015,Sheldon,Maybe it’s because I’m not an elitist. What I’d like to know is how does this gravity wave breakthrough help the man on the street? You know? Who’s looking out for Joe six-pack and all his quantum physics concerns?
20016,Raj,You brought your mother into this!
20017,Penny,Oh well you know Leonard is great.
20018,Raj,I just got an e-mail from my ex-girlfriend Lucy. She misses me and wants to get together.
20019,Sheldon,All right I’ll just toss this out to the room. Um I was thinking that the best way to fight my addiction is by weaning myself off in steps. Now I couldn’t find a caffeine patch but I did find what claims to be a mind-boosting caffeine suppository. You know the interesting fact about the rectum…
20020,Sheldon,But that’s my room.
20021,Howard,As you wish.
20022,Raj,I’m taking a stroll and I’m sporting wood.
20023,Raj,As much as I appreciate this I can’t accept it okay? Halley’s my goddaughter I don’t take care of her for money.
20024,Sheldon,Um to go to Jewish heaven?
20025,Sheldon,Do I miss how he makes a face on my toaster waffle with syrup? No. Do I miss the way he fixes the zipper on my jacket when it gets stuck? I don’t think so. Do I miss how we say good night to each other through the walls of our bedroom using Morse code? 
20026,Penny,Oh my God a treasure chest I’m rich!
20027,Penny,Sorry.
20028,Leonard,Look all she’s saying is we are in love so it doesn’t matter if we get married tomorrow or a year from now or 50 years from now.
20029,Leonard,To my room.
20030,Leonard,You have my blessing. Go for it.
20031,Howard,It’s like we both had these holes in our lives but now we fill each other’s holes.
20032,Leonard,Really? What’d they say?
20033,Penny,Ooh maybe a little Rodeo Drive.
20034,Leonard,Okay let’s just skip all the inventions you can have sex with. All right no here we go ergonomic heated seat cushion.
20035,Leonard,Look here’s the thing you need to understand about Sheldon. He’s the worst.
20036,Raj,Smart looks like we’re being helpful.
20037,Raj,We’ll switch. You’ll come sit with me after intermission.
20038,Sheldon,Yes I’m getting a free pizza. I’m on a roll.
20039,Sheldon,Hold on. We don’t know anything about this woman.
20040,Raj,I’m not sure. Um wait. Jump up and down let’s see if they jiggle. Uh no I I still can’t tell uh oh you know what? Okay uh give me some of this.
20041,Raj,But someone joined our page. We have an actual fan.
20042,Sheldon,Have you seen Penny eat Chinese food she uses a fork and she double dips her egg rolls.
20043,Howard,Guys fifteen seconds.
20044,Raj,You know many people believe that home births are better because the mother is in a warm comfortable environment where she can be nurtured by loved ones.
20045,Sheldon,I know the real reason you never made progress with that idea. You thought of it September 22nd 2007. Two days later Penny moved in and so much blood rushed to your genitals your brain became a ghost town.
20046,Sheldon,Well that snuck up on us didn’t it?
20047,Howard,Thirty seconds.
20048,Sheldon,No. It would appear as if I’ve lost him. Stupid brain.
20049,Raj,Just to be clear financially or mid-sentence?
20050,Penny,Why so you can crawl under the covers and go hey baby want to go look for houses in neighbourhoods with good schools?
20051,Leonard,What you looking at?
20052,Raj,Nope. Gates gave a speech at the university. Sheldon went up to him afterwards and said maybe if you weren’t so distracted by sick children in Africa you could have put a little more thought into Windows Vista.”
20053,Leonard,Sheldon I’m not a whiner.
20054,Raj,Hey why am I in charge of phone support? Seems a bit racist.
20055,Howard,Oh hey.
20056,Leonard,No no no no no. You just need you just need you just need to map it out. Come on I’ll help you. So uh you stopped at the stream and you turned north three times?
20057,Howard,Yes I’ll take you back.
20058,Sheldon,I had to sanitize my hands because the university replaced the paper towels in the rest rooms with hot air blowers.
20059,Penny,Well I don’t think she wants to talk to anyone right now.
20060,Raj,I can’t believe you kissed my sister with moth mouth.
20061,Leonard,It says right here on Wikipedia. A Mexican standoff is a confrontation between at least three parties.
20062,Penny,Okay bye.  Means I wish you weren’t going.
20063,Sheldon,I don’t care. Amy there was a song I couldn’t get out of my head. Eventually I realized the song was about you and like that earworm I can’t get you out of my heart. So what I’m trying to say is you’re my heartworm. The metaphorical kind not not the poodle-killing kind.
20064,Raj,As soon as I have the place set up I’m gonna have you guys over.
20065,Howard,I couldn’t find you guys so I bought six new friends. Three sadly are dead.
20066,Sheldon,Hmm? Well she spends her whole day scooping. One arm’s probably bigger than the other.
20067,Leonard,I don’t care. She’s upset I’m going over there.
20069,Penny,Going to see Leonard?
20070,Leonard,And he’s down!
20071,Sheldon,I also say don’t contradict me in front of my friends but that you don’t remember.
20072,Leonard,What?
20074,Penny,Three bags no one’s opened ’em. we’re the first ones here.
20075,Leonard,Well aliens could only play the Golden Record if they figured out how to build a record player.
20076,Howard,Sure. Let go of the ring.
20077,Leonard,Hi Penny.
20078,Sheldon,Well played.
20079,Penny,You bet. I had dreams you know. I was gonna be famous. Show everybody back home I could be someone. Now look at me. Want some?
20080,Leonard,No it’s not gonna do it.
20081,Penny,Hey Daddy.
20082,Penny,Oh. That’s Anais none of the other girls in the house like her.
20083,Leonard,Not some kind of nerd I am the king of the nerds.
20084,Howard,Sounds about right.
20085,Penny,What are you saying that I’m threatened by Alicia? That I’m like the old queen of the hive and it’s just time for me to go?
20086,Leonard,If you want help just hire a grad student.
20087,Penny,Hey that’s good. Why’d you guys stop doing that?
20088,Sheldon,And the answer was Zack correct?
20089,Howard,Uh Lucy’s coming over. I need some advice.
20090,Leonard,I feel like I pulled something. Why didn’t you tell me to stop?
20091,Penny,I cannot believe you guys aren’t going to play with these.
20092,Sheldon,Correct.
20093,Leonard,Oh uh you know because we’re friends.
20094,Sheldon,Hmm. Yes. Look at him Amy. It’s such a shame. Struck down in the prime of my life.
20095,Leonard,I I’m fine.
20096,Penny,Good night.
20097,Sheldon,Uh uh I couldn’t help but notice that you cut the line.
20098,Sheldon,You’re too late.
20099,Penny,Oh they went to the store to get solder which is metal you melt to make science things.
20100,Howard,That’s my joke. I told it last night. You can’t just use it.
20101,Leonard,Sheldon you don’t give your mother enough credit. She’s warm she’s loving she doesn’t glue electrodes to your head to measure your brain waves while potty training.
20102,Penny,Did your boyfriend make you type that?
20103,Penny,Mmmm.
20104,Penny,Yeah just a heads-up on the car window deal. It helps but everything is not peachy.
20105,Penny,What?
20106,Leonard,Oh that’s nice. Most people her age don’t embrace technology.
20107,Leonard,Monday morning I’ll go downtown look up the owner’s information and send him the DVD. Pay the late fee and prove to Sheldon that you can have a problem and solve it without acting like a complete lunatic. Ah!
20108,Sheldon,Well what passes for science on dating sites. They claim to use heuristic algorithms but it may well be hokum.
20109,Sheldon,I don’t know two three days. Not important. I don’t need sleep I need answers. I need to determine where in this swamp of unbalanced formulas squatteth the toad of truth.
20110,Sheldon,And you’re frustrated because he phrased his reply in the form of a meaningless tautology?
20111,Leonard,That would be great. Thank you.
20112,Leonard,No I mean since the Shamy hit a reef.
20113,Sheldon,If I can interject again. Leonard comes from a remarkably high-achieving family who have all chosen high-achieving partners. He probably feels that it’s doubtful that his mother will be overly impressed with his dating a woman whose most significant achievement is memorizing the Cheesecake Factory menu.
20114,Penny,Hey guys. Enjoying your food that I actually brought you instead of promising food but bringing you a box of random crap?
20115,Leonard,Sure sure just I don’t know much about football.
20116,Penny,It’s just since we got married you seem to think you don’t have to try any more.
20117,Sheldon,Leonard would you be a lamb?
20118,Penny,And now you see the problem.
20119,Sheldon,Well this is ridiculous. Being upset about Amy all the time isn’t accomplishing anything. If I want to resolve this situation then I need to take action.
20120,Sheldon,Well so far I’ve come up with three ideas. The first is a chance for her to play the harp with the L.A. Philharmonic.
20121,Leonard,What does your agent think?
20122,Leonard,Wesley Crusher was Wil Wheaton’s character on Star Trek.
20123,Sheldon,You know I’m not the only one who’s unpleasant when they’re sick. When Penny got food poisoning she threw up so loudly I could barely hear the television.
20124,Sheldon,Obviously not a cleaning business.
20125,Howard,We could go up to Big Bear and get a house on the lake.
20126,Leonard,So what are you guys gonna do today?
20127,Sheldon,Not likely. KoKo learned to understand over 2000 words not one of which had anything to do with shoes.
20128,Leonard,Sheldon what do you think you’re doing?
20129,Penny,Well tell you one thing if I ever do get married no Klingon invitations.
20130,Leonard,You still want to get married right?
20131,Leonard,Why? What are you afraid of?
20133,Raj,Overdo what? Happiness? Freedom? This warm glow inside of me that promises everything is going to be all hunky donkey?
20134,Leonard,We all do. Now how about dinner?
20135,Leonard,Yeah but why didn’t you go back to your apartment?
20136,Penny,Yeah it must have been. I just threw up in my closet.
20137,Leonard,So it’s a family film.
20138,Sheldon,No no this is a slippery slope Leonard. It starts with a parking space where does it end? It’s like my dad always said first they say you can’t drink and drive next thing you know you can’t let your 10-year-old take the wheel while you sleep one off in the backseat.
20139,Howard,I don’t understand.
20140,Sheldon,Well you have a brown fleck in your right iris that looks like a Formula One race car. So I’m just concentrating on that. Plus it’s easier around people that I’m comfortable with.
20141,Raj,No thanks.
20142,Penny,Um okay. Can I ask you a favour.
20143,Howard,Okay everybody. Who’s ready for a scavenger hunt?  each each puzzle will lead you to the location of the next the last of which will lead you to the coin. The first team that finds it wins.
20144,Howard,What’s the first one?
20145,Raj,I haven’t had sex in a year.
20146,Leonard,I wasn’t gonna get beat up.
20147,Penny,You had a panic attack when we went through the car wash.
20148,Leonard,It’s fine. You win.
20149,Leonard,Nothing you’re perfect.
20150,Penny,Thank you for the clarification.
20151,Sheldon,No I can’t. This isn’t right.
20152,Howard,But theoretically if you and I were in a gay relationship how would we tell people? Like print up announcements?
20153,Penny,Mm-hmm. Hey want to get a little crazy?
20154,Sheldon,It’s not optional. We’re out of tea. I hope you like bouillon.
20155,Sheldon,She made the case that if we break down in the middle of nowhere your Nebraska backwoods skills and brawny hands will give us the best chance to survive in the wild.
20156,Sheldon,Stop fighting me on the premise. It’s scientifically valid. I’m going to advance propositions I just want you to challenge me.
20157,Leonard,No.
20158,Sheldon,What are you doing?
20159,Leonard,You promised Penny what?
20160,Leonard,No I do not. You are a mean little man.
20161,Sheldon,I miss the old days when your romantic partners could be returned to the video store.
20162,Sheldon,She claimed to be alone when there was obviously someone else in her apartment. I have no choice but to assume the worst given Leonard’s lengthy sea voyage and her famously ravenous nether regions.
20163,Sheldon,Why would I? That’s where all the cool trains are.
20164,Howard,Yes.
20165,Raj,Oh we are bad boys aren’t we?
20166,Howard,Oh my God Kenny G? This woman can read me like a book. I can’t believe I bought my soul mate at Glendale Galleria.
20167,Raj,You were supposed to keep that to yourself.
20168,Sheldon,Been there.
20169,Howard,Wow. It’s an antique sextant. Sailors used these to find their position by the stars.
20170,Leonard,I can’t tell you that.
20172,Sheldon,I want to thank you all for coming on such short notice. Uh in the past I’ve reached out to each of you individually but I believe my present situation requires the collective wisdom of the group which as you can see from your commemorative T-shirts I have dubbed Sheldon Cooper’s Council of Ladies.
20173,Sheldon,I got the results back. Have you developed any of the following symptoms? A growing nose or perhaps a warm sensation in the trouser region? Also known as full-blown liar liar pants on fire.
20174,Howard,Dude I’m a single man. Saturday night is my party night.
20175,Penny,Yeah. That’s not what I had in mind.
20176,Leonard,What if he doesn’t?
20177,Penny,What?
20178,Raj,As if Valentine’s Day wasn’t bad enough you try to kill my dog? And with cheap chocolate no less?
20179,Sheldon,Because you don’t have a girlfriend? Well good Lord if that becomes a reason not to play Dungeons and Dragons this game’s in serious trouble.
20180,Penny,How was I supposed to know that?
20181,Sheldon, Penny.
20182,Sheldon,Maintaining five friendships promises to be a Herculean task. So I’m going to have to let one of you go.
20183,Penny,No you don’t. Oh hey what’s Sheldon supposed to be.
20184,Sheldon,I was enjoying some virtual reality until you ruined it with your actual face.
20185,Penny,All right Howard Wolowitz listen up. You sign anything she puts in front of you because you are the luckiest man alive. If you let her go there is no way you can find anyone else. Speaking on behalf of all women it is not gonna happen we had a meeting. And you a grown man fainting at the sight of a little blood.
20186,Penny,That’s what you took from that? The guy is married!
20187,Howard,Why not? With online shopping and overnight delivery I can get anything I want. Look I just ordered a case of Dinty Moore beef stew and two live lobsters on Amazon.
20188,Raj,Okay so once we receive the next image and compare it to the ones we’ve already collected we’ll know what it is that we found.
20189,Leonard,Mmm in a way. We presented papers and then broke off into focus groups and critiqued each other.
20190,Leonard,What are you doing?
20191,Sheldon,For goodness’ sake he’s wearing a hat glasses and a red striped shirt.
20192,Leonard,Celebrate your thirty under thirty thing. Right Sheldon? 
20193,Penny,I know but you did it. I’m so proud of you.
20194,Sheldon,Gentlemen. .
20195,Leonard,I’m sure she’ll still love him.
20196,Leonard,Is she suggesting what I think she’s suggesting?
20197,Leonard,I’ll help you.
20198,Sheldon,Over the years here at Fun With Flags we’ve had an opportunity to learn laugh wonder.
20199,Leonard,You know Penny we make such a good team maybe we could enter a couple of Halo tournaments sometime.
20200,Leonard,I know.
20201,Raj,Do not tell me about my own culture Sheldon! In the mood I’m in I’ll take you out I swear to cow!
20202,Howard,Well that seems fair.
20203,Sheldon,My plan is to stop at malls and buy what I need. It’s called living off the land.
20204,Sheldon,Not necessarily. I have four months to find some new friends.
20205,Sheldon,I should hope so. That’s from the first Spider-Man movie.
20206,Leonard,If it helps you sleep then why are you sitting here staring at me like the albino boogeyman?
20207,Raj,If you’re really a prostitute.
20208,Raj,Just dandy Mr I-Wish-I-Was-Better-At-Improv.
20209,Leonard,Why do you read his Twitter feed? You know it’s only going to upset you.
20210,Sheldon,Possibly.
20211,Penny,How can you call yourself a scientist and run out of solder?
20212,Sheldon,Well I had some of my best ideas in that room and I’m sure you will too.
20213,Leonard,Hey I know it’s none of my business but where did the money come from?
20214,Leonard,Good luck getting time on it. The only people he lets use it are his friends.
20215,Leonard,Okay fine what do you suggest?
20216,Raj,Okay. First order of physics bowl business. We need a truly kick-ass team name. Suggestions.
20217,Leonard,Oh you’re kidding me.
20218,Sheldon,Well then apparently you hate fun.
20219,Penny,Boy it’s good to be back.
20220,Sheldon,What are you doing?
20221,Sheldon,Because if she hadn’t she’d still be wading through the list.
20222,Sheldon,I’m not good with cold Leonard. How often have we had to leave a movie theatre because I got a headache from drinking the Icee too fast? I can’t go.
20223,Howard,Yeah I’m not quite sure how to respond.
20224,Leonard,Thank you for coming back.
20225,Leonard,I’ll show you how to do one.
20226,Raj,You help me run my game.
20227,Penny,But it’s a picture of you.
20228,Penny,Oh don’t tell me you’re afraid of germs.
20229,Penny,Nice save genius. Eggnog?
20230,Howard,Yeah you should have burned it down years ago.
20231,Raj,No no you’re pregnant. The only thing you carry is our hope for a better tomorrow.
20232,Howard,Somebody got the whole thing on a cell phone and put it on youtube.
20233,Penny,Hey I already set up Howard and Bernadette. It’s your turn to ruin some poor girl’s life.
20235,Sheldon,Can I at least have the upper GI? I already drank the barium!
20236,Penny,So how’s it going with Sheldon are you guys still not talking to each other?
20237,Leonard,Yeah.
20238,Penny,Do you want lemonade?
20239,Penny,I think it’s Bert.
20240,Penny,Okay okay how about this? We tell him somebody broke in.
20241,Leonard,I don’t care what the symptoms are my girlfriend is not going to give you a prostate exam.
20242,Howard,I have to return the helicopter. My father… What did you do?
20243,Leonard,You did flop around a lot.
20244,Sheldon,Priya?
20245,Leonard,No it’s a nitrogen laser. It’ll cook your eyeball like a soft-boiled egg.
20246,Sheldon,Oh it took me forever to get him on a bathroom schedule. He would just go whenever the mood struck him.
20247,Penny,Do you really mean that?
20248,Leonard,We’re not wasting time with names right now.
20249,Penny,Put it back in your pocket or I’ll find some other place to put it.
20250,Sheldon,No. You’re crazy about me.
20251,Penny,You said it’s a magic hammer.
20252,Sheldon,Oh so many things. Her mind her kindness and especially her body.
20253,Sheldon,We pretend we’re aliens. I’m not the best at reading facial cues but I’m gonna say that you love it and want to hear more. Now in the beloved novel Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy an alien named Ford Prefect pretended to be human in order to blend in so that he could write an entry about Earth for The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy which is a travel book within the actual book which is also called The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.
20254,Sheldon,I don’t know. What do you want to do?
20255,Penny,‘Cause if you’re still upset about that we don’t have to go.
20256,Leonard,That’s funny. Boy I’m gonna miss these painkillers.
20257,Leonard,But you don’t like other people.
20259,Raj,Oh yes I I too am in the throes of heartbreak. Okay fine I’ll tell you about it.
20260,Sheldon,Thank you.
20261,Sheldon,I used to collect them as a child. The spiral of scales open in the Fibonacci sequence. A fact that when you tell your brother gets a golf ball thrown at your head.
20262,Leonard,She didn’t tell you?
20263,Penny,Well a lot of people can’t. Uh hey.
20264,Sheldon,Leonard’s asleep.
20265,Sheldon,I do. And I wouldn’t be able to forgive myself if something happened to him and I wasn’t at his bedside to say I told you so.
20266,Raj,It’ll be okay.
20267,Sheldon,Well you should be. Because all I can think about is how much I want to kiss you. And not just on the cheek but on the mouth. Like mommies and daddies do.
20268,Raj,He loves you.
20269,Penny,How about I tell her the painting makes you feel jealous because you’re not in it?
20270,Sheldon,Wonderful. I just finished hanging the lights.
20271,Leonard,Why does it have to get weird?
20272,Sheldon,Wait. You were pretending?
20273,Howard,Uh go ahead. Read it.
20274,Sheldon,Got it. So I’m assuming nothing venereal. I’ll just tell her that you had a routine colonoscopy and haven’t quite bounced back.
20275,Penny,All right let’s shoot stuff. You want me to show you what to do?
20276,Sheldon,Eh it will be. Honestly if I must endure a long and tedious evening I’d rather it be with you on date night. But I have no choice. The tenure committee’s going to be there.
20277,Howard,Not to mention Malibu Koothrappali and his totally bitchin’ dream house.
20278,Leonard,I’m not glowing. I’m upset.
20279,Sheldon,Get them before they get us.
20280,Leonard,Yeah I don’t know Penny…
20281,Penny,Well so do I but don’t you want to live with your wife and set the thermostat to whatever you want and have your body tell you when it’s time to go to the bathroom you know not a schedule slipped underneath your door every morning?
20282,Penny,Mmm.
20283,Raj,Yeah. Well if you want to march in a fishnet crop top you better lay off that dip.
20284,Raj,Well I guess it goes back to when I was a fat kid in India and didn’t have any friends.
20285,Raj,I can’t. I’m too sick. Go away.
20286,Sheldon,I don’t know what we were worried about they’re getting along great.
20287,Sheldon,Bert did quality research and he deserves whatever accolades he receives.
20288,Penny,Great. I’ll see you later. And remember he’s more afraid of you than you are of him.
20289,Leonard,Aw.
20290,Leonard,Yeah. Pretty cool huh?
20291,Sheldon,Leonard please. His mother just died.
20292,Leonard,He got a cat to keep him company.
20293,Howard,Wow that’s rough. Where’d you get that?
20294,Sheldon,You see right through me don’t you?
20295,Leonard,Come on Sheldon we’re going to be late.
20296,Sheldon,Yes.
20297,Raj,Hey Stuart.
20298,Howard,Excuse me can I say something? I just love both you guys and I want you to get along. And when I say love I meant as a friend. And uh way too soon right?
20299,Leonard,That’s not helpful.
20300,Sheldon,Excuse me this is a fairly substantial wound. 
20301,Raj,Why don’t we go after your mother?
20302,Sheldon,Amy deserves better. You know when we buy the Planter’s deluxe mix she eats all the Brazil nuts so I don’t have to look at them. She’s a unique blend of saint and squirrel.
20303,Leonard,Thankfully Penny and I have a relationship based on honesty. What? I don’t lie to her.
20304,Sheldon,All right. This is a form indemnifying me from your use of Leonard’s bedroom. Sign here indicating that I tried to stop you and did so using a stern facial expression.
20305,Leonard,Th-th-th-that’s okay. I can infer from context.
20306,Sheldon,No I’m going to ask him to choose between sex and Halo 3. As far as I know sex has not been upgraded to include high-def graphics and enhanced weapon systems.
20307,Penny,Okay explain something to me. You watch Leonard put up with that guy for years and years. What has to break inside your brain for you to think Oh Krishna I’ve got to get me some of that?
20308,Howard,Do you think they gave Wolverine an Adamantium prostate?
20309,Howard,I would like to propose a salon topic.
20310,Sheldon,Yeah right on sister.
20311,Leonard,So Mother I’m surprised you came all this way for Sheldon’s birthday.
20312,Penny,Aw look at you watching sports.
20313,Sheldon,All right. Leonard went to  the office.
20314,Sheldon,Wow no foreplay or anything just right to it.
20315,Leonard,She hit on me.
20316,Leonard,Oh. You have other plans or…?
20317,Leonard,Well it turns out I had a little rocket fuel in the apartment.
20318,Howard,And how you threw up in zero gravity and it floated back in your mouth. And you threw up again. And so on and so on.
20319,Raj,Of course. All we need is to find stuff to make a lever big enough to fix this.
20320,Penny,I discovered a secret ingredient. The flavour packet. That sucker is well named. All right lover boy get ready ’cause there is a crap storm of romance coming your way.
20321,Leonard,Great.
20322,Leonard,I was going to do that.
20323,Raj,Uh Lucy’s coming over. I need some advice.
20324,Howard,Why don’t we go after your mother?
20325,Sheldon,Bailment describes a relationship in common law where a physical possession of personal property or chattels is transferred from one person the bailor to another person the bailee.
20326,Howard,Don’t ruin it for me man. I printed out a PDF to read on the potty.
20327,Penny,Oh yes. He says they are lost without you.
20328,Penny,Okay I’m just gonna go home and make a grilled cheese and window-shop on eHarmony.
20329,Sheldon,Yeah but the ones in my pocket are mine.
20330,Sheldon,Aha.
20331,Howard,I didn’t want to make this one.
20332,Howard,And where were you?
20333,Raj,Can I say I ruined you for white men?
20334,Howard,I hear what you’re saying but I’ve known Emily a long time and I think she deserves the benefit of the doubt.
20335,Sheldon,Oh yeah well I’ve already given this some thought and I’m willing to let Penny live with us one day a week for a trial period. Now obviously not when she’s made cranky by the shedding of her uterine lining.
20336,Penny,I don’t understand why you people just let him bully you like this. Someone should stand up to him. What’s he going to do?
20337,Leonard,What about loop quantum gravity?
20338,Leonard,I earned this. Back off.
20339,Sheldon,That’s smart because Sheldon 1 Amy 0.
20340,Sheldon,But I answered it’s called teamwork.
20341,Sheldon,Yeah just a heads-up Penny knows that you blabbed about Leonard. She’s pretty mad.
20342,Penny,Well how much you got in there?
20343,Sheldon,Aah! And after I let you be Gary.
20344,Leonard,I don’t.
20345,Penny,I think she means not a weirdo.
20346,Leonard,See you later.
20347,Leonard,Intellectually about 30 hours. Emotionally about 29 years.
20348,Raj,So where should we do it?
20349,Penny,So should we talk to each other or mingle?
20350,Leonard,I don’t I know but this isn’t a big deal. It’s just a little savings I put aside.
20351,Penny,You know maybe it won’t be that bad. Leonard says it’s really mainstream now. Comic books aren’t just for sad nerds any more. I mean it is still a key part of their demographic.
20352,Leonard,Should’ve punched that guy.
20353,Howard,So what’s up?
20354,Leonard,Uh-huh.
20355,Sheldon,No it’s the wise man. That’s why he’s called the wise man. You know how I know that? I’m the wise man.
20356,Leonard,Well you know we’re engaged and it’s kind of a big deal financially. It seems like something we should talk about.
20357,Sheldon,All right. I’ve devoted the prime of my life to string theory and its quest for the compactification of extra dimensions. I’ve got nothing to show for it and I feel like a fool.
20358,Leonard,Can it wait until I put a Band-Aid on a goat bite?
20359,Leonard,Hey you got a minute?
20360,Sheldon,My mother asked me to get some towels. I took advantage of the vague request and went to Bed Bath & Beyond.  Excuse me I’m on the phone. So rude.
20361,Sheldon,All right.
20362,Leonard,Yes. But I need a wing-man.
20363,Howard,What did she say?
20364,Sheldon,Thank you Amy. Here’s your cat. And here’s your $20.
20365,Sheldon,We’re going to the movies. What movie? What theatre? What time? If you were trying to make it impossible to locate you you couldn’t have done a better job.
20366,Sheldon,No. We failed in our noble quest.
20367,Leonard,Of course I’m going to do something. Uh Howard you check the comic book store. Raj go to the Thai restaurant. I’ll stay here with Penny in her apartment.  Oh damn it. It’s Sheldon’s mother. A break cannot be caught. Hi Mrs. Cooper. He is? Sheldon went home to Texas. Yeah no I know he resigned. Yes I guess it kind of is our fault. No no no you you’re right someone needs to come talk to him. Don’t worry I’ll take care of it. Yeah. All right. New plan. Howard you and Raj go to Texas. I’ll stay here with Penny in her apartment.
20368,Raj,Well I finished reading The Pelican Brief and loved it so much I dived right into The Client. He was a lawyer himself so his novels are accurate as well as entertaining.
20369,Sheldon,Oh hello.
20371,Sheldon,You do?
20372,Leonard,Okay. Come on. Upsy-daisy.
20373,Leonard,Oh wow cool.
20374,Penny,Yeah it’s also like when the Mountain fought the Red Viper in Game of Thrones.
20375,Sheldon,You forgot your flash drive You forgot your flash drive 
20376,Sheldon,You’re not going to do that and I’ll tell you why. This is an institution of higher learning I am your professor and you’re going to treat me with the prop… You shot your spit in my mouth!
20377,Leonard,Right. So all we need is to…
20378,Leonard,A place for fun a place for knowledge. See this man here’s playing hacky sack and this girl’s going to be a paralegal.
20379,Howard,Yes you are.
20380,Leonard,No no no no let’s talk about it. I’m the one who’s made all the effort in this relationship since day one. Please tell me what more I could do?
20381,Penny,I mean just because most of the men I’ve known in my life happen to be jerks doesn’t mean I should just assume Leonard and Sheldon are. Right?
20382,Sheldon,Well that approach has Sheldon Cooper written all over it.
20383,Sheldon,Fun? Mixing Dungeons and Dragons with Christmas is like making a sandwich of grape jelly the best-tasting jelly and petroleum jelly the worst-tasting jelly.
20384,Sheldon,You think with your penis.
20385,Penny,What the hell is wrong with you?
20386,Leonard,That’s not necessary when someone’s trying to help you.
20387,Penny,New shirts?
20388,Sheldon,We appear to be at a crossroads in our relationship Mother.
20389,Leonard,Yeah. It is by far the coolest thing I have ever owned.
20390,Penny,Look I said I wanted to hurt him but but this?
20391,Penny,All right.
20392,Raj,Hello.
20393,Howard,You own the damn thing. Just take a freaking sweater!
20394,Leonard,Hey how was your… what?
20395,Howard,Oh God Look at this buffet. I love America.
20396,Leonard,Hmm. I don’t care if this thing is burning out my retinas it makes me feel special. Now before we field test I think we…
20397,Raj,That’s the dynamic I’m the fun one you’re the buzzkill.
20398,Howard,Oh please we all know I’m the friend you call when you have no other options. If we were the Justice League I’d be Aquaman.
20399,Penny,Uh sweetie sweetie Dave was talking. You know I love science.
20400,Penny,Well not to steal from the Bible but turning water into wine sounds pretty good.
20401,Raj,My turn!
20402,Penny,Yeah. Wears them. Not just for Halloween.
20403,Penny,Okay guys trust me as someone who’s been to like seven proms it is never as good as you want it to be.
20404,Penny,I don’t really want to.
20405,Sheldon,All right But I’m given to understand that when you have something awkward to discuss with someone it’s more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat.
20406,Penny,All right.
20407,Sheldon,Yes. And now I can’t make any promises but that’s the sort of thing that gets a fella on the short list for the number eight friend slot.
20408,Howard,Uh heads up both of you are named Emily so we’ll call you red-headed Emily and you red-headed Emily Junior.
20409,Sheldon,Nobel. Kripke. Don’t look at my board.
20410,Raj,This is so messed up.
20411,Raj,How hot is it?
20412,Leonard,Fine.
20413,Penny,I understand.
20414,Sheldon,It’s eight o’clock in the morning in Mumbai. How can she have dinner?
20415,Sheldon,Well that is fine because I’ve decided that I won’t be joining you. I’ve realized that the most genuine way to demonstrate the remorse I feel is to let you have this weekend to yourselves.
20416,Sheldon,I know what your point is. You’re intimidated by Amy’s intellect. To that I say buck up.
20417,Sheldon,Yes well he lied.
20418,Leonard,Some what?
20420,Raj,Thank you but if I’m gonna just take advantage of my friends I might as well keep on relying on my father.
20421,Howard,No I’m mad at you. I hate myself but I’m mad at you.
20422,Sheldon,Yeah they say don’t meet your heroes. Don’t peek behind that curtain of fame and celebrity because if you do you’ll see them as they really are degenerate carnival folk.
20423,Raj,You think you’re so cool because your wife is a person?
20424,Penny,To be honest I’m surprised you cared about the wedding at all.
20425,Leonard,Boy I wish I could say no.
20426,Penny,Mm. Well we’ve loved having you around. Right sweetie? Leonard?
20427,Penny,That is the last thing I want to do.
20428,Penny,Okay I’m not talking about this with you.
20429,Penny,I’m not sick. It’s for work. There’s this doctor who refuses to see any sales reps. I’ve been trying to get in for months.
20430,Penny,I’ve got a spaghetti strainer in the kitchen.
20432,Leonard,Okay uh that’s the spirit but um let’s dial it back to a non-lethal form of vengeance.
20433,Leonard,Sheldon how do you know this stuff?
20434,Sheldon,Penny. 
20435,Leonard,But what I really am is a very smart scientist who understands the mechanics of the universe and is wearing the sexy black underwear you bought him.
20436,Penny,The whole thing froze. I don’t know what happened.
20437,Leonard,If we do get a new friend he should be a guy you can trust. A guy who has your back.
20438,Leonard,He’s irony impaired just move on.
20439,Howard,It’s not creepy. I built a Footprints on the Moon fan page Trent joined it.
20440,Sheldon,Superman would have taken his uniform to a Kandorian dry cleaner before he left the Bottle.
20441,Penny,Great.
20443,Penny,Well they have a lot in common. I mean they’re both scientists.
20444,Sheldon,Don’t.
20445,Howard,I’m counting that as foreplay.
20446,Penny,Well you’re not gonna go with them?
20447,Raj,Oh did you hear from Wil?
20448,Leonard,Or we could be omegas. They get pushed around by the alphas and the betas.
20449,Sheldon,Humorous. Now will you please present my paper to Professor Hawking?
20450,Penny,Aw I know I wasn’t into this before but I’m so glad I get to take you to your first prom.
20451,Penny,Damn it.
20452,Penny,Sheldon come in.
20453,Penny,No we just want information.
20454,Sheldon,When one gets beaten up every other day in school one of necessity develops a keen sense of hearing. Incidentally one can get beaten up in school simply by referring to oneself as one. I’m making English muffins. Would you like an English muffin?
20455,Leonard,I’m proud of you.
20456,Penny,Mm.
20457,Leonard,I don’t know what to say.
20458,Leonard,Hey buddy you still looking for a place to live?
20459,Leonard,Might be something to think about.
20460,Penny,I’m not happy.
20462,Raj,Well let’s not talk about him or whatever shenanigans he may or may not be up to. Let’s talk about you.
20463,Howard,It’s true. I like my giant iPad and my little iPad almost as much as my regular-sized iPad.
20464,Howard,Okay cool.
20465,Raj,I’ve been doing some research on strippers. One agency I spoke to said I could get us a great price if we’re flexible on age range and number of limbs.
20466,Sheldon,Who are you calling? Aaargh!
20467,Penny,Wait! How many questions are on this thing?
20468,Leonard,Hey.
20469,Sheldon,Speaking of cowboys do you know what country has not one but two cows on its flag? The tiny landlocked nation of Andorra. Oh the next classic episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags is writing itself.
20471,Howard,Emily these are my good friends Howard and Bernadette. Guys this is Emily.
20472,Howard,We need a plan. How about Operation Hammer of the Gods?
20473,Raj,Ha-ha very funny. Make fun of the foreign guy. For your information there are four times as many Indians as there are Americans so the way we say it is right.
20474,Howard,hat time should I be at your mother’s?
20475,Sheldon,Of course. Barry?
20476,Leonard,Hey Penny. We’re kind of in the middle of a crisis here.
20477,Sheldon,Ow! You hit me! I’m bleeding!
20478,Sheldon,And then she threw me out. Me her very own boyfriend. When all I’ve done is try to help humanity reach of the world we live in.
20479,Howard,Excuse me but how are we going to make any modifications without Wolowitz? Have you heard from Penny yet?
20480,Sheldon,You’re questioning my math?
20481,Raj,Wait I don’t understand. They didn’t find the element?
20482,Leonard,How did you get here in the first place?
20483,Penny,Yeah.
20484,Sheldon,Other than the lack of water how is it not?
20486,Leonard,You’re welcome.
20487,Sheldon,Is there anything I can do to cheer you up?
20488,Howard,Whatever it is I’m guessing we’re doing it wrong.
20489,Sheldon,Thank you that’s very helpful.
20490,Penny,Can this wait?
20491,Raj,You are my lady. Our parents said so. We are for all intents and purposes one hundred percent hooked up.
20492,Sheldon,You’re only saying that because you haven’t been there. I am now a hexagon in two-dimensional space and can only perceive the edges of other objects.
20493,Raj,N-n-n-nothing happened to me.
20494,Raj,Oh of course we can. Uh you girls have a good time. She said I was in charge.
20495,Sheldon,He seems all right. Although he does spend a disturbing amount of time looking at photographs of you and smelling the pillow you slept on. Oh but now that I think of it he asked me not to tell you that.
20496,Penny,Saturnalia?
20497,Penny,Yes but when you’re tall and have great cheekbones you’re doing it ironically.
20498,Sheldon,In here is every clock radio I’ve ever owned. Calculators VHS tapes. Yeah. Oh. Sporting equipment.
20499,Sheldon,Stop it!
20501,Howard,Yeah the theme will be that the greatest love a man can have is the love he has with himself.
20502,Sheldon,What do you mean wrong?
20503,Sheldon,Look at it. I feel like my mind just made a baby. And it’s beautiful. It’s not like human babies which are loud and covered in goop.
20504,Penny,That’s true. You are.
20505,Sheldon,What did they say?
20506,Leonard,Yeah I think so.
20507,Sheldon,Well my work in physics her work in neurobiology and most recently the possibility of our having a child together.
20508,Leonard,I think I’ve made my point.
20509,Sheldon,Pchew! Pchew! Pchew! Pchew!
20510,Sheldon,Howard don’t embarrass yourself the science chirps for itself. Humorous word play.
20511,Sheldon,Tell me what?
20512,Raj,Five.
20513,Penny,Hey.
20514,Sheldon,You used my toothbrush?
20515,Leonard,You know there’s no guarantee even if you have kids that you’re going to like them.
20516,Sheldon,How many of these can you make a day?
20517,Penny,It was cute.
20518,Leonard,No.
20519,Sheldon,Playing Super Mario on a poorly coded Nintendo 64 emulator.
20520,Raj,Dude I I think that’s Nathan Fillion.
20521,Raj,It’s kind of nice to talk to someone who understands what it feels like to be alone.
20522,Sheldon,Okay. But don’t get too attached to him. in two years 364 days he’s a dead man.
20523,Penny,What?
20524,Raj,It it is. It’s not just comic books. They’ve got action figures toys a Tron-themed dance party.
20525,Leonard,Okay let’s get clear on something. We’re just going to tell this guy to transfer all of your stuff back into your account and then be on our way. No one’s bat’lething anybody.
20526,Sheldon,Just click on them. Congratulations you are now a level three warrior.
20527,Raj,Eight for 28.
20528,Leonard,Top of her class Cambridge University. Licensed to practice law in three countries. And your face.
20529,Leonard,Hey. Hey we’re supposed to look through all this stuff before we throw it away in case it’s important.
20530,Leonard,Richard Feynman was a famous physicist.
20531,Sheldon,That’s just wrong.
20532,Leonard,She doesn’t like you. Um well uh you have a gall bladder to remove and I have to get in the shower and Penny has clothes to put on so…
20533,Howard,Water Demon.
20534,Leonard,Are you saying you want to get married?
20535,Leonard,I look forward to it.
20536,Sheldon,Can I respond now?
20537,Howard,Oh I have to go to the bathroom so bad.
20538,Penny,Which one?
20539,Sheldon,Seriously? He invented the Rubik’s Cube.
20540,Sheldon,Indeed. We are prepared for anything he can throw at us.  That’s new.
20541,Leonard,Ah ah.
20542,Leonard,What?
20543,Leonard,Prove it.
20544,Leonard,I’m not. And Penny’s qualities both good and bad are what make her who she is.
20545,Raj,Are you crazy?
20546,Penny,Really? In a comic book store?
20547,Raj,Uh it’s tonight but it’s first-come first-served so we should probably get there early and wait in line.
20548,Sheldon,Penny I am going to tell you a story that I’ve never told anyone.
20549,Penny,Yes.
20550,Penny,B-Before I do it if you’re a cop you have tell me right?
20551,Howard,Oh I think we’re doing just fine thank you.
20552,Penny,Then what difference does it make?
20553,Sheldon,So your project is more important than mine?
20554,Leonard,Nope just just whoa.
20555,Leonard,Who you talking to?
20556,Leonard,Man I cannot catch a break.
20557,Penny,Okay here’s my question. Didn’t you already do that?
20558,Penny,Sheldon says you’re going to the North Pole.
20559,Raj,I hear what you’re saying but I’ve known Emily a long time and I think she deserves the benefit of the doubt.
20560,Raj,Oh great now I can say things like I can’t believe you’re breaking up with me why are you breaking up with me? Yes I’ll still help you move.
20561,Sheldon,Oh please. Every time the topic of change comes up you throw Zachary Quinto in my face. I’m upset the mailman has a new haircut Zachary Quinto. I’m upset that daylight saving time started Zachary Quinto. I’m upset daylight saving time ended Zachary Quinto. I’m saying this for the last time Zachary Quinto was a weird wonderful unrepeatable event. So stop using him against me.
20562,Leonard,I don’t think Amy was eaten by a bobcat.
20563,Howard,All right. You’ve paid for a sweater and you’re in Sheldon Square.
20564,Sheldon,Do you want to catch up on some Walking Dead?
20565,Leonard,Well uh first of all don’t underestimate the value of discomfort.
20567,Leonard,Well then I’m putting sex back on the table. What do you think about that?
20568,Sheldon,And that’s the kind of sloppy costuming which results from a lack of rules and competition.
20569,Sheldon,Wu-wu what? That’s what I called you till I got to know you better.
20570,Leonard,Sheldon you’re talking like a crazy person.
20571,Raj,Buzz Lightyear is not real.
20572,Leonard,Fine bring us three orders of dumplings that’s twelve we’ll each have four.
20573,Sheldon,No thank you but for the record I’m an excellent dancer. Proficient in the rumba waltz and cha-cha.
20574,Penny,Well there will be boys and there will be girls and it is a party. So it’ll just be a bunch of my friends we’ll have some beer do a little dancing…
20575,Sheldon,I’m sorry. I’m just distracted by something that happened over at Penny’s.
20576,Sheldon,What’s going on? How’d I get here?
20577,Raj,I can’t compete with that. Bye.
20578,Raj,Huh. All this time I never knew there were steam tunnels down here.
20579,Penny,Hi.
20580,Leonard,What are you doing?
20581,Leonard,Thank you so much. See? Maybe honesty is the best… What are you doing?
20582,Raj,Flip a coin. You got a fifty-fifty shot.
20583,Penny,Um I think so. Why?
20584,Raj,Thank you. Oh and I’d like for at least one of us to see some action so if you guys happen to have sex it’s cool if she stays in the room.
20585,Penny,Leonard are you asleep?
20586,Leonard,You want to talk about endless patience? Penny made me watch all five seasons of Sex and the City.
20587,Howard,Where did my life go Penny? One day I’m a carefree batchelor and the next I’m married and driving a minivan to peewee cricket matches in suburban New Delhi.
20588,Penny,Uh I don’t think any of your comfort zones are showing.
20589,Penny,I’m trying to figure it out.
20590,Sheldon,Mm. If it makes you feel any better a parasitoid wasp known as Oobius depressus has been rediscovered after 101 years of presumed extinction.
20591,Raj,Really ten miles? You’re orbiting inside the atmosphere? Moron.
20592,Penny,Oh nice.
20594,Raj,No p-please don’t.
20595,Raj,Uh Lucy has some uh social anxiety issues. Maybe we could start with something simpler.
20596,Sheldon,Subtextually of course.  Morning Penny.
20597,Sheldon,Football or chicken-fried meats?
20598,Leonard,Uh-huh. Look. Mrs. Fiona Fondell from Huntsville Alabama has ordered two.
20599,Sheldon,Of course you’re fine. Not every member of a species finds a mate. Sir Isaac Newton died a virgin look at the contributions he made.
20600,Sheldon,Tell him about our IQ.
20601,Sheldon,Oh well we decided to use our breakfast time to expand our respective knowledge bases.
20602,Howard,We’re sorry Amy didn’t want to go.
20603,Howard,You went to Emily’s to apologise and when you left she was crying.
20604,Penny,Are you serious?
20605,Howard,Hang on I can see every place you went.
20606,Sheldon,Oh and how do you think you’re going to get me to do that?
20607,Leonard,So you see what you’re eating is not technically yoghurt because it doesn’t have enough live acidophilus cultures. It’s really just iced milk with carragenin added for thickness.
20608,Sheldon,You would do that?
20609,Sheldon,Professor Rothman. This isn’t your office any more. You’re retired.
20610,Leonard,What?
20611,Leonard,Oh oh no no. It’s because I spent all afternoon at the Armenian church where his funeral mass was held. According to Father Solakian no one attended. Luckily my trip wasn’t a complete waste. I lit a candle and prayed for your death but I’m not Armenian so it probably won’t work. This is over right?
20613,Leonard,Well tell your genitals what I do with Penny is none of their business.
20614,Leonard,Howard’s at the Mars Rover lab. He says he’s in trouble. Defcon 5.
20615,Howard,So uh who’s in?
20616,Penny,Yeah yeah. I was a little surprised when you decided to beat-box.
20617,Sheldon,Well I’m done with work so… ugh!
20618,Leonard,In a minute. I don’t understand why any success you have in acting is more important than any I have in science.
20620,Howard,Well let’s not talk about him or whatever shenanigans he may or may not be up to. Let’s talk about you.
20621,Howard,Come on a medium-sized asteroid is still an interesting discovery.
20622,Leonard,Oh wait. Hang on. Are you upset?
20623,Howard,All right let’s get this over with. Ew it’s got someone’s hair on it.
20624,Raj,Sheldon is a very smart man and he obviously wants to keep this a secret.
20625,Leonard,Dig deep like when we bet you couldn’t fit into Howard’s pants.
20626,Raj,I’m heckling you. It’s a beloved part of baseball.
20627,Penny,I have a confession to make.
20628,Penny,Yeah I watched. It was like the scary boat tunnel in Willy Wonka.
20629,Sheldon,Not now.
20630,Raj,I had pee his pants.
20631,Howard,And it was Gandhi who said live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.
20632,Sheldon,All right then. The reason you’re fixated on a good-natured simpleton like Penny is that she’s the exact opposite of your first romantic attachment your brilliant yet intimidating mother.
20633,Raj,You can’t make me feel bad.
20634,Raj,What’s this?
20635,Sheldon,I don’t know I’m smart and scrappy I think I’d find a way.
20636,Penny,I have no idea. That is weird.
20637,Sheldon,She was listening through the door. She wants me.
20638,Sheldon,I was working with luminous fish and I thought hey loom! Mom what are you doing here?
20639,Sheldon,Silence! How much longer must I wait for my revenge?
20640,Leonard,He actually got pretty good. He made us all matching serapes.
20641,Leonard,Oh uh yeah I was trying to see if I could laugh as a woman.
20642,Leonard,Oh. So you chose that when you become turned on you turn into Speedy Gonzalez?
20643,Sheldon,No I can’t figure out the math. I’ve been racking my brain for days and I’ve got nothing.
20644,Leonard,That is not what I said.
20645,Sheldon,That makes Halle Berry my fifth favourite catwoman. There’s Julie Newmar Michelle Pfieffer Eartha Kitt Lee Meriwether…
20646,Penny,It is; it truly is.
20647,Sheldon,No and I’m confused. It’s been nearly 24 hours. Amy should have figured out she’s wrong by now.
20648,Penny,Roommate? You guys are living together?
20649,Penny,Wow you’re really good at this.
20650,Leonard,Keep an eye on those expiration dates I’ve been burned more than once.
20651,Penny,Howard if you want my help I’ve got to know what happened.
20652,Leonard,Do you know she never let me celebrate my birthday because being born was her achievement not mine?
20653,Penny,There’s gonna be a test?
20654,Raj,How could you say that?
20655,Raj,Hey. Thanks for coming by.
20656,Leonard,he walls stop. You’re safe.
20657,Leonard,I hadn’t really given it much thought.
20658,Leonard,Yeah.
20659,Howard,There are no Jewish hobbits.
20660,Penny,No. Come on you’re supposed to say of course he misses you the only reason he’s partying is to cover up his pain.
20661,Leonard,No. Look this has to stop.
20662,Leonard,Just get a hamburger you like hamburgers.
20663,Penny,Oh.
20664,Raj,Here we go House of a 1000 Corpses.
20666,Leonard,You know there’s nothing wrong helping some woman’s kid get through their S.A.T.’s.
20667,Penny,Of course I did. It’s you.
20668,Sheldon,Leonard I’ve been working on an opening joke for our lecture at Berkeley.
20669,Howard,Prepare your uterus for his gigantic offspring?
20670,Sheldon,Uh can’t complain. Thanks for asking. Well what were you doing out at three o’clock in the morning?
20671,Penny,Hey.
20672,Raj,Why? You never thought you’d end up in a relationship and then you met Amy. Maybe there’s someone else out there for you.
20673,Penny,Fine whatever. Are you finished?
20674,Sheldon,How do I know you’re not saying that as part of the manipulation?
20675,Penny,Yeah and cap sleeves? U-u-uh.
20676,Raj,That’s okay I’m fine.
20677,Penny,Yeah I know tell me about it.
20678,Howard,Howard wanted to write mumbo jumbo but I said no our Sheldon would say hokum.
20679,Leonard,No.
20680,Raj,Born in New Delhi the third son of an itinerant gynecologist I showed early signs of genius. At the age of five I discovered a celestial object which later turned out to be the moon.
20681,Leonard,I got a triple-word score with a double letter Q. If that’s not a time to bust out the scrabble dance what’s the point of having one? Hey Barry Kripke started a fencing club.
20682,Sheldon,Oh good grief. She is such a stickler for citing sources. Those were Amy’s words.
20683,Sheldon,Quantum physics makes me so happy.
20684,Raj,In my fanny pack.
20685,Penny,Okay Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is an American classic.
20686,Leonard,Sure. You want to see what all the scientists are wearing this year.
20687,Leonard,Are you crazy? You can’t put that on Snapchat.
20688,Leonard,No I went down the stairs too fast.
20689,Raj,Any news on your co-worker who’s in the hospital?
20690,Raj,But I was summing up.
20691,Howard,But half-man half-owl could fly…
20692,Raj,Oh she’s here.
20693,Sheldon,Victory!
20695,Leonard,Yes and you’ve never met one of them.
20696,Sheldon,And I want you to know that I mean it you know? This isn’t me just wanting to go on the trip to Las Vegas.
20697,Leonard,You know he can be a lot of trouble but when I see him lying here asleep like this I just think how easy it would be to hold a pillow over his face.
20698,Raj,Well I don’t know if you realize this but I bought that crib.
20699,Leonard,Wait a minute. You talked to Penny about our sex life?
20700,Penny,Wait. Why don’t you guys stay across the hall and we will live here?
20701,Leonard,Yes
20702,Leonard,Well I’m off to meet Bernadette’s friend. How do I look?
20703,Leonard,Sorry. Does Sheldon know you’re sleeping in here?
20704,Sheldon,It amazes me how you constantly obsess over fictional details when there are more important things in the real world to worry about. For example why wasn’t William Shatner in the new Star Trek movie?
20705,Sheldon,Surprisingly well.
20706,Sheldon,We got an eight-point-two. Trust me you’re happy.
20707,Penny,Amy what’s wrong?
20708,Sheldon,That kind of stinks? Why aren’t you more upset? Did I soften the blow too much? Because this here is more like a Picasso painting.
20709,Leonard,I’m not leaving your world. I’m just talking about living across the hall.
20710,Sheldon,Wait. I’m confused. Why would you need both a robot girlfriend and a robot prostitute?
20711,Penny,Let’s slide over to Sheldon’s spot a make out.
20712,Leonard,Wow. Well done.
20713,Penny,Nope.
20714,Leonard,So what do you say?
20715,Sheldon,Melted snowmen? Are there carrots and lumps of coal in the water?
20716,Penny,See that’s the kind of passion I didn’t think I had. But then I realized I’m passionate about you.
20717,Leonard,I can do that. Uh uh from now on this mouth you and food that’s it.
20719,Penny,That’s hot. You kids better use protection.
20720,Howard,What’s the matter.
20721,Sheldon,Oh I understand the confusion. I have never said that you are not good at what you do. It’s just that what you do is not worth doing.
20722,Raj,Ooh somebody’s been taking bitchy pills.
20723,Leonard,Got it got it. We can do all kinds of stuff from the waist up you know?
20724,Howard,Oh you want to bet? You never exercise.
20725,Sheldon,Oh I’m sure you and Leonard will be able to pull it off.  Oh. It’s my friend Amy. Hello.
20726,Leonard,You okay? You seem a little distracted.
20728,Sheldon,No because we don’t celebrate the ancient pagan festival of Saturnalia.
20729,Howard,Sounds great!
20730,Penny,Thanks to overcrowding yeah.
20731,Sheldon,Well tomorrow’s Saturday. Saturday night is laundry night so I’ll be spending the preevning pre-sorting and pre-soaking.
20732,Penny,And you know what the best part is? We took our time. I mean we met we were friends for a couple years then we got together and then we got untogether then we worked out all our problems and now we know everything about each other we can just go forward with no surprises and no regrets.
20733,Leonard,That’s not what I was going to tell you.
20734,Penny,Okay here we go. Now everyone can see. All right. Where do we stand on cross-eyed Mike?
20735,Sheldon,I needed a place to fire ceramic semi-conductor substrates for home-made integrated circuits.
20736,Raj,Yes.
20737,Penny,Why? Is it about you and Sheldon?
20738,Penny,I mean the whole experience reminded me about how much I hated about that world. You you know the anxiety the depression the negativity. I don’t want to feel those things. I want to sell drugs to people who feel those things.
20739,Howard,Well okay you’re a you’re a talented artist you own your own business.
20740,Penny,Hey.
20741,Sheldon,No I will be Uncle Dr. Cooper.
20742,Penny,Okay. You want to come with me?
20743,Raj,Just a sec. Oh who says just a sec? I hate myself. Hello.
20745,Leonard,Because I am tired of him always getting his way. We don’t need a stupid meeting. We don’t even need a roommate agreement and I hope that sandwich does cause a party.
20746,Howard,You know what’s a great app? The one that makes fart noises.
20747,Leonard,When’s the screening?
20748,Sheldon,Hello.
20749,Howard,Congrats.
20750,Leonard,Call you back. Hey.
20751,Howard,I’ll do it.
20752,Penny,So we’re about to shoot this scene in the movie where the killer ape DNA is slowly taking over my body.
20753,Penny,Yeah. Sounds like me. Come on Sheldon. What do you say?
20754,Penny,Wow. That’s like the worst country song ever. So how are you doing?
20755,Sheldon,I believe in knowing my enemy Leonard. Had Twitter existed at the time would not General Custer have followed the tweets of Sitting Bull? Would not Lee have followed Grant? Would not Spy have followed Spy? I have more examples but excuse me.  Hello. Well this seems like an odd time to test my cell phone quality but go on. Test phrases? All right. Imatote. Ulbu. Twad. All together? I’m a total buttwad. Why are you laughing? Hello?
20756,Leonard,What? No it’s okay. We don’t have to talk ’cause there’s nothing to talk about. Everything’s good.
20757,Leonard,And that’s how it’s done.
20758,Leonard,Penny’s up.
20759,Raj,Yeah we’re coming for you Todd Zarnecki. And for the record Legoland is more interactive.
20760,Leonard,Well we had a vote. Three of us voted for airplane Sheldon voted for train so we’re taking the train.
20761,Howard,Our pleasure.
20762,Leonard,Your house?
20763,Leonard,Oh Sheldon I’m sure it’s not because they don’t think you’re an elite scientist.
20764,Sheldon,Oh it’s car air freshener. I was simulating the smell of the forest.
20765,Leonard,I don’t think the strippers prepare the meal but okay. Look it’s not how I pictured it either but I’m still glad we’re doing it.
20766,Sheldon,Leonard told me what happened so I took it upon myself to make you a hot beverage.
20767,Howard,What is wrong with you?
20769,Leonard,I think this could be good for you. Maybe it’s time for you to shake things up a bit.
20770,Leonard,Okay. Where were we?
20771,Sheldon,Yes but they have no Icee machines. Despite my aggressive letter-writing campaign I might add.
20772,Penny,No?
20773,Sheldon,Oops.
20774,Howard,It’s my fault. I asked Penny to do yoga with me.
20775,Raj,It’s a good thing.
20776,Howard,Oh no!
20777,Leonard,Sheldon are you worried about your safety.
20778,Howard,No screw that noise I’m going in. Hang on Santa I’m coming for you.
20779,Leonard,Careful I saw this on Star Trek. Smoke’s gonna come out of his ears soon. Hey.
20780,Raj,Well it was fun. I used some of the jewellery techniques you taught us. It’s a lightsabre belt buckle.
20781,Sheldon,No-one ever thinks it will happen until it does.
20782,Leonard,Oh right.
20783,Sheldon,That’s no threat. My mother’s always wanted a grandchild.
20784,Howard,Sheldon dinner!
20785,Leonard,John and Yoko.
20786,Sheldon,Mm. Tough decision. There’s no weaponry from Lord of the Rings forged in a Chinese sweatshop?
20788,Sheldon,And in that future are we on the same planet? Because I’ve seen people make the long-distance thing work.
20789,Leonard,Yeah okay I see him. It looks like they’re having a nice time. I wish I could hear what they’re saying.
20790,Penny,Well I went in there a few weeks ago when you guys weren’t home and I forgot it there.
20791,Raj,Great everyone’s a Byomkesh Bakshi. Now here are some secret facts about each of you including whether you are the murderer. Throughout the game feel free to ask each other questions to uncover clues.
20792,Penny,Yeah I think it’s great you guys want to get more exercise but do you really think sports is the right choice for you?
20793,Leonard,Cooper and his team?
20794,Penny,Okay well you’re a grown woman now.
20795,Sheldon,Now isn’t there something you’d like to say to me?
20796,Sheldon,Oh I haven’t asked it yet.
20797,Howard,Well no no. I I didn’t want to mislead you after you asked me out.
20798,Sheldon,I didn’t even get to that part.
20799,Leonard,I tried but  he made a fairly well-reasoned argument.
20800,Sheldon,Cinnamon toast?
20801,Sheldon,We hang on you’re my enemy. Now the enemy of the enemy is my friend. And right now I’m my own worst enemy. That makes you my friend. Okay I’m good to go.
20802,Howard,You know I’m growing to like American football.
20803,Leonard,The toys were holding hands in a furnace. Look Arthur lived a full life. And he inspired a lot of people. Sure he he was my childhood hero but the fact that I got to work with him side by side before he died was it was it was a gift.
20804,Penny,No you just suck at teaching.
20805,Raj,Oh my God I just got it. Fun onions Funyuns. Hold on. Is that a wobble? Yes. That’s definitely a gravitational wobble.
20806,Penny,Damn I forgot to feed him. And that I had him.
20807,Penny,You know there was a time I would say what’s a soup sack? But I’m glad we’re past that.  You know there was a time I would say God bless you and then you would say if you must invoke an imaginary deity how about Thor? And I would say how do you know I didn’t mean Thor? And then you would say Touché and that there ends the tale of why I no longer say
20808,Sheldon,It’s not that big of an opportunity. And even if Hawking’s theories are correct all they prove is where the universe came from why everything exists and what its ultimate end will be. I mean me? I’m interested in the big questions.
20809,Sheldon,Well conversations that you wouldn’t be comfortable having in front of the opposite sex. You know who has the best cervix. Which sanitary napkin is all the rage right now. Men’s buttocks and how you want to pat and squeeze them.
20810,Penny,Well it was kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing.
20811,Sheldon,At our committee meeting Amy made a motion for a picnic in a park but I tacked so many amendments on that thing it sank like a lead balloon.
20812,Leonard,Well you’re a friend and you like Batman and cookies and you’re off the team.
20813,Raj,And nobody drew a penis on his forehead.
20814,Penny,You’re only hearing that because I cannot roll my eyes any louder.
20815,Sheldon,You can’t cook and you made me this.
20816,Leonard,Suppose there are worse ways to spend a Friday night. None come to mind.
20817,Sheldon,Wait. Don’t you want to go through it to make sure I haven’t forgotten anything?
20818,Leonard,Don’t worry we won’t be doing much sleeping anyway. It’s like an all-night party. There’s trivia contests and Dungeons & Dragons. As we like to say it’s off the chain mail.
20819,Sheldon,Exactly. Now I am not saying that I should be the sole decider of who you mate with. If you’re not attracted to the suitor then the likelihood of conception would be reduced.
20820,Sheldon,The average cork speed is 25 miles per hour. If that is too fast around a school it is certainly too fast around a kitchen.
20821,Leonard,Why would he call me?
20823,Leonard,Who is he?
20824,Penny,Hah yeah! Because he didn’t want Sheldon to be embarrassed and there is nothing to be embarrassed okay every family in America has a relative holed up in a garage somewhere huffing paint thinner.
20825,Raj,It’s true. I like my giant iPad and my little iPad almost as much as my regular-sized iPad.
20826,Penny,No I’m dry. You’re a big crybaby you start I’ll join in.
20827,Sheldon,No I sat and I sat but to no avail.
20828,Leonard,Whatcha doin’ there? Working on a new plan to catch the roadrunner?
20829,Howard,That’s actually not a bad idea. Maybe I could even get them all together sort of like a a focus group to find out what’s wrong with me.
20830,Raj,Okay.
20831,Sheldon,Wait hold on. Before we get to the courthouse I’d like to call on your skills as an actress.
20832,Sheldon,Just a few more signatures and we’ll be finished. Initial here to acknowledge that you’ve returned your key. Okay. As my future neighbour I’d like you to have a key. Initial here to acknowledge you received it.
20833,Penny,Oh honey I’m sorry.
20834,Penny,Honey she’s upset. You’re her boyfriend. You have to at least try to be excited by the things she’s excited by.
20835,Sheldon,What do I say? I say you people need to stop ruining my mom’s visit with your sushi and your sadness and your slutty shirts. Stop it.
20836,Sheldon,And how difficult it is to do when she’s bloated cranky and crampy? Continue.
20837,Raj,It is and not a lot of comics have a woman with wings breastfeeding a baby right on the cover.
20838,Sheldon,At our age why don’t we call it man’s night?
20839,Howard,Sorry? That’s all you can say is sorry?
20840,Sheldon,Would you like to talk about it?
20841,Penny,Oh good for you.
20842,Penny,Is there anything in there about if one of you gets a girlfriend?
20843,Howard,Doesn’t count.
20844,Sheldon,Oh dear Lord they re-did the menu.
20845,Penny,What ring?
20846,Leonard,I love the way you say I’d love that.
20847,Leonard,Well I’m a pretty smart guy and right now my brain has dibs on the blood supply so give it a go.
20848,Raj,Just making conversation. Mummy daddy I want you to meet my new squeeze Penny.
20849,Sheldon,All right. Enjoy the neurobiology conference.
20850,Howard,It’s the atomic number for technetium.
20851,Sheldon,Well I suppose…
20852,Leonard,You want to hear something weird?
20853,Sheldon,Well that’s it then. I’m dead.
20854,Leonard,Yeah poor us.
20855,Raj,It’s a great deal. We both get our parents off our backs. I don’t have to come home to an empty apartment every night plus once I’m married I can finally eat carbs again and let myself go.
20856,Sheldon,I saw that.
20857,Penny,Really? You’re a genius and that’s the first thing you come up with?
20858,Raj,Hey you know that beautiful actress who plays the Borg Queen in First Contact?
20859,Penny,Oh try again.
20860,Leonard,Okay but earlier it seemed like…
20861,Raj,Oh come on. You deserve one. You’ve worked hard to find a woman who makes a lot of money.
20862,Leonard,Yeah that’s not it. Stuart’s kind of interested in Amy.
20863,Leonard,So I’m like a bran muffin.
20864,Raj,Oy.
20866,Leonard,I don’t know.
20867,Penny,No.
20868,Sheldon,Unacceptable. It baffles me why they don’t simply let some of you go so that there’s money available for my research.
20869,Sheldon,Smart. Get paid up front. Yeah I think you have a real knack for gigolo work Leonard.
20870,Sheldon,To a hospital? Full of sick people? Oh I don’t think so.
20871,Sheldon,But I suppose it wouldn’t hurt to know who’s on the committee. Let’s see. Oh Janine Davis. Oh dear.
20872,Howard,Five four three two one. That’s too bad.
20873,Leonard,So we won’t let it get weird.
20874,Leonard,Hey.
20876,Sheldon,Well the equation balances but it’s certainly not elegant.
20877,Leonard,We’ll miss you Sheldon.
20878,Leonard,You believe this guy? He has to be the best at everything.
20879,Sheldon,I was playing Got Your Nose. That’s how you get children to like you.
20880,Penny,Did you guys do it?
20881,Howard,I don’t know. I mean she’s lonely. He needs a place to stay. I doubt there’s any funny business going on. And even if there was who cares? They’re both adults.
20882,Leonard,You really should.
20883,Penny,What?
20884,Penny,There’s a girl at the Cheesecake Factory I can set you up with.
20885,Leonard,I’m glad you decided to stay. It’s gonna be special for Penny and me to share this with you.
20886,Sheldon,You know I’d love to but um I’m too busy falling back in love with Windows 98.
20887,Howard,Stop it. You’re ruining girls’ night.
20888,Howard,What you don’t say thank you?
20889,Sheldon,Are you listening to yourself it is well established that Superman’s flight is a feat of strength it is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings an ability he derives from Earth’s yellow Sun.
20890,Sheldon,Off the top of my head? Uh prospective women weed themselves out in a battle of wits until only one champion remains and she shows up at my door flush with the thrill of victory and then sits quietly by my side while I watch Daredevil.
20891,Sheldon,You can’t make a half-sandwich. If it’s not half of a whole sandwich it’s just a small sandwich.
20892,Penny,Hi.
20893,Howard,Thanks for inviting us over.
20894,Leonard,Okay fine. Sheldon may I please visit your fort?
20895,Sheldon,Anime?
20896,Howard,If you’re really a prostitute.
20897,Sheldon,Since when do you help out Barry Kripke?
20898,Leonard,Not bad. I had a lot more fun with Amy than I thought I would.
20899,Raj,Excuse me Bernadette. I have to hear it from him.
20901,Raj,That sounds really cool.
20902,Leonard,They weren’t boobies they were muscles. And the make-up was green. I was pretending to be The Hulk.
20903,Howard,What’s this?
20904,Leonard,All right fine. Hey can you think of a reason I shouldn’t invite Amy to come with me?
20905,Sheldon,Well actually I…
20906,Penny,And that made her angry?
20907,Sheldon,If you like raisins.
20908,Raj,Oh Howard I’ve got a party to plan. Don’t make me pull it out of you.
20909,Sheldon,You tell me. Dear Esteemed Colleagues as you may know I have requested to change my field of study. My decision to do so is I believe in the best interest of science. At your convenience I’d be happy to explain it to you in words you’ll understand.
20910,Penny,What’s two to one?
20911,Leonard,Uh I was out.
20912,Sheldon,A valid point but unoriginal. B-minus.
20913,Sheldon,This would go a lot faster if you put your trade school diploma to work and helped me set up this high frequency tone generator.
20914,Howard,I was distracted. It’s weird seeing a member of the Night’s Watch with a kayak strapped to his car. Come on. Hi excuse me s sorry I I don’t mean to bother you but we’re just really big fans of Firefly. And Dr. Horrible.
20915,Leonard,Yes but it’ll be Valentine’s Day. We can go sightseeing and skiing and make love in front of a roaring fire in the shadow of the snowcapped Alps.
20916,Leonard,Hey you okay?
20917,Raj,What a baby.
20918,Sheldon,I will tell you what is happening. I am saving my best friend’s marriage.
20919,Leonard,Okay let’s see. Are you from a TV series?
20920,Penny,Yeah.
20921,Penny,Right gimme gimme gimme I want to kill the guard captain. .
20922,Penny,Not recently.
20923,Sheldon,Hey Thursday can’t get here soon enough. I’m taking off work to watch the original trilogy while I eat enough Star Wars cereal to choke a Wookiee.
20924,Sheldon,I see. Can I get back to you on that?
20925,Sheldon,I said stop it!
20926,Howard,Hi Amy. Can I talk to Penny?
20927,Sheldon,Well you-sa can go think that at the back of the line. No cuts no buts no coconuts.
20928,Leonard,You bought my mom’s book?
20929,Sheldon,Oh dear Lord. A man pops out for a moment to evacuate his bowels and catch up on the adventures of the Caped Crusader only to emerge and discover his apartment has been transformed into a cabaret.
20930,Penny,Mwah!
20931,Leonard,So Missy what brings you all the way from Texas?
20932,Leonard,Yeah I’ll get to it don’t nag me.
20933,Leonard,I wonder if that’s why I have such a dysfunctional relationship with Sheldon. I had a dream the other night that I was in a cave and I was nursing a baby but the baby had Sheldon’s head on it.
20934,Raj,Yeah maybe it’s a good thing if she stops babying you so much.
20935,Sheldon,Checkmate.
20936,Penny,Well how long?
20937,Leonard,How much money did he win?
20938,Sheldon,You can never be too careful. I got one last year before I went to Epcot.
20939,Sheldon,Yes. That’s how Velma and Scooby smuggled Shaggy into the old lighthouse.
20940,Sheldon,I was out raising heck with Mr. Wil Wheaton. Four hours more and we would have closed down the HomeTown Buffet.
20941,Raj,It will be. I don’t call anyone a ho and the only time I use the phrase my bitch I’m referring to you.
20942,Penny,I was just wondering if I could talk to you? It’s about Leonard.
20943,Sheldon,Nine.
20944,Howard,I’m not sure. Some sort of beta-blocker attached to a molecule extracted from the urine of cows.
20945,Raj,I’m a scientist. My ability to think is my bread and butter. I’m afraid if I take this I might lose that special unique something that makes me so successful in my field.
20946,Leonard,Oh yeah it is and you won. I I I’m I’m sorry I have to go. I don’t believe this.
20947,Sheldon,My uncle was accused of that too. It turned out to be legal in Oklahoma.
20948,Howard,What now?
20949,Sheldon,Yeah exactly. See you’re getting it.
20950,Raj,Hey uh if you guys are free tonight I heard about a spa where you soak your feet n a pool full of little fish that eat all the dead skin right off them. I don’t need to tell you in Los Angeles sandal season is year round.
20951,Sheldon,I understand your envy. This is a can’t-miss symposium. There are going to be discussions on bioorganic cellular computer devices the advancements in multi-threaded task completion plus a roundtable on the nonequilibrium Green’s function approach to the photoionization process in atoms.
20952,Sheldon,He makes a valid point.
20954,Raj,It has more food too.
20955,Leonard,I have two words for you. The first is big the other’s whoop.
20956,Sheldon,That’s one option but who has the time? But consider this the Japanese they’re doing some wonderful work with artificial intelligence now you combine that with some animatronics from the imagineers over at Disney next thing you know we’re playing Halo with a multi-lingual Abraham Lincoln.
20957,Raj,We we can totally do that.
20958,Leonard,Oh no what should we have done differently?
20959,Leonard,Soup sandwiches and emasculation just like my mom used to make.
20960,Sheldon,Gentlemen.
20961,Howard,Dude! I put that thing on my face!
20962,Raj,The gun from Hellboy?
20963,Leonard,All right do it. Call him. Let’s find out what this loser’s ever accomplished.
20964,Sheldon,Not to mention you’d have to power down on Saturdays.
20965,Sheldon,Eating a whole Altoid?
20966,Howard,Incredibly so.
20967,Penny,Well a little bird told me that you and Lesley hooked up last night.
20968,Raj,I’m from New Delhi. Maybe you should find another entomologist.
20969,Howard,Uh you have to take the pin out.
20970,Penny,Do you think quitting my job was a mistake?
20971,Penny,Wow. Didn’t even make it out of the parking lot. Uh you know what enough about Leonard. Let’s talk about you. What would you like to do while you’re here?
20972,Sheldon, Penny?
20973,Sheldon,Really? I slept great.
20974,Sheldon,Well wait. What if just this once we suspend the date night parameters and you stay later?
20975,Sheldon,You know those confounded things make me dizzy.
20976,Leonard,Got it.
20977,Leonard,Hey what are you doing here?
20978,Sheldon,Are you calling me a quitter?
20979,Penny,I’m confused did Sheldon stop giving milk?
20980,Leonard,I met this girl and she’s great. We have a lot in common.
20981,Raj,Sheldon when I said I was fine I meant I didn’t want to talk about it any more.
20982,Leonard,Oh no that’s probably not such a good idea. Civil servants have a documented propensity to you know snap.
20983,Penny,What are you talking about? We’re fine.
20984,Leonard,Really?
20985,Howard,Right now well well actually to to be completely honest I’m stopping by to see my ex-girlfriend because she’s having a tough time. But it’s not like we’re getting back together or anything.
20986,Penny,Leonard breathes on me too. It’s not a big deal.
20987,Leonard,I’m not going to do that Howard.
20988,Howard,So that’s it? Everything’s sold out?
20989,Sheldon,Don’t trample me.
20990,Penny,Yeah it’s a perfectly good word. I mean you put it in front of dokay and you really got something. All right look let’s not overreact you know? For a lot of couples it takes time to get to know each other’s rhythms. Learn what the other person wants and likes.
20991,Raj,More importantly you’ve a Darth Vader voice changer?
20992,Leonard,That was fast.
20993,Sheldon,I really have no idea. I don’t particularly excel at reading facial expressions body language…
20994,Penny,Yes yes I know that okay? I’m tired I’ve had like 18 cups of coffee. The point is if we all just pull together we can do this. Who’s with me?
20995,Sheldon,Why is Leonard softly banging his head against his bedroom door?
20996,Sheldon,Paraffin candles may contain carcinogens. Unless lung cancer is the ambiance you were going for at your dinfast. Dinfast .
20997,Howard,Ooh this could be something. forty-three is the number of calories in half a cup of fat-free yoghurt.
20998,Leonard,I have feelings for you.
20999,Howard,Uh the one at Caltech has a crazy wait list. I warned you a lot of people apply when they’re still pregnant.
21000,Sheldon,Oh my. President Siebert I don’t mean to be an alarmist but difficulty initiating a urine stream could be a symptom of benign prostatic hyperplasia. If you’re interested I can send you a link to a YouTube video that’ll show you how to perform your own rectal exam. Yeah uh helpful hint trim your nails first.
21001,Penny,Well I told people at work that she’s pregnant. She wasn’t ready for them to know.
21002,Penny,You know I could totally rock a hat like that.
21003,Sheldon,I am not flying back to Texas just so my mom can give me a hug.
21004,Raj,Hey.
21005,Sheldon,Einstein defined insanity as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. By that standard Penny is cuckoo for cocoa puffs.
21006,Sheldon, Penny.
21007,Leonard,It’s not our fault. Our dads never did anything like this with us.
21008,Sheldon,It’s okay. You know there there’s always WonderCon in Anaheim you know? That that’s just as good. Excuse me.
21009,Sheldon,It’s a time of day I invented. It better defines the ambiguous period between afternoon and evening. Preevning. I’m fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need.
21010,Raj,Hi!
21011,Leonard,Me too I missed you.
21012,Penny,Oh great. Hi I’m Penny I’ll be your waitress.
21013,Sheldon,You stop it.
21014,Penny,Okay okay so Amy’s cool Sheldon’s cool. Tell me about Leonard.
21015,Leonard,Okay fine. Where is she going to sleep?
21016,Howard,If I don’t have to boom-boom.
21017,Sheldon,I am. It is naughty to put an adverb between the word to and the verb stem.
21018,Howard,And I told you I get diaper rash.
21020,Leonard,You enjoy your mission to boldly go where no man has gone before.
21021,Howard,Hey how come I wasn’t part of this deal?
21022,Raj,Could you say that in English? I actually I never learned Hindi.
21023,Sheldon,Hey I thought of a game we can play in the car.
21024,Sheldon,Bye.
21025,Howard,It is funny when you think about it.
21026,Sheldon,You tricked me. You didn’t say one.
21027,Penny,Okay Sheldon I think you’ve made your point.
21028,Sheldon,Yeah. Well you came to the right place.
21029,Leonard,Would an adult refuse to eat his graham crackers because one of them was broken?
21030,Leonard,Where’s Penny?
21031,Penny,No! I am frustrated because I am a failure at everything and my breath smells like fly. 
21032,Sheldon,Ha. Perfect. Okay. Get this. Professor Jones told the symposium he had a new method for calculating the mass of a muon. Five times the limit of E to the upsilon as in a 
21033,Raj,Okay. Shall we? Oh my God. It’s light it’s flaky it’s buttery. You don’t need to have sex with him just eat one of these.
21034,Penny,Yeah yeah if it gets here and I’m not here tomorrow could you just sign for it and have them put it in my apartment.
21035,Penny,I’m sorry go ahead.
21036,Howard,All right. Great.
21037,Leonard,You know we have the extra bedroom and if you need it it’s yours.
21039,Leonard,Hey where have you been?
21040,Leonard,I don’t understand what you want.
21041,Sheldon,So am I. His passing makes me feel bad.
21042,Leonard,Although yours was an eye-opener.
21043,Leonard,Thank you that’s very thoughtful.
21044,Penny,Oh. Gee thanks but I’m not really in the mood.
21045,Leonard,I saw a Thai place next door.
21046,Leonard,Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.  Okay.
21047,Leonard,Who wants the last dumpling?
21048,Raj,Like to music?
21049,Sheldon,Howard which pocket watch will you be wearing for dinner on the train?
21050,Howard,All right. Shall we?
21051,Penny,No this is stuff I want you to throw out.
21052,Penny,Oh all right well I’m glad you like it. I mean I still can’t get over the fact someone just threw it away.
21053,Penny,What?
21054,Sheldon,Do you think it’s a date?
21055,Leonard,Well hum it again. Is that the SpongeBob song?
21056,Leonard,Well you picked a good one to start. Wil’s had lots of great guests. Jonathan Frakes Brent Spiner Michael Dorn Gates McFadden.
21057,Leonard,Just say it.
21058,Leonard,Oh. It’s Stuart.
21059,Leonard,Great we’ll bring you back a tee-shirt.
21060,Penny,Not relating. Go on.
21061,Penny,What is this?
21062,Sheldon,He’s not wrong. Alright and this is my office.
21063,Sheldon,Hello Amy. It’s nice to see you.
21064,Sheldon,Are you implying that my girlfriend has no sexuality to exploit?
21065,Leonard,No. No there’s nothing going on between Penny and me.
21066,Leonard,For what?
21067,Howard,No one’s arguing with you dude.
21068,Sheldon,He said they made the editorial decision to only cite the lead scientist.
21069,Sheldon,But I met with 11 people and they all walked out. And that Hollywood phoney Chris Pratt never tweeted me back.
21070,Sheldon,So I’m running out of time.
21071,Howard,Well I know how to make it special.
21072,Sheldon,Then I have a simple solution go up to the roof hop over to the next building there’s a small gap don’t look down if you’re subject to vertigo and use their stairwell.
21073,Leonard,Sheldon you are really being unreasonable.
21074,Raj,Well me neither.
21075,Penny,How you doing over there?
21076,Penny,It won’t. Let’s just promise to figure this kind of stuff out before we get married.
21077,Sheldon,It’s Halo night.
21078,Leonard,No doubt no doubt. Okay well I’m sorry it didn’t work out.
21079,Raj,Oh screw Princess Punchali.
21080,Leonard,Call me a lady part. We’ll see about that.
21081,Howard,Here let me help you.
21082,Sheldon,That’s a bit childish isn’t it?
21083,Penny,You’re damn right it’s okay. I’ve been having leftovers at the restaurant for like four days and I wanted something different. So sue me.
21084,Leonard,Yes
21085,Howard,Is it even possible to get this done in two months?
21086,Leonard,Okay how about this nobody gets to be The Flash we all change agreed?
21087,Sheldon,Not with a bowling ball on their back.
21088,Leonard,Why are you so mean to me?
21089,Leonard,No! There it went to voice mail.
21090,Leonard,What is that? What is that for?
21091,Penny,Um what?
21092,Sheldon,Half chocolate half vanilla side by side not swirled?
21093,Sheldon,That’s the beauty of it.
21094,Raj,I’d like to tell them things are going well.
21095,Sheldon,And of course you’ve already introduced yourself to Dr. Hofstadter.
21096,Penny,So what’s the deal with your apartment? Why’s it taking so long?
21097,Sheldon,Sadly yes. Amy’s taking me to a memorial service. It’s for one of her colleagues who is of Asian descent so my planned conversational gambit is to casually remark that no matter how deep they dig his grave he’ll never make his way back to China.
21098,Howard,Wait your your mother is sleeping with your dentist?
21099,Howard,Hey.
21100,Sheldon,Yes hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks!
21101,Sheldon,From the data at hand you really can’t draw that conclusion. All you can say with absolute certainty is that that joke is not funny here.
21102,Sheldon,It doesn’t?
21103,Penny,Relax Sheldon he’s only a few minutes late.
21104,Leonard,Eyes on the road. Eyes on the road!
21105,Penny,Yeah.
21106,Howard,Oh dear.
21107,Raj,Come on. When you were on TV in Firefly you were actually in space.
21108,Sheldon,Rats.
21109,Raj,Yes. I picked her up and then we both went for massages to try and calm down. And then we got Pinkberry.
21110,Leonard,You do that too?
21111,Penny,That sounds like fun.
21112,Raj,Okay then you go there.
21113,Leonard,Colonel Williams. Sir.
21114,Howard,Yes but him doesn’t even know about her.
21115,Raj,Does this place look familiar?
21116,Leonard,Uh…
21117,Howard,She is. She’s just running a little late. You know how it is girls always fussing about their hair their makeup. She’ll be here. Just give it a rest okay?
21118,Sheldon,No. I wanted to surprise her. What am I supposed to say to her after something like this?
21119,Howard,Any chance you could send me a PDF of that playbook?
21120,Penny,Wow. You poor thing.
21121,Sheldon,Freeze-dried spicy mustard?
21122,Leonard,Wait wait his wing moved.
21123,Penny,Moondance?
21124,Sheldon,He’s a homeless drug addict Leonard where is he going to go? Boy you have a lot to learn about lying.
21125,Sheldon,Can I look yet?
21126,Raj,Yeah
21127,Sheldon,Oh not necessarily. I suggest you look for long-lost relatives either in Armenia or Lebanon.
21128,Sheldon,What?
21129,Penny,I think you meant that you don’t believe in me.
21130,Penny,I’ll pretend I didn’t hear it.
21131,Leonard,Fine then tell me how I should be looking at it.
21132,Howard,Maybe but I don’t care. That’s the great thing about Nyquil it’s like ten-percent booze. I call it the nighttime sniffling sneezing coughing so you can talk to girls medicine.
21133,Sheldon,Hello female children. Allow me to inspire you with a story about a great female scientist. Polish-born French-educated Madame Curie. Co-discoverer of radioactivity she was a hero of science until her hair fell out her vomit and stool became filled with blood and she was poisoned to death by her own discovery. With a little hard work I see no reason why that can’t happen to any of you. Are we done? Can we go?
21134,Leonard,You put moths in my food?
21135,Leonard,Hey.
21136,Leonard,No I didn’t realize it had been so long. Sure I guess there’s no other choice but to just go ahead and do it.
21137,Leonard,Mahalo’s a nice touch.
21138,Raj,I don’t want to do that.
21139,Sheldon,I wanted to let you know I’ll be spending your birthday with you.
21140,Leonard,Fine I’ll do it. But not because of them because I love you.
21141,Sheldon,Um…
21142,Leonard,It’s no big deal.
21143,Leonard,Go! Go! Go! Go-Go-Go-Go! Yes! Are you people watching this? Is this amazing or what?
21144,Howard,Booya.
21145,Sheldon,Why would the Chinese make our DVR record Paul Blart Mall Cop?
21146,Sheldon,You’re going to have to learn to do these things for yourself Penny.
21147,Penny,I’m sorry daddy…
21148,Leonard,Yes I know you’re too smart for this.
21149,Leonard,Okay. Well good night.
21150,Leonard,All right it starts now.
21151,Penny,Okay. Do whatever you want.
21152,Howard,Busting you.
21153,Raj,No I’m mad at you. I hate myself but I’m mad at you.
21154,Sheldon,It’s five and a half.
21155,Penny,Alright well I’ll talk to you later but I am so happy for you Leonard.
21156,Sheldon,A man named Jesus convinced you to build a church in Africa. You’re kind of a sucker.
21157,Sheldon,I just think you need to be careful how you phrase things sir.
21158,Leonard,I’ll take a look at it.
21159,Penny,I don’t know if I want to cook for him. He’s kind of a picky eater. I mean it’s too salty it’s too dry it’s too burnt and frozen at the same time. Okay come on what else would sweep you off your feet?
21160,Penny,She seems really sweet. Believe me you do not want to take that for granted. There are a lot of bitches out there.
21161,Sheldon,Well his rent and car lease are exceedingly high. You couple that with his penchant for dining out and shopping.
21162,Raj,Me too. I’m just I’m a little on edge.
21163,Howard,Everything okay?
21164,Penny,You’re gonna be seeing each other a lot so respect each other’s personal space.
21165,Sheldon,Oh no I’m not going to drink it. I just wanted to hear the pop. Yeah I knew it was coming. Still scary.
21166,Penny,Okay I don’t think Meryl Streep ever had to say “Must keep gorilla hands from killing again!”
21167,Sheldon,You’re kidding. Shouldn’t the question be why aren’t you?
21168,Penny,Aha. Okay let’s see. To continue on your quest leave no stone unturned. Ooh.
21169,Penny,Yeah!
21170,Leonard,Yeah okay but what’s with the back-scratching and the meow!
21171,Sheldon,You realize you and I could become brothers.
21172,Leonard,Damn it. I slipped.
21173,Sheldon,Oh yes the common cold. Just like everyone else. You’d love that wouldn’t you?
21174,Penny,That’s great. Do you want some wine?
21175,Penny,All right time to open Bachelor Number Two.
21176,Sheldon,You’re not going to have Funyuns when we’re a mile below the surface of the Earth.
21177,Penny,Shrimp Caesar salad with no almonds for the highly allergic kosher-only-on-the-high-holidays Howard and for our suddenly back on the Hindu wagon Raj meatlover’s pizza no meat. Coming right up.
21178,Raj,Nothing happened. Can we please just change the subject?
21179,Sheldon,Yes. I’m using their Cray Supercomputer to analyze shuffling patterns.
21180,Penny,Yeah kind of yeah.
21181,Leonard,Ah you’re upset because you spent the whole night working on dark matter and didn’t make a breakthrough and now you’re worried you made a huge mistake switching fields and you’re gonna sit around and sulk all day?
21182,Sheldon,Close! Neeeeeoooooowwwww!
21183,Raj,I don’t think we’re going to do that.
21184,Howard,Yeah
21185,Howard,India.
21186,Leonard,The surf and turf sounds good. See if they have corn on the cob.
21187,Penny,Oh unbelievable! Know how he did it yet?
21188,Howard,Mm true. I do feel guilty about him.
21190,Leonard,It’s not a joke. It’s the real design.
21191,Penny,Oh damn it we should have brought binoculars.
21192,Penny,I swear to God Sheldon one day I’m going to get the hang of talking to you.
21193,Raj,Oh cool it tells you when someone’s reading your profile. Jenny309. I hope that’s not her weight.
21194,Leonard,What happens if she doesn’t like us?
21195,Sheldon,Yes but you’re much closer to it than he is.
21196,Leonard,Uh-oh he’s stuck in an infinite loop.
21197,Leonard,Oh the video game. Yeah that was bad.
21198,Howard,Okay uh will I get to see you tomorrow?
21199,Penny,Mm.
21200,Leonard,What?
21201,Penny,What? I was not a bully.
21202,Sheldon,Okay. Leonard even though I don’t have one any more I hope you have fun playing with it.
21203,Sheldon,Wait! What am I supposed to do?
21204,Howard,On Sesame seed Bunzillas.
21205,Sheldon,Amy I was off by a factor of 10000.
21206,Leonard,Want me to make you some tea?
21207,Raj,Sometimes I get so lonely I sit on my left hand until it goes numb then I put it in my right hand and pretend I’m holding hands with another person.
21208,Leonard,No. We cannot lose to that jerk.
21209,Leonard,Scrotum.
21210,Leonard,Then I guess we would let him back on the app team and while we’re doing that you could take an aerial tour of L.A. on your flying pig.
21211,Penny,Oh no no I want to. It sounds really interesting.
21212,Penny,It still counts. You know how is this any different from you making me live with Sheldon?
21213,Penny,Getting a little less cool Leonard.
21214,Howard,Sheldon she’s fine.
21215,Sheldon,Why hast thou forsaken me O deity whose existence I doubt?
21216,Leonard,Oh hey. You work the lunch shift?
21218,Leonard,That’s because you’ve never seen him on restock the medicine cabinet day.
21219,Sheldon,Hello.
21220,Penny,Same as all of us getting out of a car without underwear.
21221,Raj,Sheldon dinner!
21222,Raj,Uh… blackened salmon?
21223,Penny,Yello.
21224,Penny,Hey you know my mom smoked pot when she was pregnant with me and I turned out just fine. Hey look I have peach schnapps. Thank God.
21225,Leonard,What who told you that?
21226,Raj,Okay. So in the last 20 minutes we’ve seen a crazy woman kissing a fetus in a jar. We’ve seen a guy cut in half and sewn to a fish.
21227,Sheldon,Ugh Atlantic City without the taffy? No thank you.
21228,Howard,No it’s chilly outside. Didn’t bring my jacket.
21229,Raj,Howard’s capsule should be re-entering the atmosphere any minute.
21231,Penny,Here we go.
21232,Raj,Very very smart guys.
21233,Sheldon,Well you should know that she recently broke up with me.
21234,Penny,But it didn’t seem real.
21236,Sheldon,It worked. It really worked. They said I was mad but it worked. 
21237,Leonard,Who’s there?
21238,Penny,I told you if we were patient he’d figure it out for himself.
21239,Sheldon,Next.
21240,Leonard,She says take our names off the sign-in sheet and leave.
21241,Leonard,No we’re not we’re not not a couple two singles like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that…. are friends.
21242,Sheldon,Relationship agreement Section 4 Boo-boos and Ouchies. You have to take care of it.
21243,Raj,Aha.
21244,Howard,If you want to chase after her chase after her.
21245,Sheldon,I’m gonna go as Dumbledore.
21246,Penny,Look can’t you just let him play with you until bedtime?
21247,Howard,Hey.
21248,Penny,Oh my gosh that’s awful. The other kids make fun of you?
21249,Penny,Where are we going?
21250,Howard,What else?
21251,Penny,No it’s completely fine. Hmm. I get it. Sheldon sent you. He put you up to this.
21252,Raj,And worst of all Fin Fang Foom.
21253,Sheldon,Everyone will see my oddly shaped uvula.
21254,Penny,What?
21255,Penny,I know it’s hard honey but in the end that’s how you grow.
21256,Penny,Yeah jabber jabber jabber okay boys Queen Penelope’s back online.
21257,Sheldon,Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment I have awakened at 615 poured myself a bowl of cereal….
21258,Leonard,I reiterate knuckle under.
21259,Sheldon,Don’t. He’s making our case.
21260,Penny,I hope one of those people is a monkey ’cause this is bananas.
21261,Penny,In 20 years who knows what’ll happen with any of us?
21262,Raj,Now three times fast?
21263,Sheldon,Check.
21264,Sheldon,That’s not even from your franchise!
21265,Penny,All right well if I’m understanding this right and all she did was help out another scientist I’m thinking you might have to let this one go.
21266,Sheldon,What do you do?
21267,Sheldon,You’re seriously going to get in a van and let these two take you to an unknown destination for an entire weekend?
21268,Raj,Well there’s a question I better have a good answer to before she gets back.
21269,Penny,Whatever your secret is I’m sure it’s boring so I’m not interested.
21270,Sheldon,You’re darn right you wouldn’t. No matter where I am this will always be my spot. Like an embassy in a foreign country this seat is the sovereign soil of my bottom.
21271,Howard,I’m so mad at you!
21272,Leonard,I didn’t see it.
21273,Leonard,Hey.
21274,Sheldon,Our apartment was broken into our security system tried to kill me and as a result I’m leaving Pasadena forever. Tell me how that’s overreacting.
21275,Penny,I-I guess they just figured it out at some point.
21276,Leonard,Okay so we agree whenever someone takes us off topic they get their arm hair yanked off.
21277,Sheldon,Well I was. But that was before Howard explained to me how awful it would be if he had to work with his significant other.
21278,Leonard,Hey you.
21279,Howard,And I can put it in your office?
21280,Howard,I get it. What do you want to do?
21281,Sheldon,George Smoot is a Nobel Prize-winning physicist one of the great minds of our time. His work in black body form and anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation cemented our understanding of the origin of the universe.
21282,Raj,He’s coming. Screen saver.
21284,Penny,Raj I’m so sorry.
21285,Sheldon,Yoda’s swamp was in the middle of nowhere. Tatooine was in the middle of nowhere. Hoth was in the middle of nowhere. That’s code Leonard. He wants us to drop in.
21286,Howard,Holy crap. It’s like Silence of the Lambs down here.  Don’t do that!
21287,Sheldon,All right. I’m no stranger to a little gray matter. Locus coeruleus. Locus coeruleus.
21288,Leonard,So uh Priya what are your plans while you’re here.
21289,Leonard,Oh good go. You know it’ll be nice to watch an episode without someone saying I read the books don’t get too fond of this character.
21290,Leonard,No I needed to hear it.
21291,Penny,Okay just to be clear. You are asking me for help because I know something that the brilliant Dr. Sheldon Cooper doesn’t.
21292,Sheldon,How can you sleep? I’m not done making you feel better. I still have to put a cold rag on your head sing to you and apply VapoRub to your chest.
21293,Leonard,Oh that’s that’s fine. Go ahead.
21294,Penny,Yeah he does but it’s not the same.
21295,Leonard,That’s pretty cool.
21296,Sheldon,Is one of those things your fondness for orange juice?
21297,Leonard,She introduced me to her father kissed me and then shut the door in my face.
21298,Sheldon,I have pain radiating from my navel to my lower right abdomen. I’m nauseated and feverish. I believe I may have cholera.
21299,Raj,It’s only $800?
21300,Penny,All right let’s go.
21301,Sheldon,It is. You were wrong friend Howard. She completely understood.
21302,Leonard,Well our plane leaves at 9 a.m. Do you think you’ll feel better by then?
21303,Raj,Come on scissors scissors!
21304,Sheldon,Okay that’s great. Now let it go.
21305,Howard,Oh no. In this game as your careers both took off you drifted apart. Kind of like how future me lost touch with you guys after I became boy toy for the wrinkled but still flexible Madonna.
21306,Penny,Hey Arthur. How are you?
21307,Penny,If I were you I’d be worried that a girl who’s never played chess in her life just kicked your ass.
21308,Sheldon,True but Penny’s married and so is Bernadette. And your girlfriend has red hair and white skin which really rubs up against my clown phobia.
21309,Raj,Woo-hoo!
21310,Leonard,With all the TV Sheldon was talking about I had the greatest idea ever. It even blows away my idea for a Star Wars themed coffee shop called Brewbacca’s. You need to watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It is the perfect show for the two of us. It’s got action and jokes and hot vampires and romance. I cannot oversell this. What do you say?
21311,Sheldon,Libido 1 truth zero.
21312,Leonard,When she comes out with Eat Pray Run Away From A Giant Boulder I’ll read it.
21313,Sheldon,I had no idea all our relationships were such a disaster. Boy you’re good.
21314,Leonard,So I did something stupid. I’m sure you did stupid things when you were younger. What were you doing seven years ago?
21315,Penny,Yeah. I started that rumour.
21316,Leonard,Why not?
21317,Raj,Uh-oh. She wants to meet us.
21318,Sheldon,I was thinking about your experiment on the neuroscience of decision making and I realized if we connect it to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics we have a chance to disprove the role of consciousness in the Copenhagen Interpretation.
21319,Sheldon,Did you get the part?
21321,Leonard,I know.
21323,Sheldon,That just happened to me. Next time you’re stuck for a tweet feel free to say what a jerk Ira Flatow is.
21324,Leonard,Oh I don’t think so.
21325,Sheldon,Huh?
21326,Penny,No no come on. Come on you’re not gonna get fat. You’re gonna be beautiful and glowing and and have the cutest little baby bump ever.
21327,Sheldon,Better. Did Wil and Adam leave?
21328,Sheldon,There are boundaries.
21329,Leonard,How do I look?
21330,Sheldon,You and Leonard don’t have anything in common. Maybe you should break up.
21331,Sheldon,I hear a woman’s voice.
21332,Raj,Guys help me.
21333,Penny,Well you know now that we’re engaged we had some questions about how you handle money as a couple.
21334,Penny,Just…. a lot.
21335,Leonard,Are you having trouble sleeping? ‘Cause boy I was up all night.
21336,Penny,No you’re right we should do what you do. Have our mom send us pants from the Walmart in Houston.
21337,Howard,I just wanted to do something beautiful.
21338,Raj,Yeah. Uh after dinner we watched a rerun of Rockford Files and then she opened a bottle of uh cream sherry and the next thing I know she was tucking me into your bed.
21339,Raj,Can’t you just enjoy the wonder Sheldon? Why must you peek behind the curtain? Or up the butt?
21340,Leonard,Hey how did it go?
21341,Leonard,It’s also not pink and has no berries.
21342,Sheldon,It’s one of the few forms of interaction with people that I don’t find repellent.
21343,Howard,What is it papa.
21344,Leonard,I say we investigate.
21345,Sheldon,I was scared but I told myself it’s just a big bathtub. Then I got scared again ’cause there are all these strangers in my bathtub.
21346,Leonard,I’m trying. This is the best I can do. What are you doing?
21347,Leonard,When did my idea become our idea?
21348,Sheldon,When the IRS questions us in separate rooms we need to have our stories straight.
21349,Sheldon,I can think of many things Spider-Man can’t do that a spider can. One crawl in your ear and die. Two legally leave Guatemala without a passport. Three have sex with a spider.
21350,Penny,Why not?
21351,Penny,You sound funny.
21352,Sheldon,No this is for science. I can be brave for science.
21353,Sheldon,Everybody hold on. Let’s take this problem one step at a time. First we need to decide whether we’re calling it leever or lehver. And the sooner we decide it’s leever the sooner we can roll up our sleeves not slehves and get to work.
21354,Leonard,Then why did you have Chinese food with us?
21355,Leonard,Pretty cool about Howard huh?
21356,Sheldon,Just look see this first question makes no sense how many car lengths should you leave in front of you when driving? There’s no possible way to answer that a car length is not a standardized unit of measure.
21357,Leonard,Hey.
21358,Penny,How is that not good?
21359,Penny,God can we please just say no longer seeing each other?
21360,Sheldon,I didn’t say fun fact. I’m not a monster.
21361,Sheldon,Stay close to the wall. Avoid the mummies.
21362,Howard,I would love to. I do enjoy the complexity of an aged Pinot noir.
21363,Sheldon,Careful. That’s a collectible.
21364,Sheldon,Who do you think made the French toast with butter and syrup?
21365,Leonard,Okay so I I I guess I’ll just jump right in.
21366,Sheldon,Oh yeah well your attempt at juvenilizing me by excluding me from the set of adult males…. oh I’m too tired to do this.
21367,Leonard,Wait where are you going?
21368,Leonard,Penny.
21369,Sheldon,Because this changes everything. What about comic book night? Uh what about playing games together? What about our trips to Disneyland? How can we do those things with a child around?
21371,Sheldon,I’ll say.
21372,Raj,I’m sorry. What did you want to say?
21373,Leonard,When was the last time you saw her?
21374,Sheldon,Half a teaspoon of sprinkles?
21375,Sheldon,Great. See you in about half an hour.
21376,Howard,That would be lovely. Thank you.  Mrs. Wolowitz uh are you okay?
21378,Raj,You know did he say things like youse guys or listen here see?
21379,Howard,No we both have to be the same thing. Okay we’re ninjas.
21380,Howard,Well now it’s biguous. What are you gonna do about it?
21381,Leonard,What’s the idea?
21382,Howard,Why Larry? Did Larry call dibs?
21383,Raj,Hey.
21384,Sheldon,What are you all staring at? Didn’t you ever see a man try to get a meeting with Stephen Hawking before?
21385,Leonard,Sure maybe a tableau of me trying to pummel you to death.
21386,Sheldon,He said it’s why they hired me it’s it’s what my grant was designated for and that everybody has to do things they don’t want to do. He then gave an example of something he had to do even though he didn’t want to which was look at my stupid face.
21387,Leonard,What’s that?
21388,Raj,I’m sure many women in happy relationships spend their nights skyping with their ex-boyfriend Sanjay.
21389,Penny,What beverage do you make for that?
21390,Howard,I’ve been doing some research on strippers. One agency I spoke to said I could get us a great price if we’re flexible on age range and number of limbs.
21391,Raj,What?
21393,Sheldon,Control over the information contained in that letter belongs to Howard. By happenstance I came to know it. That doesn’t give me the right to disseminate it freely.
21394,Sheldon,A microphone a room full of inaccurate depictions of Polynesian religion and a captive audience to hear about it? You bet I am.
21395,Penny,Never mind. Can I stay here or not?
21396,Leonard,I saw it. It’s big.
21397,Sheldon,That is true. Well I suppose I should apologize again.
21398,Howard,And I will return to New Delhi in triumph atop a bejeweled white elephant. And you know what will be on that elephant’s back? A seat warmer. No Father you may not have a ride.
21399,Howard,There are independent voice and fingerprint scanners.
21400,Penny,You mean like a beta test?
21401,Sheldon,That was for my cushion.
21402,Howard,Great.
21403,Raj,So we tell him she’s a lesbian right?
21404,Leonard,Wait are we really going to Long Beach?
21406,Raj,Okay who had Leonard gets a floppy disk?
21407,Leonard,Oh does the gazelle know that according to Harlan Ellison it was not ripped off from Demon With a Glass Hand but was ripped off from another Outer Limits script he wrote called The Soldier?
21408,Sheldon,Oh you make me laugh sad clown. Anyhoo Leonard will be back in a couple days and I need a welcome home gift for him. As he’s been at sea perhaps something with a nautical theme might be appropriate.
21409,Penny,Yup so we brought you some lunch and we are gonna go look for ’em.
21410,Penny,Look it’s got to be around here somewhere.
21411,Howard,No. Bought this at the Staples Center when I went to see Taylor Swift.
21412,Sheldon,I hope laughter is the best medicine ’cause this care package is a joke.
21413,Penny,Ooh I got one. If you guys were a band you’d be called Leonard and the Leonards.
21414,Howard,Here we go ten and a half hours of apey goodness.
21415,Leonard,Hang on.
21416,Penny,Are you out of your mind?!
21417,Raj,No it’s time to put on some R. Kelly and suck face.
21418,Sheldon,It’s late. Got to go. Bye.
21419,Leonard,No.
21420,Leonard,And then nothing. I stopped it. But it still bothers me and I wanted you to know.
21421,Raj,What? This is not a problem okay? If you don’t want to know I don’t have to tell you.
21422,Leonard,Which is crazy since rock and roll is all about good customer service.
21423,Leonard,So did you love it? Of course you loved it. How could you not love it? Tell me how much you loved it.
21424,Sheldon,Don’t worry everyone in here is safe.
21425,Sheldon,It certainly looks okay. Has a strong toxic chemical smell. That’s reassuring.
21426,Leonard,We’re not playing. This is real work.
21427,Sheldon,No you didn’t.
21428,Penny,Emotionally.
21429,Leonard,No.
21431,Penny,All right let’s see. What’s something fun the guys would never take us to do? Oh I know we could go horseback riding.
21432,Leonard,Sheldon Canada is not going to invade California.
21433,Sheldon,Okay point. What sort of foundation do you have? Did you take any science classes in school?
21434,Howard,Can I bring girls here?
21435,Leonard,Uh if it’s yoghurt that helps ladies poop I think Raj beat you to it.
21436,Leonard,I told you my plan. Let’s call Building Services and get help.
21437,Howard,Wait wait. I I found your blog here you wrote about me.
21438,Penny,Yeah it was fun I walked in and two different guys got asthma attacks. Felt pretty good.
21439,Sheldon,I think it’s pretty obvious. They don’t want dessert ’cause they filled up on bread.
21440,Sheldon,Will that calm my nerves?
21441,Raj,Do you think I’m feminine?
21442,Sheldon,If you say so boss.
21443,Penny,Wait… what?
21444,Leonard,Look at us Sheldon. We’re the crazy people.
21445,Penny,Yeah I get that. I’ll go get you your water. When you say easier you mean easier for you right? ‘Cause it certainly didn’t make it easier for him.
21446,Raj,Please this is my way of thanking you for letting me stay here. Now tell us all about your day.
21447,Penny,You might want to pace yourself.
21448,Leonard,No no no I I looked and there’s there’s there’s no more tickets.
21449,Sheldon,Oh good you’re here. Are you still fighting? If you get divorced do I get two Christmas’s?
21450,Leonard,I thought this was gonna be boring but it’s actually kind of fun.
21451,Sheldon,Permission granted Commander.
21452,Leonard,Uh yeah yeah that sounds great.
21453,Sheldon,Yes cocoa. Do you have any idea what it’s like to be paired with someone who’s so incredibly annoying?
21454,Sheldon,If there’s ever a Church of Sheldon this will be when it started. Ow!
21455,Penny,Oh my God. What happened?
21456,Penny,Okay well thank you for getting my mail.
21457,Leonard,Fine put the Slim Jim in the garbage bag.
21458,Sheldon,Uh-huh.
21460,Penny,The Wesley Crushers?
21461,Raj,It’s too bad he wasn’t here for that hooker. She’s exactly his type. A hooker. You know I bet if we hired her that would cheer him up.
21462,Penny,I can’t believe you fit in the crib.
21463,Penny,I hate my job.
21464,Leonard,I know it’s not ideal but don’t let them ruin our night.
21465,Howard,It’s not gonna work dude I grew up in India an entire subcontinent where cows walk in the street and nobody has ever had a solid bowel movement.
21466,Penny,No.
21467,Raj,Say hello to an exact scale model of me. Oh I’m not dark chocolate. I’m melt-in-your-mouth caramel.
21468,Leonard,One two three.
21469,Sheldon,Nine years 11 months and three weeks ago he followed that up by replacing the slides for my lecture with photographs of nude fat women bending over.
21470,Sheldon,Do you have allergies?
21471,Leonard,Oh no. Seriously?
21472,Sheldon,Yeah once again I know.
21473,Penny,Wait meet them.
21474,Penny,Okay let’s do it. You gonna make it?
21475,Penny,Yeah go ahead and make jokes but your thirties are almost over.
21476,Leonard,And tipping his hat to the cleaning lady didn’t do that?
21477,Raj,So what do you gals do?
21478,Leonard,Look do I think that you are talented and that you are beautiful? Of course I do. But isn’t Los Angeles full of actresses who are just as talented just as beautiful? All right look we’ll come back to that.
21479,Sheldon,Coping with the death of a loved one. My condolences.
21480,Sheldon,Thank you.
21481,Penny,Nice to finally meet you too.
21482,Sheldon,He left a boy he returns a boy-sized hero.
21483,Penny,Well let’s go find out who.
21484,Raj,What? You’ve kissed like once in three years.
21485,Sheldon,I’m prepared to say I love it as soon as I confirm there are no hobos aboard.
21486,Leonard,Hey.
21487,Howard,You can’t wear the hands on the date.
21488,Howard,No.
21489,Sheldon,Hoo!
21490,Sheldon,I’ll tell you exactly how he did. Readiness unsatisfactory. Follows direction barely. Attitude a little too much. Overall not only will he probably die in a fiery inferno his incessant whining would most certainly spoil everyone else’s day.
21491,Penny,Okay he just showed up at my door. Don’t you think that’s a little weird?
21492,Raj,He lives with Leonard.
21493,Sheldon,A little bit? The man Super Glued Hershey’s Kisses to your nipples.
21494,Leonard,Yeah uh um Penny and I got married.
21495,Penny,What? You tell me about your foot fungus but this is a secret?
21496,Penny,What is this my first day?
21497,Leonard,Then what is it?
21498,Sheldon,Look I’m sorry when did you even get here? I…
21499,Penny,Yeah no no no. You know what Sheldon it’s okay. You don’t have to go into the bathroom.
21500,Howard,Okay I’ll be a badass but only if you pinky-swear to be one too.
21501,Penny,All right well what have you tried so far?
21502,Penny,You can’t do that. He’s with me.
21503,Sheldon,There you go again nag nag nag. You’re only proving my point little lady.
21504,Raj,Maybe I can go with you guys to Houston?
21505,Leonard,You’re right all sex has is nudity orgasms and human contact.
21506,Howard,Excuse me I think how could you she’s my sister takes precedence over a five year old pinky swear!
21507,Howard,Anyway thanks again.
21508,Sheldon,My mistake. Now assuming the left side of a bell curve peaking around the present that would bring the total up to 193 men. Plus or minus eight men.
21509,Leonard,Golden age green lantern was vulnerable to wood.
21510,Howard,I’m listening.
21511,Raj,Hey uh Sheldon you want anything?
21512,Sheldon, No you don’t screw the roommate agreement. The roommate agreement screws you.
21513,Sheldon,Hello Leonard. Oh hello Arthur. What an odd coincidence that you’re both here.
21514,Penny,Oh that’s nice.
21515,Leonard,For what?
21516,Leonard,Yeah thanks but nobody asked you.
21517,Sheldon,Of course you do. It’s about you like everything else.  Oh thank goodness. I don’t think I had it in me to make another glass of water.
21518,Sheldon,So trick her.
21519,Leonard,You went with Thor?
21520,Howard,No no no. Hey you should totally get it. In fact I’ll buy it for you.
21521,Raj,Oh my God you’re back. Oh look at you. You you look like you grew.
21522,Sheldon,All right fine. Let’s say that we were to entertain people. What type of gathering did you have in mind? Huh? A meal? Lunch? Brunch? Dinner? Afternoon tea? A formal tea? Hmm? Is it a party? And if so what kind of party? Is it a cocktail party? A Tupperware party? Ooh is it a surprise party? Oh I hope it’s not a West Coast party ’cause according to the man on the radio a West Coast party don’t stop.
21523,Sheldon,It’s Penny’s bedroom. Plenty of men have gone before.
21524,Sheldon,Dibs? This is a university not a playground. Offices are not assigned because someone called dibs.
21525,Penny,Okay look I know Amy’s like an old lady but she’s not old enough to have a song from the sixties written about her.
21526,Leonard,Yeah I think I would.
21527,Leonard,Can we please just stop talking about it?
21528,Howard,Thanks again for letting me crash girls’ night.
21529,Howard,No no no no I think it just means it’s the kind of sauce that mobsters like.
21530,Leonard,He’s been in bed for two days.
21531,Leonard,Hey.
21532,Sheldon,But to be fair when you talk most of what you say sounds like wah wah wah clothes wah wah wah.
21533,Sheldon,Howard doesn’t. He’s only an engineer.
21534,Raj,Guys she’s my goddaughter I think I’ll know when I see her. That one.
21535,Leonard,Oh rose petals.
21536,Sheldon,All right this is a Google Earth view of the field of battle.
21537,Howard,No it’s just ever since I started dating Claire and Emily at the same time it’s exhausting.
21538,Howard,I always thought Peppermint Patty was a lesbian?
21539,Penny,Yeah.
21540,Leonard,That’s not helpful. It’s fun to think about but it’s not helpful. Hey Sheldon we are on a serious time crunch. We can’t do this without you. Can you please pull it together?
21541,Howard,Hey guys I’m trying to cook in here.
21542,Penny,Oh my God now I know what I sound like to you when I say stupid stuff.
21544,Penny,Ugh would you stop? We just did it as a goof.
21545,Penny,Leonard.
21546,Leonard,Mmm in all fairness Pictionary has verbal skills visual skills. It’s a pretty well-rounded game.
21547,Howard,Fine how about this? You’re making me uncomfortable by prolonging this ridiculous fight and I wish you’d stop.
21548,Howard,Oh okay. Uh brothers and sisters I have none but this man’s father is my father’s son. Who am I looking at? Yeah yeah we get it you want brains. Calm down.
21549,Sheldon,No. I didn’t start yet it’s fine.
21550,Howard,My father’s a gynaecologist I think I can handle it. And now I’m gay.
21551,Penny,Okay well there are no shower scenes in this one. They just try to clone me from my corpse but my DNA gets mixed with the ape’s DNA and I end up running around with giant gorilla hands and feet.
21552,Howard,A friend at the School of Pharmacology gave me these new pills they’re testing. He says it’s the next big thing for social anxiety disorder.
21553,Sheldon,Well I’m not everybody. I have an eidetic memory. I should be able to remember what song this is but I can’t. Something’s wrong with me.
21554,Sheldon,Yes.
21555,Penny,No it’s not okay? I’ve been out here for like ten years. I’ve nothing to show for it.
21556,Sheldon,Well we’re only watching Game of Thrones. A party sub implies it’s a party.
21557,Raj,I would love to see your collection.
21558,Penny,Mmmm. Now I feel bad for picking on all those kids. Although in my defence if Danny Biffle didn’t want to eat a mouthful of dirt he shouldn’t have shown up to school wearing a bow tie.
21559,Penny,What do you want Howard?
21560,Raj,Thank you for forgiving me.
21561,Penny,Hello.
21562,Sheldon,I don’t understand why women insist on making a big production out of buying clothes.
21563,Howard,What is everyone booing at?
21564,Howard,Well this is kind of anti-climactic.
21565,Leonard,I think it is.
21566,Penny,What?
21568,Howard,I thought we were best friends?
21569,Sheldon,It’s still there. Takes me 45 minutes to get through airport security. 
21570,Leonard,Okay we’re headed out see you later.
21571,Sheldon,I believe I can answer that.
21572,Sheldon,Oh please. For Vulcans mating or if you will Pon Farr it’s an extremely private matter.
21573,Sheldon,You don’t know? Oh you poor dear. Your ovaries are squirting so much goofy juice into your brains you don’t even know which way is up. You made an inappropriate sexual advance towards Dr. Hofstadter.
21574,Howard,But after the cantina scene.
21575,Leonard,That’s so great. 
21576,Sheldon,I’m practicing my theremin.
21577,Howard,Because she’s great in everything.
21578,Penny,Ah-da-da-da-da let the dead man talk. So why do you think that?
21579,Sheldon,Hot glue.
21580,Sheldon,Yes. In 1917 when Albert Einstein established the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung his fondest hope was that the resultant device be bitchin’.
21581,Leonard,No it’s fine. You can ditch away.
21582,Raj,Okay. Did we at least rent the car from Enterprise? Get it? Enterprise? Screw you. That’s funny.
21583,Leonard,I don’t know. What do you want me to do?
21584,Raj,Hey Sheldon guess what I heard today?
21585,Penny,I just got a part on a TV show.
21586,Penny,Of course not.
21587,Sheldon,I’ll tell you why. Amy ruined Raiders of the Lost Ark for me so now I’m trying to find something beloved to her and ruin that.
21588,Raj,One ladder left.
21589,Sheldon,Uh Mylar balloons yes. Latex balloons no. Water balloons I will jump off the roof and aim for your car.
21590,Penny,Oh dear God.
21591,Sheldon,Three thousand hours. Three thousand hours clicking on that mouse collecting weapons and gold. It’s almost as if it was a huge waste of time.
21592,Penny,Okay I just have one question. What exactly are sub-atomic particles?
21593,Sheldon,Oh good you got my note. Penny I’d like you to meet Tom uh Penny this is Tom Tom may I present Penny.
21594,Penny,Thanks. I just wanted to come by and wish you guys luck with your symposium.
21595,Leonard,Hey. Guess who’s going to be at the comic bookstore on Thursday?
21596,Penny,That’s right.
21597,Howard,Hey.
21598,Sheldon,She’s not my girlfriend.
21599,Sheldon,Oh everything I could possibly need to win the scavenger hunt.
21600,Leonard,Okay well do you want to go?
21601,Raj,You sure?
21602,Raj,It is if you love her and give her a name.
21603,Sheldon,Power failure. Implementing power-failure protocol.
21604,Raj,Hey hey. Feelings.
21605,Sheldon,Why do you get to be Batman?
21606,Penny,What should I have done? Taken a picture of us in the car and put it in a pink frame with puffy paint around it that says best fiancé ever?
21607,Leonard,Thank you.
21608,Sheldon,Here’s two dollars. Go buy some beef jerky.
21609,Leonard,I thought you were good at this. You’re always talking about how you go to bars and meet women.
21610,Penny,Great.
21611,Penny,This is exactly why I didn’t want to talk about it.
21612,Sheldon,Look at us Leonard engaging in the social convention of men bellyaching about their ol’ ladies.
21613,Sheldon,Oh thank you.
21614,Sheldon,Uganda.
21615,Raj,Is it bad? Did you hear something? Oh my God. It’s bad. Somebody kill me.
21616,Howard,Hey Leonard will you please tell Howard my sister’s never been attracted to him.
21617,Howard,I’m not making any promises.
21618,Howard,Dr. Nowitzki. Good to see you.
21619,Sheldon,That’s the most romantic thing I’ve ever heard.
21620,Sheldon,We looked great.
21621,Sheldon,See? It was fine. I didn’t need a time-out.
21622,Raj,Maybe I won’t settle down. Maybe I’ll just play the field.
21623,Sheldon,Yeah well you’re an engineer. End of joke burn.
21624,Sheldon,This is a documentary about Mr. Spock. I’m sure if there’s nudity it will be tasteful.
21625,Leonard,Good night.
21626,Sheldon,Cluck cluck cluck. What are we ladies at a quilting bee? Or are we men playing a fantasy card game set in a magical frontier town?
21627,Penny,No you told me.
21628,Sheldon,It won’t work. The diameter of the tubing is insufficient.
21629,Sheldon,You’re right it can wait until morning.
21630,Leonard,I did agree to the thermostat setting and I shouldn’t have tried to change it.
21631,Penny,That’s great.
21632,Sheldon,It has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.
21634,Leonard,Okay.
21635,Raj,Okay let’s talk about something else.
21637,Sheldon,One Game of Thrones collector’s edition Longclaw sword. Oh Leonard and I bought that together. That’s a bit of an ethical conundrum. Eh I’ll keep it.
21638,Penny,Ah cool.
21639,Howard,That’s two dude. Write your own jokes.
21640,Howard,Funny how that worked out.
21641,Penny,Yeah.
21642,Howard,Well then I should tell you I broke the wheel and the handle. So is everyone from Bernadette’s company going to Vegas?
21643,Penny,Oh hi!
21644,Raj,Bernadette come on look you’re overthinking this okay? You’re gonna be an amazing mom. Even if you don’t believe it I know you have maternal instincts.
21645,Penny,Don’t tell Amy that. We’ll be here every Sunday.
21646,Penny,That’s why I work at the Cheesecake Factory I’m holding out for the right part.
21647,Sheldon,Just out of curiosity do we still have hot dogs?
21648,Leonard,Psst.
21649,Howard,Oh my God here he comes. This is it.
21650,Penny,Oh yeah.
21651,Leonard,The needs of the many.
21652,Leonard,Hmm recently? Not much.
21653,Sheldon,No I can’t authorize that.
21654,Sheldon,Oh. Well I feel both flattered and hurt. Like when people say I look like that skeleton from Nightmare Before Christmas.
21655,Raj,Problem Wil Wheaton?
21656,Sheldon,Un momento. Oh for heaven’s sake now you’re being deliberately stupid.  Where are you going?
21657,Penny,Okay Leonard let’s go.
21658,Sheldon,Wait can I bring this box of extra shirt buttons to sort on the ride?
21659,Howard,I’m telling you dude the only way to feel better about Penny going out with other guys is for you to get back on the whores.
21660,Howard,You started it dude.
21661,Raj,In a minute. Howard stepped outside to throw up.
21662,Raj,I don’t know it’s a marketing scheme. Please Sheldon I’m a young virile visitor from a foreign land and I need to strut my stuff.
21663,Penny,I’m going to create a character and a situation and you just jump in when you feel it.
21664,Penny,Okay.
21665,Leonard,No.
21666,Leonard,Is this all stuff you want me to try on?
21667,Howard,Come on. What do you say? Let me make it up to you.
21668,Sheldon,Is there a station coming up where I can board your giggling train of thought?
21669,Sheldon,I’m removing my digital footprint from the Internet so Amy Farrah Fowler can’t find me and compel me to meet her mother.
21670,Raj,Mmm Greek food on pizza night? This is the most delightfully cruel thing we’ve done to Sheldon since we left that fake message from Stephen Hawking on his voice mail.
21671,Leonard,Sheldon I got to go inside. It’s getting rough out here.
21672,Leonard,Uh kung fu letters might not be politically correct.
21673,Leonard,Yup. I told him if he didn’t bite the hygienist I’d take him for ice cream.
21674,Sheldon,Yeah.
21675,Penny,What does your gut tell you?
21676,Penny,Wow can’t believe he has a girlfriend.
21677,Sheldon,Oh thank you.
21678,Leonard,FYI his toothbrush is the red one in the plexiglass case under the UV light.
21679,Sheldon,Wonderful. I’m being musically encouraged to bust a move. If I knew what that meant I might just do it.
21680,Sheldon,What’s the occasion?
21681,Penny,Okay I know I shouldn’t ask but what is…?
21682,Leonard,You love The Simpsons.
21683,Leonard,Yeah he has a very sensitive butt. Well it’s true. Once I saw him sit on a bunch of loose change and add it up.
21684,Penny,She’d be proud huh?
21685,Sheldon,I don’t think so Kripke. I’ve bounced many a rubber ball in my day.
21686,Howard,The only threesome I’ve ever had in my life and I’m proud to say it was with this man right here.
21687,Sheldon,What does it look like?
21688,Leonard,Come on let’s go.
21689,Leonard,Can we please stop talking about poodles?
21690,Raj,Listen dude it’s time for you to hit the road.
21691,Sheldon,It was fine. Other than the weird-tasting juice Amy gave me I slept the whole way.
21692,Sheldon,I can consider a place America’s urinal cake and still enjoy the occasional visit.
21693,Raj,He’s depressed because he’s pathetic and creepy and he can’t get girls.
21694,Raj,Yes but him doesn’t even know about her.
21695,Penny,No. No come on I want to do it.
21696,Sheldon,What do you propose?
21697,Leonard,I can try but your plan has the words garbage bag and Slim Jim in it.
21698,Leonard,Did she seem upset to you?
21699,Leonard,It’s obviously a typo.
21700,Leonard,Uh yeah. It’s issue number 21. First appearance of Hellboy.
21701,Leonard,You know rather than mock me my friends might realize that this is difficult and try to help me through it.
21702,Leonard,Wow. When does that start?
21703,Penny,Oh the poor thing.
21704,Leonard,I’m trying to think of an answer that won’t stop you from doing this.
21705,Penny,Well I’ve been thinking and maybe I’m ready to take things a little faster.
21706,Sheldon,One on one? We don’t play one on one we play teams not one on one. One on one!
21707,Howard,Okay what page are you on?
21708,Sheldon,Shelly! Shelly how many times have I told you not to leave your sciencey stuff out on the porch? Goodness I’ll never understand that boy. But then again I’m a religious nut and my mind is closed to so many things.
21709,Sheldon,Looks like argon’s not the only one with an attitude problem.
21710,Penny,Then sit in the car and keep it running.
21711,Sheldon,Not yet.
21712,Sheldon,Yes. And that’s coming from me.
21713,Howard,Oh yeah.
21714,Penny,I blame Penny too. Bad Penny.
21715,Sheldon,Excuse me. You’re misusing the word ho. It’s an interjection used to call attention to a destination not an object as in uh Land ho! Or uh Westward ho!
21716,Leonard,Yup oh here you go.
21717,Penny,No they’re not.
21718,Penny,You know I’m sorry.
21719,Sheldon,I trust Penny will adhere to the Official California Restaurant Workers’ Solemn Oath of Ethics and Cleanliness.”
21720,Raj,I’d like you to call me sexy.
21721,Sheldon,Now forgive me for eavesdropping but as I see it there’s a simple solution.
21722,Leonard,Come on help me out. Am I in trouble?
21723,Penny,22.
21724,Leonard,Yeah I could say something like that to her. I’ll go do that. Thank you.
21725,Raj,Yeah you…
21726,Raj,Also my cousin.
21727,Howard,‘Cause I I’m tired of trying to meet someone and I think I’d like you to help me find uh a wife.
21728,Howard,What’s this button do?
21729,Penny,And say what? That I didn’t mean it because I meant it.
21730,Penny,Okay there’s going to no more shouting and no skeet-shooting.
21731,Sheldon,Oh God. Don’t make it so hard on her. Look the first someone is the deceitful you. The second someone is the delightful Dr. Lorvis.
21732,Penny,All right try thinking about this. Sheldon and Amy had sex.
21733,Leonard,Oh the package that we paid for said the aisle was supposed to be strewn with rose petals.
21734,Sheldon,Oh well you two sit down and get to know each other. I’ll get your room ready.
21735,Sheldon,All right I’ll try.
21736,Leonard,Hang on I know I don’t possess the tools of leadership but I don’t understand why we can’t assemble the equipment inside the hut and then take it outside.
21737,Sheldon,Shh. All right I’m invoking our bodysnatchers clause.
21738,Howard,Actually I was less the chatter than the chattee.
21739,Sheldon,Me neither. But I just had a tickle in my throat not profound marital problems.
21740,Sheldon,I know it doesn’t seem like it to you but for me what we have is extremely intimate.
21741,Leonard,Why?
21742,Penny,Yeah.
21743,Sheldon,That’s it. The baby’s here. It’s a boy.
21744,Sheldon,Thank you for making me tea.
21745,Penny,Sure.
21746,Penny,Hold on I’m trying to decide if I’m mad at you. No I’m happy I don’t have to go.
21747,Leonard,Doesn’t matter.
21748,Leonard,Yeah I’m okay. Did you spill ketchup?
21749,Penny,Yeah.
21750,Leonard,That was really crappy of me. What you’re trying to do is hard but people do make it and I really do believe you could be one of them.
21752,Penny,Yeah I listen to what you say. You’re building a particle detector using superfluid helium.
21753,Raj,No.
21754,Howard,I’m just saying we don’t know who this guy is. What if he wants to steal our money or our kidneys or make a suit outof our skins?
21755,Penny,Oh! Okay. Wow.
21756,Sheldon,Really? That’s where I was born!
21757,Leonard,Not if you believe his doctors.
21758,Leonard,Yeah Stephanie got them for me.
21759,Penny,So are the rest of the guys meeting us here?
21760,Sheldon,No I’m not. French fries have three variables crispiness saltiness and shape. Which is why a curly fry only gets a two. If I wanted curls for dinner I’d order a clown wig.
21761,Sheldon,A hybrid dog and octopus. Man’s underwater best friend.
21762,Howard,Okay murder suspects Leonard has found the time machine the killer must’ve used. You’re all inside it and we hurtle through the very fabric of time. And welcome to 20 years in the future. Hey you guys just time-travelled. Stop looking so bored.
21763,Leonard,The Eta Meson.
21764,Howard,Oh who was that girl from our Starbucks?
21765,Raj,Roger Abbott Roger Abbott Roger Abbott. Oh my God Leonard I know he’s dead but try it. It’s fun. Roger Abbott Roger Abbott.
21766,Leonard,Okay but it’s a drive the one I went to is in San Diego.
21767,Howard,But dude you’re so lucky. Getting to stay home at night with the woman you love.
21768,Penny,‘Cause in the olden days I never would’ve known he was so stupid.
21769,Leonard,Oh that poor waiter.
21770,Sheldon,Hm!
21772,Leonard,Okay then let’s do this lets go to Las Vegas.
21773,Leonard,Hey you were right.
21774,Leonard,Do you think she’s as honest with you?
21775,Penny,That’s exactly what we’re gonna do because you’re about to make me cry and we both know if I start crying you’re gonna start crying.
21776,Sheldon,I won’t go out on a limb but I think we may be looking at my new Tuesday hamburger.
21777,Sheldon,Well Gollum you’re an expert on rings. What do I do with this one?
21778,Raj,Oh grow up.
21779,Leonard,No problem. Welcome home. 
21780,Sheldon,Well it’s funny you should ask because I was wondering how you’d feel about separating the two of us with a pillow wall.
21781,Sheldon,Shouldn’t you check your database?
21782,Penny,Okay question 1. Rank the following aspects of Sheldon Cooper in order of appeal. Intelligence. Ruthless attention to hygiene. Playfulness. Java applet writing?
21783,Sheldon,Yes. Oh fun story she grew up with ten siblings. Or possibly penguins. Her English is atrocious.
21784,Penny, Sheldon.
21785,Sheldon,Well now that I’ve given up string theory I’m struggling to find my next area of focus. So in your professional opinion which of these areas do you think is the most promising?
21786,Howard,Like a hero.
21787,Leonard,The flower dies.
21788,Penny,Why don’t you just admit you overreacted?
21789,Sheldon,Were you under the impression that Leonard has no complaints about you?
21790,Penny,Really? Oh you’re the best husband ever.
21791,Howard,You’re wasting your time. Just please leave me alone.
21792,Sheldon,Captain Hook’s hand was eaten by a crocodile not an alligator. If you’re going to mock me at least get your facts straight.
21793,Howard,Oh that’s very impressive. And a little racist.
21794,Howard,Good because I would hate that.
21795,Sheldon,I can’t listen to the two of you fight anymore.
21796,Howard,Okay. Please. So uh you you have tattoos?
21797,Sheldon, This is the temperature you agreed to in the roommate agreement.
21798,Howard,Yeah okay so zombies.
21799,Howard,You are my lady. Our parents said so. We are for all intents and purposes one hundred percent hooked up.
21800,Sheldon,Amy Farrah Fowler has asked me to meet her mother.
21801,Sheldon,You tell people I’m a rocket scientist?
21802,Sheldon,I’m surprised to hear that. See the other day I was concerned that you weren’t recovering so while you were sleeping I took a cheek swab and had it cultured in the lab.
21803,Penny,I killed it. I was even able to cry real tears right on the spot.
21804,Leonard,Did you guys see the paper in The American Physics Journal on supersolids? It’s pretty interesting. This guy’s working from a hypothesis where…
21805,Leonard,Raj and Howard are at Howard’s mom’s but should we call the girls and see if they want to come?
21806,Leonard,Well I may be a man but I think I’m the one that screwed up on this one.
21807,Leonard,If you want to drive just drive. I don’t see why this has to be so complicated.
21808,Raj,Dude! I was about to Bollywood this bitch.
21809,Sheldon,Got it.
21810,Leonard,Yeah I can see that. Sheldon Halo night Koothrappali’s. You coming?
21811,Penny,You know in Girl Scouts Tammie Dinisha said you could do that with panty hose. Boy was she wrong. Anyway you want to make out?
21812,Sheldon,She does have a short attention span.
21813,Howard,Hey.
21814,Sheldon,I hope you’re happy making me read this. Bert’s work is remarkable and I’m more upset than ever. This is worse than when I had to admit that Cedric the Entertainer’s actually entertaining.
21815,Sheldon,If you want to blend in with Penny’s friends I’d think looking like an idiot would be the perfect camouflage.
21816,Raj,It’s called Lamaze breathing. It helps you push.
21817,Penny,All right that’s enough. 
21818,Penny,Yeah you get some sleep.
21819,Penny,Hmm how about gee Penny you’re smarter than I thought. You may be the one in school but I’m the one who learned a lesson. I’m so stupid Penny. Duh.
21820,Sheldon,Oh hold on. While I’m comfortable speaking about science I’m not sure I know how to spark the interest of schoolchildren. Better Google it.
21821,Leonard,Amy broke up with Sheldon.
21822,Penny,Oh it’s cool I’ve never been on a podcast before.
21823,Raj,Can you believe it? Little Priya’s one of the lead attorneys for the biggest car company in India.
21824,Penny,Hey that guy’s looking over here.
21825,Sheldon,In a perfect world I’d lock you in a stockade in the public square. That probably requires a permit.
21826,Penny,I cannot believe you’ve never seen Grease.
21827,Sheldon,This is the very copy of The Handbook of Chemistry and Physics in which I looked up the reaction rates of mendelevium and…
21828,Sheldon,And I think I’ve got it. Consider a family possesses a dog that is so large and poorly disciplined he causes nothing but problems. Why do they keep him?
21829,Sheldon,Oh pulling strings are we?
21830,Sheldon,Yeah I appreciate the ride.
21831,Leonard,Look at these notebooks. They’re full of pages and pages of data. He clearly spent years on this.
21832,Howard,Oh dude you are never getting a shiksa goddess.
21833,Raj,Yeah that sounds fun. A party-bus party don’t stop. Ooh when I say party you say bus.
21834,Penny,Raj what about you?
21835,Raj,Okay but something smells fishy. And not just because you work around sea animals. That actually sounds interesting and I’d like to learn more about it. Hey you okay?
21836,Sheldon,Well don’t ask me. Until I see the prequel I’m lost.
21837,Leonard,Oh uh uh uh sausage. Uh uh uh uh bratwurst? Oh oh a hot dog.
21838,Penny,Okay. Just for the record I have never entered a wet T-shirt contest. I’ve won a few but that’s just because I spill when I’m drunk so…
21839,Sheldon,Oh well that’s laying it on a little thick.
21840,Sheldon,What Leonard please. I know an angry face when I see it. It’s this red frowny guy on my phone.
21841,Leonard,I don’t believe it what’s gotten into him?
21842,Penny,‘Cause when I wear it it’s a shirt. So what’s Howard doing tonight?
21843,Howard,You mean some guy in a lame suit?
21844,Leonard,I don’t know I think we might owe the guy an apology.
21845,Sheldon,Of course. That’s how you move a conversation forward.
21846,Howard,Did you forget what Penny did to you? It took you two years and defiling my sister to turn that frown upside down.
21847,Penny,That’s your big revelation?
21848,Raj,Wonder what she saw in that guy.
21849,Raj,Howard my father cut me off. I have to get my money back for this.
21850,Penny,Hey Sheldon.
21851,Howard,Actually I’ve never had three dates with the same woman.
21852,Leonard,But Penny this was your idea. You said that I should stand up to him.
21853,Sheldon,Alright then. 
21854,Raj,Eating cake on the toilet single.
21855,Sheldon,I like being chauffeured around. It makes me feel important.
21856,Penny,Okay it’s done. Look guys for the future I don’t mind killing the big spiders but you have to at least try with the little ones.
21857,Leonard,Seconded.
21858,Penny,Oh Amy please.
21859,Raj,Please sit. I uh I got you a cappuccino. I remembered it was your favourite. I also got crumb cake but I remembered it was my favourite and I ate it. Anyway uh how are you?
21860,Sheldon,I do. Now let’s find the kind of gift that makes her feel small and worthless.
21861,Leonard,Are you mad at me?
21862,Leonard,Why would I be upset?
21863,Leonard,Thank you.
21864,Penny,Boy that’s brilliant but I’ll see you.
21865,Penny,Why don’t you keep it?
21866,Penny,Look there’s something I need to tell you.
21867,Leonard,I thought the measures were going to be the stars of the show turns out it was the weights.
21868,Leonard,Uh-huh it goes with my corduroy suit.
21869,Leonard,I don’t think this is gonna work.
21870,Sheldon,And who’s this guy you’re taking?
21871,Penny,Yeah I just have to change.
21872,Sheldon,In Leonard’s defence it wasn’t for lack of trying.
21873,Howard,Hey I didn’t even mention Dum Dum Dugan or Green Goblin Matt Murdock Pepper Potts Victor Von Doom oh and worst of all Millie the Model.
21874,Leonard,What are you guys doing?
21875,Sheldon,You are ignoring the square-cube law. The giant ant would be crushed under the weight of its own exoskeleton. And for the record the appropriate ranking of cool modes of transportation is jet pack hoverboard transporter Batmobile and then giant ant.
21876,Leonard,He got all of his stuff stolen.
21877,Raj,Oh uh come in come in. Oh I uh I didn’t think I was going to get to see you until tomorrow.
21878,Raj,We don’t get paid? Nothing? Not even a sandwich?
21879,Leonard,Why didn’t you tell me?
21880,Sheldon, I don’t have to go to Hell. At 73 degrees I’m there already!
21881,Sheldon,Fine. Now that we’re not playing you can be green.
21882,Leonard,I’m not okay.
21883,Penny,Thankyou maybe we can have coffee sometime.
21884,Sheldon,Come along Amy. I know when I’m not wanted.
21885,Raj,I love this time of the year. The leaves are turning there’s a bracing chill in the air.
21886,Leonard,Skee-Ball tickets?
21887,Howard,All right.  Who do we have here?
21888,Sheldon,Hello.
21889,Leonard,You’re a hero.
21890,Sheldon,How can you say that? Amy’s gone and you two are married now so it’s only a matter of time before you’re gone too.
21891,Howard,Hi yeah. Um I was wondering if you’re free Saturday night all my friends are going to a wine tasting.
21892,Penny,I can’t I have that job interview.
21893,Sheldon,Oh. That’s a lot of incense. Or someone set a hippie on fire.
21894,Sheldon,He also has a remarkable amount of credit card debt.
21895,Sheldon,No. Glenn’s was leather. He was a simple ostrich. Is! Is I haven’t given up hope.
21896,Penny,Okay ground rules no sponge baths and definitely no enemas.
21897,Sheldon,Why do you get to be Batman?
21898,Raj,Did you think it would be funny to put on a pair of her panties and jump around but it wound up just creeping her out?
21899,Sheldon,You got the wrong mustard.
21900,Sheldon,Thank you.
21901,Penny,Well what about Bernadette?
21902,Penny,Mmm. How’s Leonard doing?
21903,Sheldon,No. Here’s a thought. You’re not moving in Leonard’s not moving out everything stays exactly the way it is. And by the way I saw you make this Strawberry Quik with syrup you’re supposed to use the powder.
21904,Leonard,That was amazing how you handled him.
21905,Sheldon,Fine. As you know I have a twin sister with whom I obviously share a birthday. Every year we’d have a party. No one I invited would ever come because they didn’t like me.
21906,Sheldon,What if I told you that I was the voice of Yoda? A recording session I must attend.
21907,Howard,Hey I won a Newcomb medal too.
21908,Howard,I’ll stick with eleven. She liked Howard better.
21909,Sheldon,Ah what might have been. And you give my regards to Barnum and Bailey.
21910,Sheldon,No wait! I have a speech.
21911,Penny,Oh. Where’s Raj?
21912,Leonard,This isn’t a substitution it’s a reduction.
21914,Penny,Mmm. And I got you a transporter too!
21915,Penny,As usual nice talking to you Raj 
21916,Sheldon,That’s for when I’m sick. Sad is not sick.
21917,Howard,Okay you got me there. You here looking for money?
21918,Leonard,Guys let’s remember that Sheldon is still our friend and my room mate.
21919,Leonard,Whoa whoa hang on. There’s no need to insult her.
21920,Leonard,If we find my backup inhaler maybe we can get frisky.
21921,Penny,Okay you listen to me. I think it’s really sweet you’re trying to protect your friend but this is none of your business. Got it?
21922,Sheldon,Just breaking in your new car.
21923,Leonard,Fine. Just tell me what to do and I’ll do it.
21924,Penny,Hi.
21925,Raj,Hear hear.
21926,Howard,Thank you.
21927,Raj,I knew it. Okay we did have a vibe. This is exciting. What’s my next move?
21928,Leonard,Aw that used to work with Sheldon.
21929,Leonard,No she had dental insurance.
21930,Sheldon,Hey.
21931,Leonard,Look at me. Dancing with the prettiest girl at the prom.
21932,Raj,Well that seems fair.
21933,Sheldon,Since we got home from the comic bookstore.
21934,Penny,That bad huh?
21935,Leonard,You don’t know what a sex tape is do you?
21936,Sheldon,Be the ball Howard.
21937,Sheldon,A disappointing drink for a disappointing day.
21938,Penny,Okay I realize that…
21939,Penny,Well you named it.
21940,Sheldon,Excuse me Wolverine Origin. Miniseries issue two page 22. Retractable bone claws. If you people spent less time thinking about sex and more time concentrating on comic books we’d have far fewer of these embarrassing moments.
21941,Leonard,I was going to see that with him.
21942,Leonard,It’s a Saturnalia miracle.
21943,Leonard,No.
21944,Raj,Sheldon what did Amy have that attracted you?
21945,Penny,Yeah well whatever okay? I told you Valentine’s Day sucks.
21946,Penny,Yeah.
21947,Leonard,Fine what is it?
21948,Raj,Are you sure? They turn off the lights and it’s like a cute little laser show that poops all over the place.
21949,Leonard,Well we’re we’re very happy for you.
21950,Penny,Whoa. Not so fast.
21951,Leonard,Did you know that per our roommate agreement I have to wash my feet before I get in the shower? And not in the sink. We each have special buckets.
21952,Penny,Mm.
21953,Howard,I’m sorry have I been complaining about it too much?
21954,Sheldon,I’ve got it. He didn’t remember me because the last time we met I was in a Halloween costume.
21955,Penny,We do?
21956,Leonard,Not really.
21957,Howard,Are you turning it the right way?
21959,Leonard,Third floor wrong apartment.
21960,Sheldon,Oh yes. It was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life. I’d hate for that effort to have been in vain.
21961,Leonard,Well yeah sex with you is pretty great. Have you ever tried it?
21962,Leonard,No.
21963,Howard,Hallway. 
21964,Sheldon,I don’t think I can go back out there.
21965,Raj,You know I struggle with Batman.
21966,Penny,So you want to turn yourself into some sort of robot?
21967,Leonard,Hey do you want to hang out with us?
21968,Penny,Uh how about a grasshopper. I make a mean grasshopper. Okay? Good. Coming up. Sheldon what are you going to have?
21969,Sheldon,No that’s the season two finale. That was quite the cliffhanger. I’m going to re-watch it before season three starts.
21970,Sheldon,So it’s my turn. Why did you set it for the day before yesterday?
21971,Sheldon,A reasonable question. I asked myself what is the most mind-numbing pedestrian job conceivable and three answers came to mind uh toll booth attendant an Apple Store genius and what Penny does. Now since I don’t like touching other people’s coins and I refuse to contribute to the devaluation of the word genius here I am.
21972,Howard,Actually you’re all just gonna be yourselves.
21973,Leonard,Yeah sure.
21974,Sheldon,You know what this means don’t you? Break out the Red Bull it’s time to rock Mario old school.
21975,Penny,Are you doing okay?
21976,Leonard,Well look at that. Burned a whole calorie.
21977,Sheldon,What I want is irrelevant. This is Penny’s decision. Penny?
21978,Penny,That isn’t even your problem the problem is you don’t trust me!
21979,Sheldon,It wasn’t funny.
21980,Sheldon,Professor Hawking.
21981,Leonard,On the floor.
21982,Leonard,Is there a theme?
21983,Penny,My dad asked if I can get him a job interview at my work.
21984,Leonard,Plus I’m not sure it’s a great idea to take Penny to where wine comes from. What? It’s a joke. Oh come on. We bust on each other. I wear dorky glasses you might have a problem it’s all for laughs.
21985,Leonard,This train thing worked out better than I thought. He’s home studying the engineer’s manual.
21986,Leonard,So what’s going on with you two?
21987,Sheldon,The top secret military information I’m about to tell you.
21988,Penny,Oh thanks I’m not hungry.
21989,Penny,How about Howard?
21990,Leonard,Well I’ve had it. I am done. I can’t I can’t live with him for one more minute.
21991,Leonard,I thought you were back with Emily.
21992,Leonard,The lights flash and the dish spins you wanna try it?
21993,Leonard,No.
21994,Sheldon,What is that you’re eating? Tonight is pizza night.
21995,Raj,Well lots of scientists believe in God. Okay? Newton uh Faraday uh Pascal all were believers. Even Einstein was famous for attacking quantum theory on the grounds that God does not play dice with the universe.
21996,Leonard,Huh yeah?
21997,Penny,Bernadette? Girl’s weekend. Vegas. You in?
21998,Penny,Yes but you’re not smarter than all of us put together.
21999,Sheldon,Well I’ll catch you up. Uh Penny is angry at Leonard Leonard’s angry at me and Penny I’m angry at Leonard and Amy Raj is angry at Howard and I’m angry at George R.R. Martin ’cause there are no new books for me to spoil for Leonard.
22000,Sheldon,Well there’s really not much left to tell. I decided that my mother views me as a child because I never went through a rebellious phase so I got an earring.  And here we are.
22001,Penny,If it makes you feel any better I pierced Amy’s ears and her mom made her sit in my closet.
22002,Penny,Not.
22003,Howard,Back off Sheldon.
22004,Leonard,Little bit. 
22005,Penny,Okay maybe you’ll have another chance to have…
22006,Sheldon,I miss you as well.
22007,Sheldon,Can’t figure out what to do? I remember those days. Now if you’ll excuse me I have to…  stay right here.
22008,Raj,You know if I had a week off I’d go back to the Two Bunch Palms Resort and Spa in the desert. I tell you an hour on the massage table with Trevor and you’ll feel like you were born without bones.
22009,Raj,Are you single?
22010,Leonard,Just said Howard’s a terrific guy. He’s got a great sense of humour he loves his mother a lot some people say too much.
22011,Raj,Me? No. I just got Vegas baby from Vince Vaughn in Swingers. .
22012,Raj,So where are we going?
22013,Raj,Okay Sheldon. Yeah I’m putting you in charge of my finances. I will not spend another penny that you don’t authorize.
22014,Sheldon,The Lord of the Rings trilogy was nearly 11 hours. I made you watch that you said it was an eternity.
22015,Penny,It’s sweet how you look out for him. You’re a good guy.
22016,Leonard,Thank you.
22018,Sheldon,How am I supposed to know that? As the teacher it’s your obligation to separate your personal idiosyncrasies from the subject matter.
22019,Sheldon,Just do your laundry.
22020,Leonard,I think you look fantastic.
22021,Sheldon,Huh what?
22022,Leonard,Hey. Listen since we got you know interrupted last night I didn’t have a chance to give you this.
22023,Leonard,What happened? Did you tell him it was my idea?
22024,Sheldon,This is an important night for us and I’m worried I might be overwhelmed and ruin everything.
22025,Penny,Oh.
22026,Sheldon,Yes. Yeah just put on your squeaky shoes and eee-eee-eee your way out of my life.
22027,Sheldon,Oh my goodness she’s coming to visit!
22029,Howard,Yeah you’d think. Ooh maybe I could sell my blood and sperm.
22030,Leonard,That should lighten the mood.
22031,Raj,Ooh I don’t like where this is going.
22032,Sheldon,But I must have it.
22033,Howard,She’s kidding right?
22034,Raj,Better?
22035,Leonard,Uh I do I have to work. But I’m gonna blow that off to spend the evening with my sweetie and her father ’cause you know just the kind of boyfriend I am.
22036,Raj,So Siri what’s happening? How are you?
22037,Sheldon,Oh I feel closer to you too. You know it’s still a couple of hours until my bedtime.
22038,Leonard,No! no my point is if you want to learn how to make friends then just go out to a coffee shop or a museum. Meet people. Talk to them. Take an interest in their lives.
22039,Sheldon,We’re not friends at the moment. Depends on how this goes.
22040,Penny,Fine.
22041,Sheldon,I can’t believe I was surpassed by a geologist. I mean rocks. He studies rocks. If rock is so great how come paper beats it? Leonard I’m having a primal urge to throw this rock.
22042,Sheldon,I have real problems here Amy. I can’t be mollified with a beverage designed for children. Mmm yummy.
22043,Leonard,Yeah it’s “Penny already eats our food she can pay for Wi-Fi.” No spaces.
22044,Penny,Because I’m young. Let’s go.
22045,Sheldon,Good point. Basket of puppies.
22046,Leonard,Sheldon this is superfluid helium. Put this in your mouth your tongue will freeze and break off.
22048,Leonard,Hi.
22049,Leonard,Save it for your blog Howard.
22050,Raj,All the more shame that will fall upon the house of Hofstadter.
22052,Raj,Yeah Meemaw did the nasty.
22053,Howard,No you wouldn’t. You’d be intimidated by my wealth and fame. My only friends would be my genetically engineered monkey butler and the little people I hired to be my living chess set.
22054,Sheldon,Yeah. Tell me those aren’t the words of a man with a spider eating its way through his brain. Amy you’re a neuroscientist. Crack his skull open spray some Raid in there.
22055,Raj,Please Penny let me. We’ve decided to let our crazy wonderful night together be just one of those memories you have and can call to mind when you’re feeling blue or you’re in the shower.
22056,Leonard,Look Penny we’d love to help you but Raj is going through some stuff right now. And besides he doesn’t drink so…  Really? Um Raj is going through some stuff right now and he’d like to take up drinking.
22057,Leonard,Bummer. Anyway I was thinking tonight maybe we could catch a movie.
22058,Penny,No but I can name all the Kardashians.
22059,Raj,I think we’re fitting in quite nicely.
22060,Sheldon,Well then apparently you hate fun.
22061,Howard,All I’m gonna say is you guys need to stop this right now. It. it’s bad enough that my parents are fighting now I have to hear the two of you? And who cares who’s smarter? If it’s Leonard or me or you know it’s Christmas let’s say it’s Howard.
22062,Howard,That’s so amazing.
22064,Leonard,I don’t know if you want to do that I was just okay never mind.
22065,Penny,So how’s it goin’?
22066,Penny,Guys seriously I grew up on a farm okay I rebuilt a tractor engine when I was like twelve I think I can put together a cheap Swedish media centre.
22067,Penny,Well sort of.
22068,Howard,You know screw it I’m just gonna eat the dumpling.
22069,Penny,Uh I don’t know a bar?
22071,Sheldon,I brought my own. No sense in risking bridge-of-nose herpes.
22072,Sheldon,I understand. All I need is for you to authorize these tests.
22073,Penny,What the hell is that?
22074,Penny,‘Cause you’re trying too hard. You need to do something else get your mind off it.
22075,Sheldon,But why are you here?
22076,Penny,Excuse me?
22077,Sheldon,It appears to be a Lord of the Rings ring.
22078,Leonard,Why are you introducing yourself?
22079,Penny,Okay you guys are overreacting. Raj is gonna appreciate how I had his back.
22080,Sheldon,I’ll go for two hundred that time machine stays right where it is.
22081,Penny,And he started to slowly wear me down.
22082,Penny,Wow sounds a lot like being a pretty waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.
22084,Leonard,Penny you’ve got cheetos in your hair.
22085,Leonard,Not really it’s what you and I would call condescension.
22086,Leonard,Thank you. I thought we might start by talking about the user interface.
22087,Sheldon,Yeah that’s great. Did you bring your puppet?
22088,Sheldon,Like Jane Goodall observing the apes I initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured but patterns emerge they have their own language if you will.
22089,Sheldon,No it did at first but then I talked it through with Frank and Alicia and they really helped put things into perspective.
22090,Penny,Okay sex is not what makes you a grown-up.
22091,Leonard,There’s no junk jiggling. We just talk.
22092,Sheldon,It is to me; that’s the point.
22093,Leonard,Always is a long time. Sure. Always.
22094,Penny,Fine. Why don’t you pick out what you like.
22095,Sheldon,It’s the same amount of work no matter how fast you go basic physics.
22096,Penny,Also today we have a fresh caught Alaska salmon and that’s served with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice. Our soup of the day…
22097,Leonard,Who knows what he has down there.
22098,Raj,But I have a cream sherry hangover and I smell blintzes.
22099,Sheldon,I assure you I do.
22100,Raj,But I can’t have one.
22101,Howard,And I really can’t let that happen or the girl who does my eyebrows will think I’ve been cheating on her.
22102,Raj,What kind of scientist are you? Everyone knows you got to make two out of three.
22103,Raj,Hang on.
22104,Penny,Oh you poor baby.
22105,Leonard,You know how easily I blister.
22106,Leonard,I’m covered.
22107,Raj,Well that’s hard to hear but I’ll still take you back.
22108,Penny,Well you don’t know that.
22109,Leonard,Glaringly obvious. Go on.
22110,Penny,No it means a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. I’m not overly conservative. I’m young so my guy said I can afford to take some risks.
22111,Leonard,Well if you had a physical relationship I’d say propose during sex. Turns out that’s a real mood killer.
22112,Sheldon,You’re a natural at this Penny. And as the first beta testers you two’ll have quite the edge when we play with Wolowitz and Koothrappali on Sunday.
22114,Penny,You know what? Forget it. I never should’ve brought it up.
22115,Sheldon,Oh good grief. This isn’t about you. Coming! Now listen one of the great minds of the 21st century is about to play host to one of the other great minds of the 21st century. So pay attention. Years from now my biographer might ask you about this event.
22116,Sheldon,Dayaj’a’ 
22117,Leonard,Are you suggesting another bout of stress release.
22118,Raj,Do you know any mining songs?
22119,Leonard,Really? You would have slept with me after a three-hour documentary on dams?
22120,Raj,What?
22121,Howard,Well I want information in order to improve myself.
22122,Raj,Nice close up by the way.
22123,Howard,I believe you two have prepared vows?
22124,Raj,We can split it two two and two.
22125,Sheldon,But look an optical transient.
22126,Raj,To a white guy born here no. If you are a brown guy whose name has a lot of syllables in it terrifying.
22127,Howard,Well if you’re not comfortable staying here Sheldon…
22128,Howard,Well I am an astrophysicist and a lot of that takes place at night. When there are vampires and miscellaneous undead out and about.
22129,Penny,A hundred.
22130,Leonard,Interesting that you would bring that up when I might go work on a boat.
22131,Howard,Stu the cockatoo?
22132,Leonard,You?
22133,Leonard,Hey Stuart.
22134,Penny,Just as challenging as you?
22136,Leonard,I thought you were reading.
22137,Sheldon,It’s basically everything I’ve ever owned. Um every book every tee shirt every piece of broken electronics. Just all of it.
22138,Penny,Honey it’s Christmas Eve. Who even knows you’re in there?
22139,Penny,Come on Sheldon you can’t move. Don’t you need to stay in one place so the mother ship can find you when it returns?
22140,Penny,Oh my God.
22141,Howard,I don’t know what time their plane gets in but let me let me shoot them a text.
22142,Howard,Excuse me. Oh it’s my assistant Trevor. Go for Koothrappali. Uh-huh.
22143,Sheldon,Thank you. Yeah I’ve learned something today. You and I in so many ways other than intelligence and what counts we’re the same. 
22144,Raj,Though if you did it’s more zeroes than you’re expecting.
22145,Howard,Since when?
22146,Sheldon,It’s part of an unlikely scenario that involves sleepwalking and a 24-hour flower mart with a less-than-vigilant proprietor. Oh Lord my belly!
22147,Raj,Yeah me neither. It should be about the work. And if I can’t get tenure I’d like to see you or Sheldon get it.
22148,Howard,Seriously you don’t even have to stop the car. Anything under ten miles an hour and I can combat-roll into the street.
22149,Penny,Really? Even during allergy season when he has to alternate between kissing and breathing?
22150,Penny,Well why?
22151,Sheldon,Thank you.
22152,Leonard,It’s actually pretty neat.
22153,Raj,That’s right. She’s with us. Guys like that are so pathetic.
22154,Penny,Mm-hmm.
22155,Penny,Oh my God Sheldon the genius is jealous of Leonard.
22156,Penny,You know well I’m happy Leonard’s found someone. Not that anybody asked.
22157,Sheldon,Then it is no longer a dumpling once you cut it open it is at best a very small open faced sandwich.
22158,Sheldon,Ah seeing as I’m on vacation a pina colada seems appropriate. Extra pineapple slices extra whipped cream extra cherries extra umbrellas and uh hold the rum. Don’t let me have too many of those.
22159,Penny,No no. I’m gonna cheer you up. Here we go.
22160,Sheldon,Water. Neat. With a little umbrella.
22161,Howard,Don’t yell at me!
22162,Penny,Oh. How’d he do?
22163,Leonard,Un-unravelable?
22164,Penny,Well how much do you owe? Maybe I can help you out.
22165,Sheldon,Oh Penny I’m trying to take an interest in other people. Uh how was your girls’ night?
22166,Leonard,He’s coming too.
22167,Leonard,Well that’s Leo. Hey um why don’t you tell me about your showcase last night?
22168,Leonard,Now about that second proposal. On the one hand…
22169,Sheldon,Hold that thought! Professor Hawking has made a move. Boy oh boy. Oh it’s only a matter of time before we’re coming up with fun nicknames for each other. I’ll be Coop. He’ll be Wheels. If he’s okay with that. 
22170,Sheldon,I need to use the restroom.
22171,Leonard,Yeah it’s weird.
22172,Howard,Uh excuse me.
22173,Sheldon,Thank you Kripke for depriving me of the opportunity to share my news with my friends.
22174,Leonard,This one does and you’re the reason why.
22175,Leonard,Oh sure. Please join us.
22176,Penny,Why?
22177,Sheldon,What do you mean?
22178,Leonard,Really? Did he say why?
22179,Penny,Really? ‘Cause this morning at Starbucks a pair of old underwear fell out of my pant leg. And it wasn’t the only one in there.
22180,Leonard,Are you crazy? How can you put Michael Keaton in front of Christian Bale?
22181,Raj,Since you two are gonna be around for Valentine’s would you mind watching Cinnamon?
22182,Leonard,Two for thirty. And you come to my birthday party.
22183,Leonard,I don’t believe this.
22184,Penny,Are you high?
22185,Penny,Hm. At least he took an interest.
22186,Howard,If you were me would you kiss her?
22187,Leonard,Fine. I’ll take him for shoes next Saturday.
22188,Leonard,He tried to take nude photos of you?
22189,Raj,Boy you cannot catch a break can you?
22190,Howard,But you made the garage sound so fun.
22191,Leonard,Seen it.
22192,Sheldon,In what universe is this low-pulp? Good morning Penny.
22193,Leonard,Uh I guess I am.
22194,Sheldon,Yeah but he had will haven’t placed it!
22195,Raj,Marking the star positions and physical landmarks so we can find the house of the supermodels.
22196,Raj,That’s what you’re wearing.
22197,Penny,Nevertheless we are….
22198,Sheldon,Well Leonard I think it’s high time you and I address the tweepadock in the room.
22199,Leonard,Alright well get some rest and drink plenty of fluids.
22200,Leonard,I said no.
22201,Leonard,I don’t know. The bisexual gorilla go-go dancer in Schindler’s List is tough to beat.
22202,Sheldon,Well first of all I’m quite fond of Amy.
22203,Penny,Yeah she said she hasn’t heard from you in a week. I thought you liked her?
22204,Leonard,I’m trying. Don’t yell at me.
22205,Sheldon,I’m never silly. Here.
22206,Leonard,Have a nice night.
22207,Leonard,Sheldon what you need to do is figure out a way to exact vengeance on Kripke like uh like how the Joker got back at Batman for putting him in the Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane.
22208,Leonard,Oh. Pass.
22209,Sheldon,Given how much time you spend engaging in pointless self-abuse you might consider just this once using your genitalia to actually accomplish something!
22210,Raj,Okay now I just need to make sure I have a Lalita before I meet the grasshopper. It’s a sweet green miracle.
22211,Sheldon,Let me help you. L. E. O. N.
22212,Sheldon,So was the man who owned the local liquor store. He cried and cried.
22213,Sheldon,How could there be a double blind study who would be the control group.
22214,Sheldon,You talk about if werewolves can swim? See Leonard says yes but I say it depends on if the human could swim before he was bitten. What do you think?
22215,Sheldon,Agreed.
22216,Penny,No that’s silk. Seriously what would you do without me?
22217,Leonard,What?
22218,Leonard,That’s great try to set up something for the three of us to go over there.
22219,Leonard,Sheldon would you be prepared on a non-precedential basis to create an emergency ad-hoc Slurpie-Icee equivalency?
22220,Leonard,Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
22221,Sheldon,My fever is gone my sinuses are pressure-free and my mucus is as clear as a Yosemite waterfall.
22222,Sheldon,Well usually I’m on the team that picks last. Unless there’s a kid in a wheelchair.
22223,Penny,Yeah he’s as real as the fine I get when I use too much toilet paper.
22224,Howard,When you come back to Earth in a Soyuz capsule you free-fall from space at 500 miles per hour and the only thing that slows you down is a little parachute that pops out right before you crash into the ground. And the whole thing was designed by the same brilliant minds who were unable to capture Rocky and Bullwinkle.
22225,Penny,And you thought a good time to bring this up be right after sex.
22226,Howard,Smooth.
22228,Howard,Anyway it’s a beautiful time of year. Uh you travel through the vineyards. There’s a tasting on board. And all the wild flowers are in bloom. It’s magic.
22229,Howard,Mm yeah. Those are both toughies.
22230,Raj,You might be bound by them right now.
22231,Penny,Leonard you are so great. Why can’t all guys be like you?
22232,Penny,Missy?
22234,Sheldon,Thank you for driving me to work.
22235,Howard,Oh oh uh looks like they’re getting ready to let people in.
22236,Sheldon,No. I have people for that now. You’re up.
22237,Sheldon,Very well. Oh boy. 
22238,Leonard,Oh.
22239,Howard,Gentlemen have you come to the realization that the only reasonable course of action is to sell the ring and divide the money?
22240,Raj,They put you under for a cleaning?
22241,Raj,Okay I think I got it. 
22242,Howard,I’m not done but thank you.  I think back to all the good times we had like uh when we went camping and spent that night telling each other all our secrets. I told him I’m addicted to pedicures and he told me he lost his virginity to his cousin.
22243,Sheldon,Well it’s not exactly a plan but I think I’m going to pass out.
22245,Sheldon,What is it now Mrs. Wolowitz?
22247,Leonard,Ask him.
22248,Leonard,I paid two hundred dollars for my share.
22249,Penny,Hey so I saw a movie trailer the other day. How could Batman possibly fight Superman? I mean isn’t that dumb?
22250,Leonard,I am not pushing anything.
22251,Sheldon,I’m the proud owner of Wil Wheaton stinks dot com dot net and dot org. What does that tell you?
22253,Leonard,Mimesis?
22254,Sheldon,Yes.
22255,Leonard,Or a real Batman. Hey Stuart? Didn’t you try to get Adam West to do a signing here once?
22256,Penny,Oh please let me tell him.
22257,Leonard,I’m telling you Sheldon cares for you more than you think.
22258,Sheldon,No no no. Star Trek V has specific failures in writing and direction while Star Trek I fails across the board art direction costuming music sound editing.
22259,Leonard,Sure.
22260,Sheldon,Considering the number of transgressions you’ve committed that he’s overlooked don’t you think that just this once you could return the favour?
22261,Sheldon,Okay.
22262,Penny,What? He’s loving it?
22263,Leonard,Hmm.
22264,Sheldon,Yes. I believe our relationship now is stronger than ever.
22265,Sheldon,Not my fault. You said there’d be other scientists there my age.
22266,Sheldon,I’ll begin. Uh I can’t spy with my little eye something passing right through us.
22267,Raj,You guys are really being calm about Penny and Sheldon doing this thing. If it were me I’d I’d be a little nervous.
22269,Raj,No no I’m just pointing out that you’re dark on the inside and I’m dark on the outside.
22270,Leonard,Hey Penny I just wanted to say good luck and I hope there’s no hard feelings.
22271,Howard,But she did dump you.
22272,Penny,No this isn’t fair to you Leonard. I’m sorry.
22273,Leonard,You should visit more often. What are you doing?
22274,Raj,It’s a good sign.
22275,Raj,Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee.
22276,Sheldon,Leonard takes Los Robles Avenue.
22277,Howard,Hey.
22278,Sheldon,Well it’s your word against mine; see you in court.
22279,Leonard,Cheers.
22280,Raj,Oh good because she also walks my dog buys my groceries and cuts my hair.
22281,Penny,Amy’s right. I do want to fling my poop at her.
22282,Penny,Well it’s super cute on. That top has paid for itself in free drinks like ten times what it cost.
22283,Sheldon,Yes there are.
22284,Raj,That’s called a fashion choice.
22285,Sheldon,I got a splinter.
22286,Leonard,And that didn’t bother you?
22287,Penny,Public nudity?
22288,Leonard,Wait wait wait. When did you send my mom notes on a paper?
22289,Sheldon,What do you mean!?
22290,Leonard,You know what I’m going to go back and try talking to her again.
22291,Sheldon,Hey Los Angeles. I’m on a Ferris Wheel with Darth Vader. And he’s nicer than you think.
22292,Sheldon,I’ve never knocked on my own door before. That was a wild ride.
22293,Sheldon,Okay. But anything I put on now is only going to suffer in comparison.  This is absurd. I look like a clown.
22294,Sheldon,Please. What if there’s a big breakthrough in science today and I’m not there to see it?
22295,Raj,I guess it didn’t go well.
22296,Penny,I can’t believe I felt bad for opening this in the car.
22297,Sheldon,Well yes of course he wouldn’t like that at all. Last night I was feeling in need of sexual release when I happened to come across your mother.
22298,Penny,Hey have you read the online reviews for this place?
22299,Penny,Okay well what’s the third option?
22300,Penny,I thought we said in the car no accents?
22301,Howard,I’m not a virgin Sheldon.
22302,Leonard,Told you.
22303,Penny,Okay.
22304,Penny,Oh I’ll go. I like a party.
22305,Leonard,No I have to go pick him up. Bill Nye ditched him at the smoothie place.
22306,Sheldon,Did you know that Los Angeles has a Little Sri Lanka?
22307,Leonard,It’s kind of like the Loch Ness monster. Maybe there’s something there maybe there isn’t. We’ll probably never know. But sometimes it’s fun to creep yourself out thinking about it.
22308,Sheldon,I’m returning this stuff to Howard.
22309,Raj,What are you eating?
22310,Leonard,I did. It was right here. She must’ve… Oh my God we’re living together.
22311,Sheldon,I found it. The ring is mine. I don’t understand why in this group I never get my way.
22313,Sheldon,Thanks again for taking me to the pharmacy.
22314,Sheldon,It was said that the Gods fashioned her eyes out of the stars and that roses were ashamed to bloom in the presence of her ruby lips.
22315,Sheldon,Thank you for walking me home.
22317,Sheldon,I’ll go as high as 40.
22318,Sheldon,They didn’t mention you in the article. Only me.
22320,Penny,Robert Downey Jr.
22321,Howard,What’s with the gloves?
22323,Sheldon,Prescription or non-prescription strength.
22324,Sheldon,Oh well thank you. Welcome aboard.
22325,Leonard,Listen Sheldon this is stupid. I don’t see why we can’t be friends. And I’m willing to drive you around and help you out with stuff. I just don’t want to do it because of some silly roommate agreement.
22326,Leonard,Yes.
22327,Leonard,She asked me to do her a favour Sheldon.
22328,Raj,Hey dude Trent just checked in at the coffee shop on Fair Oaks.
22329,Penny,Oh hi! I was just dropping off a cheesecake to Sheldon. He was robbed of a bunch of imaginary crap that’s useful in a make-believe place.
22330,Penny,Yeah.
22331,Sheldon,I don’t like this at all.
22332,Leonard,Yes. There I said it.
22333,Sheldon,Leonard you’re being selfish. We need to give you a proper send-off so we’ll have closure when you die at sea and crabs eat your face.
22334,Penny,Yeah I kind of want to do it again.
22335,Sheldon,Then take away his keys and make him wander the streets with the other drunks.
22336,Sheldon,Well there’s Leonard.  And he’s either with Lesley Winkle or a 1930’s gangster.
22337,Raj,Howard listen to me. You’re a great husband. Yes your listening skills could use some work. But it’s amazing how far you’ve come given that you’re an only child raised by an over-protective mom.
22338,Penny,You know and then he just goes and has to humiliate me by writing about me on his blog so the entire world can read it.
22339,Sheldon,But if I’m a professor then I’ll have to teach a class.
22340,Leonard,Was it out of respect that you didn’t tell Raj about the time you dropped his iPhone in a urinal?
22341,Leonard,Huh! Sorry!
22342,Raj,What? I don’t need science to win her heart. I have my family’s wealth for that.
22343,Howard,I say we begin with a classic Star Trek fight scene.
22344,Sheldon,I sense I may have crossed some sort of line.
22345,Leonard,What are you trying to tell me Howard?
22346,Sheldon,I will yield.
22347,Sheldon,God no.
22348,Howard,Ah yes online gaming addiction. There’s nothing worse than having that multi-player monkey on your back.
22349,Penny,What?
22350,Sheldon,I could eat.
22351,Sheldon,Right these theatres have to be eliminated.
22352,Leonard,So do I get breakfast in bed on Leonard’s Day?
22353,Howard,Good riddle huh?
22354,Sheldon,Oh you’re not. You look awful.
22355,Penny,Look I’m telling you I’ve known you for like a year and a half and this is the first time I feel like I’m talking to a real person. And you know what? I like him he’s a nice guy.
22356,Sheldon, Leonard.
22357,Leonard,Couple of weirdos. Why?
22358,Raj,I’m in a hot tub with you so pretty bad.
22359,Penny,Whu… the entire weekend? You mean I wouldn’t see you at all? But I ju… No no I knew what I was getting into. You can’t put a saddle on Leonard Hofstadter. Oh my is it getting hot in here? Ay papi.
22360,Howard,Does he sound like a criminal?
22361,Raj,Oh Emily ran back to the hospital so I’m just hanging out at her place. What are you uh what are you doing?
22362,Sheldon,Waterfalls!
22363,Leonard,It doesn’t?
22364,Raj,That’s good quality video.
22365,Penny,Or you’re the frog who’s been kissed by a princess and turned into a prince.
22366,Leonard,Oh God.
22367,Howard,Nothing nothing.
22368,Sheldon,Of course the ideal way to conduct this experiment would be with four pairs of identical Sheldons and Amys. One pair that was neither dating nor living together. One pair that was dating but not living together. One pair that was living together but not dating. And then of course one pair that was living together and dating. Although with that many Sheldons it’d be such a party we’d never get anything done.
22369,Penny,What’s the matter?
22370,Penny,So what did you get the birthday boy?
22371,Howard,It’s going to be okay.
22372,Penny,You know what flash your lights. Let him know it’s you.
22373,Sheldon,Aren’t you going to ask me if I want a beverage?
22374,Raj,Wait doesn’t anyone have a rod of resurrection? Because if you’ve got one I need it bad. Get in here with your rod and give it to me.
22375,Howard,I’m not being a child. Leonard I swear to God if your sister ever comes to town I shall have my way with her.
22376,Sheldon,Patience patience Barry. The whaffle… the raffle is the grand finale to an evening-long festival of fun and folly.
22377,Sheldon,Don’t answer that. It’s a trick question. I speak from experience.
22378,Howard,I never said that.
22379,Sheldon,You can’t know that. How can you possibly know that?
22380,Sheldon,Then this is the perfect time to launch a blog with an interactive comments section.
22381,Raj,Look Howard you’re in a relationship. You know you have to make compromises.
22382,Sheldon,Yeah wait here. For your troubles.
22383,Penny,Oh right right the blog.
22384,Raj,Okay that sounds good.
22385,Sheldon,What’s life without whimsy?
22386,Raj,Hey we’re going to Oliver’s house to see his collection. You want to go with us?
22387,Penny,Thank you.
22388,Leonard,Six thirty.
22389,Raj,Where?
22390,Raj,I’m not too shy and passive. You write her back and tell her I said that. You know when you have a second.
22391,Howard,Hmm. I’m gonna give you the same advice I yell at the TV when the Bachelor’s handing out roses. Follow your heart.
22392,Penny,What else can you do? Move back in with him?
22393,Leonard,I’m not saying it was bad I’m just saying it… wasn’t great.
22394,Sheldon,What?
22395,Howard,Oh yeah. This is one good-looking panini.
22396,Sheldon,Okay.
22397,Penny,Oh I just didn’t know if you meant me or Alex.
22398,Raj,Dude! I put that thing on my face!
22399,Penny,Oh no Amy I haven’t done anything.
22400,Howard,Uh making sure the telescope’s camera is white-field balanced.
22401,Sheldon,Oh this again? So Penny proposed you didn’t say yes and now you think you may have lost her love forever. How does this compare to me being forced to relax for a few days?
22402,Leonard,New neighbour?
22403,Penny,I’m gonna show you how we finish a quest in Nebraska. Oh. Beyonce.  This ain’t no Beyonce.
22404,Leonard,This has to mean something.
22406,Sheldon,No.
22407,Sheldon,Woman you are playing with forces beyond your ken.
22408,Howard,You don’t have to bite my head off.
22409,Howard,I have a card for emergencies that I pay for myself.
22410,Sheldon,Yes.
22411,Sheldon,It’s like I’m living in a dictatorship. You must take a vacation you must have fun you must enjoy life.
22412,Howard,As with my father I both love and fear it.
22413,Penny,No it’s okay.
22414,Raj,Five million three hundred eighteen thousand and eight?
22415,Sheldon,She’s right as long as you’re vomiting coitus is contra-indicated.
22416,Penny,Aren’t you worried you’re making French toast on oatmeal day?
22417,Sheldon,Eh most of the Jenga pieces are missing and the Scrabble only has seven tiles so unless you want to build an unimpressive structure with the word shnerpf next to it move on.
22418,Penny,Creepy Howard.
22419,Sheldon,Hello.
22421,Sheldon,All right are you familiar with the development that resulted from Honoré Blanc’s 1778 use of interchangeable parts? The assembly line of course.
22422,Howard,Hey look at this. 20 people from the university have already signed up for our private beta.
22423,Raj,You know what? Even though I don’t have a girlfriend I can still have a good time on Valentine’s Day.
22424,Penny,So what do you want to do now?
22425,Leonard,Nothing.
22426,Raj,Oh please you weigh 80 pounds. You don’t have a hammy.
22427,Howard,A little loud dude.
22428,Leonard,You know before you got all swollen up I actually thought you were trying to keep me out of the apartment so you could throw me a surprise party.
22429,Howard,What suddenly I’m not good enough for you?
22430,Penny,Once? Who got the gum out of his hair?
22432,Penny,Any follow up Amy?
22433,Sheldon,Yes. So much so that I started to panic.
22434,Howard,Did you get a Japanese love pillow?
22435,Raj,Halfway is 600 miles off the coast of Japan.
22436,Penny,Well there must be a hell of a storm somewhere.
22437,Leonard,He does raise an interesting point.
22438,Sheldon,That’s not very nice.
22439,Leonard,It’s actually a pretty simple process. You see cyanoacrylate are monomers which polymerize on… 
22440,Leonard,You and I could still go and have a nice weekend.
22441,Sheldon,I know how to get the bucket! I can turn the axe around and use the handle to reach it. Let’s see. Go north. You are in a forest. Go north. You are in a forest. Go north. You are in a forest. Oh dear I believe I’m lost. Well I’ll just have to get a fresh start tomorrow.
22442,Sheldon,Oh get this. I get to take a test based on a 125-page manual. I get to learn things like hand signals. Ooh. There’s forward uh reverse set the brakes. Are you done yet? You’re missing
22443,Leonard,No.
22444,Sheldon,That’s a wise policy. I once borrowed my sister’s makeup for a costume contest. Got a terrible case of pinkeye. But luckily I was going as a zombie. I won second place.
22445,Sheldon,My new computer came with Windows 7. Windows 7 is much more user-friendly than Windows Vista. I don’t like that.
22446,Penny,Let me get my cockamamie keys.
22447,Sheldon,Well look who thinks he’s Stuart’s uncle now.
22448,Leonard,What is going on?
22449,Howard,Come on let’s get a drink.
22450,Leonard,I I’m sorry? You make compromises for me?
22451,Raj,Bernadette remember your character’s the healer in our group. You’re in charge of healing all of us not just Howard.
22452,Leonard,I  want to get to know Penny’s friends I just I don’t know how to talk to these people.
22453,Sheldon,When I was little my sister would say to me close your eyes you’ll get a surprise and then she’d punch me.
22454,Leonard,Did I do something? I mean I tried to be friends with Zack like you said which believe me was difficult given how you and me used to be you know you and me and now you and him are you and him.
22455,Howard,If you people think this is better than Tom Hanks-giving you’re all crazy.
22456,Howard,Guys they’re gonna sell out.
22457,Leonard,Me neither. Except for one night when the heat went out. Long story it’s… don’t ask.
22458,Sheldon,Don’t tell him that tell him the mask thing.
22459,Penny,Yeah that’s pretty good.
22460,Sheldon,You’re leaving?
22461,Raj,What about the guy on the Channel Four News? You know Four on Your Side? Maybe he can be on your side.
22462,Sheldon,Well yes but I found it in the box and the laws of maritime salvage clearly state that the finder of a sunken treasure is the owner of the treasure.
22463,Sheldon,You don’t see it do you? We’re losing her.
22464,Leonard,What’s the bright side?
22465,Leonard,Well n-no hold on a second I’m not going to sleep with her.
22466,Penny,That is so funny. I never would have pegged you for a Pisces.
22467,Penny,Well then what do you recommend?
22468,Leonard,Whoa! What do you mean all?
22469,Sheldon,Your anger’s not with me sir but with basic mathematics.
22470,Raj,Hey when you got home today complaining that you felt sick from eating too many jelly beans did I tell you how to fix it? No. I said aw that must hurt and I rubbed your belly.
22471,Howard,Oh. Sorry sorry uh okay.  I mean yeah maybe.
22472,Raj,Oh. I always thought if I had a white name it would be Gavin.
22474,Howard,Yeah he’s over it that’s why he’s been whining all day about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from Men in Black.
22475,Sheldon,Twenty feet twenty light years it doesn’t matter. It’s in a galaxy far far away.
22476,Leonard,I don’t know.
22477,Leonard,Yeah.
22478,Penny,It won’t happen again what’s up?
22479,Leonard,Where?
22480,Howard,Well excuse me I don’t think Penny’s out of line at all. You don’t own her. It’s like my girl Beyonce says if you like it you shoulda put a ring on it.”
22481,Leonard,I know you won’t look why would you look there’s nothing to see well not nothing….
22482,Penny,Yeah.
22483,Raj,Ah I’m making a necklace for my mom.
22484,Leonard,Because rock breaks scissors goodnight.
22485,Raj,Are you sure you can do this?
22486,Raj,Everything okay?
22487,Leonard,Yeah good. New contacts. I should have done this years ago.
22488,Leonard,What?
22489,Penny,Oh my God you still go left.
22490,Howard,What is your mother going to say?
22491,Sheldon,Please fright depends on an element of surprise. The simple fact is because I am much smarter than you and able to anticipate your actions it is highly unlikely that you two rubes could ever surprise me. 
22492,Howard,How did that work out?
22493,Penny,She’s not my friend. Friends do not get their friends care bears all sweaty.
22495,Sheldon,At the hot dog stand in the Denver train station Heinz ketchup. At the hot dog stand in the Salt Lake City train station Heinz ketchup. At the hot dog stand in the Indianapolis train station?
22496,Leonard,Then what happens?
22497,Leonard,Sheldon.
22498,Sheldon,According to an online message board I may be having a panic attack. SoccerMom09 had similar symptoms. But to be fair the twins were a real handful that day.
22499,Sheldon,Oh thanks you’re a peach. Beverly we’ll catch up soon. Bernadette it was a pleasure as always Penny you have spinach in your teeth.
22500,Leonard,I’m androgynous?
22501,Sheldon,I just got called into President Siebert’s office. The university won’t let me switch my field of study to inflationary cosmology. They’re forcing me to continue with string theory.
22502,Sheldon,And you’ll text me when you arrive at the airport?
22503,Penny,Wow it looks really pretty in here.
22504,Penny,Okay we just want to say we feel really bad about…
22505,Penny,Hey Sheldon you’re always full of fun little facts. Where did the expression got your ass handed to you come from?
22506,Sheldon,Click. Now are there air bags?
22507,Leonard,Sheldon lives in fear of the three-tined fork.
22508,Sheldon,What do you want me to do?
22509,Howard,Still my first choice for an ankle tattoo. Or a dolphin I go back and forth.
22510,Leonard,No one’s a scientist like Howard.
22511,Howard,Good. Sheldon’s out of town so we can do whatever we want. We even ordered from the Thai place he doesn’t like.
22512,Howard,You look like a jackass.
22513,Sheldon,No he doesn’t understand. I understand.
22514,Leonard,Well answer it. I want to hear.
22515,Leonard,No you should. Absolutely. That was me being pedantic. That’s our first bug. You reported it. I can fix that. See? This is good.
22516,Sheldon,Wait. Not yet. We still have to go over safety procedures. Now the apartment has three emergency exits located here here and here. In the event of a power outage luminous paint will guide you to the nearest exit.
22517,Raj,I’m not telling. I’m from Asia. I’m mysterious. Deal with it.
22518,Penny,Aw that’s so weird.
22519,Sheldon,Well I can’t take all the credit. It was pretty funny when that one anchovy started going the wrong way.
22520,Leonard,You’re right. I’m-I’m-I’m-I’m sorry I’m way out of line!
22521,Raj,Oh come on.
22522,Sheldon,Oh. Thank you.
22523,Sheldon,Howard I have a few questions. I found three bowling pins. Now do you juggle these or are you missing seven?
22524,Leonard,No you’re not sanding Penny.
22525,Sheldon,I don’t know why you’re so surprised. I watch movies I see what people do.
22526,Penny,It’s six thirty in the morning.
22527,Sheldon,It’s getting clearer.
22528,Penny,Oh not really. I was out shopping with Amy. She wanted me to help her find something for this memorial thing.
22529,Sheldon,If you’re interested I also know all about frying meat that isn’t chicken as if it were chicken.
22530,Penny,That’s so hot.
22531,Penny,I didn’t feel a draft.
22532,Raj,But this isn’t about the jewellery. This is about me having a place where I can open up about my feelings.
22533,Sheldon,Okay then riddle me this. Assuming all the good Terminators were originally evil Terminators created by Skynet but then reprogrammed by the future John Connor why would Skynet an artificial computer intelligence bother to create a petite hot 17 year-old killer robot?
22534,Raj,What?
22535,Leonard,Yeah I uh went for a drink.
22537,Howard,Isabella.
22539,Leonard,How ya doing?
22540,Howard,Well then why didn’t you say that to her?
22541,Penny,Would it help?
22542,Leonard,You’re kidding why not?
22543,Raj,What is wrong with you Penny? You ruined any chance I had of getting back with Lucy. Now she knows I’m a desperate mess instead of just being pretty sure.  It’s Lucy. She wants to meet for coffee. I love you Penny.
22544,Penny,But wait. So does this one.
22545,Sheldon,Ah. So it is. I guess we both share blame on this one.
22546,Sheldon,Yeah I hate wedding receptions. I wish the bride and groom would take a cue from Bilbo Baggins slip on the ring disappear and everyone goes home.
22547,Penny,Yeah.
22548,Raj,Oh I’m sorry. I’ll leave.
22549,Sheldon,Vexillology is… why is there a face on that flag?
22550,Sheldon,Uh extra peanut sauce?
22551,Raj,See? This is exactly the kind of thing I’m worried about you saying in front of her.
22552,Penny,What happened?
22553,Raj,But I just broke up with my girlfriend.
22554,Sheldon,Well you know here is something that might cheer you up. The flag of the Isle of Man is nothing but three legs sharing a weird pair of underpants so you think you got problems.
22555,Sheldon,Oh please if influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear it would have died out thousands of years ago. Somewhere between tool using and cave painting homo habilus would have figured out to kill the guy with the runny nose.
22556,Howard,Dude my parents just split up.
22558,Penny,What? Here give me give me. Oh my God. Oh my God they’re coming right towards us.
22559,Leonard,No cilantro?
22560,Sheldon,So?
22561,Howard,Okay so not her either. How about her?
22562,Leonard,Right.
22563,Penny,Oh sweetie it’s okay. 
22564,Raj,What were you doing with Priya?
22565,Sheldon,Oh thank you Penny.
22566,Sheldon,You’re welcome. Good night to you too. Oh by the way I was watching you sleep for a moment and I noticed that your snoring seems to be worse when you’re on your back.
22567,Penny,Sheldon!
22568,Raj,Fine. I will melt her heart. And her face.
22569,Sheldon,Okay. Shall we go to dinner?
22570,Howard,But I was summing up.
22571,Leonard,When you tell this story later the word we usually use is quirky.
22572,Leonard,Uh okay let’s pretend you do have a problem.
22573,Howard,Yeah it was. But it’s my father’s money and I’m mad at him.
22574,Leonard,Ah don’t. If they didn’t want to be yelled at by crazy nerds they shouldn’t have started a sci-fi channel.
22575,Leonard,Actually ethyl alcohol inhibits electrical conduction in the nerve cells and stimulates reuptake receptors of inhibitory neurotransmitters like gamma-aminobutyric acid.
22576,Leonard,The glass is empty Sheldon. It’s completely empty. If you gave that glass to a man who was dying of thirst he would be dead do you know why?
22577,Sheldon,Congratulations. Zack how would you like to be Superman?
22578,Howard,Please wait until I get into the hall.
22579,Sheldon, Leonard.
22580,Leonard,Right right. So you’re still just texting and emailing? You don’t feel any need to hang out with her you know be in the same room?
22581,Howard,And we made it in only three hours. Sounds just like store-bought.
22582,Sheldon,The original title was “A Rederivation of Maxwell’s Equations Regarding Electromagnetism”” I dumbed it down because some of the more religious people in town were starting to say I was a witch.
22583,Sheldon,Oh I’m not buying anything. They’re having a lecture. H-O gauge railroading. Half the size of O-gauge but twice the fun. Very controversial topic.
22584,Leonard,Oh that’s great.
22585,Leonard,Just ignore him.
22586,Sheldon,I’m not taking you anywhere till you put on a shirt.
22587,Raj,Did you get a cold too?
22588,Sheldon,You know why this hamburger surpasses the Big Boy? This is a single decker hamburger whereas the Big Boy is a double decker. This has a much more satisfying meat to bun to condiment ratio.
22589,Howard,He lied about the cream cheese. He ate the whole thing. I saw him.
22590,Penny,So how do you want me to cut it?
22591,Penny,Oh hey. Did you see that? I I figured out how to open the door all by myself. Maybe I’ll fling some faeces around my cage to celebrate.
22592,Howard,Cool. Can I say it fell apart because you were all I want to have your babies and I was like I’m too rock and roll to be tied down?
22593,Sheldon,No it’s fine. Now I can devote all my time to dark matter.
22594,Howard,Come on dude you’re being too hard on yourself. You’ve got a lot of good stuff going on.
22595,Sheldon,Oh! I see the confusion here. No no Alex thought I was singling her out. No. I meant that all women are slaves to their biological urges you know? Even you. You’re a slave.
22596,Raj,Boy what I wouldn’t give to get her out of those pants and into something a little more stylish.
22597,Leonard,I thought maybe after we eat we could see an early movie.
22598,Penny,Bye.
22599,Sheldon,Don’t be absurd. That’s in Washington. You know I could never live in a city whose streets are laid out in a wheel-and-spoke pattern. No. I’m going to find a similarly menial job where my basal ganglia are occupied with a routine task freeing my prefrontal cortex to work quietly in the background on my problem.
22600,Penny,Whatever I’ll figure it out myself.
22601,Leonard,She’s not going to steal our idea.
22602,Raj,It’s not superstition. It’s practically Newtonian. For every action there’s an equal and opposite reaction. Leonard pretends to be a friend and acts like a two-faced bitch therefore he is reborn as a banana slug. It’s actually a very elegant system you know what goes around comes around.
22603,Leonard,Good night Sheldon.
22604,Leonard,Yes he is.
22605,Howard,Now that I know she doesn’t like me I’m kind of into her.
22606,Howard,Chickens can’t climb trees
22607,Leonard,Was it the two women thing or the playa? It was the playa.
22608,Sheldon,If you didn’t press record…
22609,Sheldon,No no counter-clockwise or my chest hair mats.
22610,Howard,My sister.
22611,Leonard,And to show you how much I believe in you I kind of got you an audition.
22612,Sheldon,I want another one.
22613,Sheldon,Hello.
22614,Sheldon,How many pairs of underwear did you pack for the move?
22615,Penny,He still won’t shag the old lady huh?
22616,Sheldon,I’m sure you’re right. I suppose I should apologize to you as well.
22617,Penny,Uh I’m sorry do you speak English?
22618,Sheldon,All right.
22619,Sheldon,You know I felt the same way about the spork. Uh solids and liquids handled by one utensil? That’ll never work. Spoiler works.
22620,Leonard,What brought that on?
22621,Howard,It’s called being nice.
22622,Penny,Well there are the waitresses at my work and this cute little shop in Old Town.
22623,Sheldon,She doesn’t want to live with Leonard so he has to come live here again. She’s the snake in our garden. She’s the reason we can’t be happy.
22624,Raj,You know who’s got to be the bravest person in the Marvel Universe? Whoever has to give She-Hulk a bikini wax.
22625,Sheldon,I’m striking up a casual conversation with you. S’u’up?
22626,Penny,You’re really not gonna tell me?
22627,Leonard,That’s a good question.
22628,Penny,Ah okay. Let us take you off the wall. Out of sight out of mind. I wish.
22629,Sheldon,Thank you. Chocolate?
22630,Penny,Oh.
22631,Raj,You just say uh Hey Siri what time is it?
22632,Leonard,You know if no one’s thought of this yet this could be a big deal.
22633,Sheldon,Gentlemen use your imagination. Innovate. Did Han Solo let Luke Skywalker freeze to death on the ice planet of Hoth? No. He cut open a tauntaun and used its internal body heat to warm him up.
22634,Leonard,Forget the robot. What happened to you?
22635,Sheldon,What did they feed the lions Mother?
22636,Howard,Uh off. And on. And the Oprah Network. This is so much better than watching TV like a muggle.
22637,Raj,If it’s an alternate dimension sounds like a job for a landing party.
22638,Raj,What the hell is this?
22639,Sheldon,And people think I don’t get sarcasm.
22640,Raj,Except I’ll be alone.
22641,Penny,Look honey I was really drunk and made a huge mistake last night. We should’ve never slept together. It’s what ruins friendships.
22642,Howard,Hang on. Oh no. Oh no. Oh God no.
22643,Howard,I say uh how about one two three go?
22644,Penny,No he doesn’t.
22645,Leonard,Well the colonel said it was for the good of the country and the funding is substantial.
22646,Sheldon,Good. On the way to see the lawyer pick up some tea and cookies. I must say I am enjoying your new chair.
22647,Penny,Shh! It’s my agent it’s my agent. You’re kidding. Oh my gosh. I can’t believe it! Really? Oh I’m so excited thank you thank you so much. Okay bye. I got the haemorrhoid commercial! I start Monday.
22648,Sheldon,Hello.
22649,Penny,Well I’m kind of responsible for Sheldon missing Stan Lee and I really want to make it up to him. So I was hoping you could give me his phone number so maybe I can arrange for them to meet.
22650,Raj,I did shut up. Now you shut up.
22651,Raj,Uh Xbox One.
22652,Sheldon,I’m sorry who’s Angie Dickinson?
22653,Howard,What can we do?
22654,Leonard,How’s that?
22655,Howard,The guy who invented it says it’s jif.
22656,Penny,And I wanted to make you feel better so I planned something very special for you.
22657,Penny,Oh right.
22658,Howard,And it would be my pleasure to be her num-num.
22659,Penny,Hey are you still hanging out with Bernadette tonight?
22660,Penny,Fine.
22661,Leonard,Yeah.
22662,Sheldon,You keep talking like that you’re gonna make colour guard.
22663,Penny,Guys it’s hot in here I think I’ll just take off all my clothes.
22664,Leonard,I don’t want it better. I want it my way.
22665,Penny,Because it was crap. It’s a sequel to that awful killer gorilla movie I was in.
22666,Howard,Maybe it means something different in this country. Back in India it means you’re upset with a guy named Howard!
22667,Penny,Well you know it’s just that Leonard and Howard and Raj they aren’t like other guys. They’re special.
22668,Penny,Damn it everyone’s better at this than me.
22669,Sheldon,Can you go to the kitchen and get me the turkey baster labelled mucus.
22670,Raj,Ooh it’ll be like a reunion then. Sign here.
22671,Sheldon,That is my spot. In an ever-changing world it is a single point of consistency. If my life were expressed as a function on a four-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system that spot at the moment I first sat on it would be zero-zero-zero-zero.
22672,Penny,Okay.
22673,Sheldon,And that’s how you make effort look effortless.
22674,Raj,He’s right. A minute on the lips a lifetime on the hips.
22675,Raj,Fine I’ll put it on Facebook like a caveman.
22676,Sheldon,Oh Leonard. If I was prone to sarcasm I’d say I was pulling off a major heist at the museum of laundry baskets.
22677,Howard,You’re right. You realize what this means?
22678,Raj,Fine. What do one point three billion people know about having babies?
22679,Penny,Oh my God.
22682,Sheldon,Well I would imagine when your job is popping zits and squirting Botox into old lady faces…
22683,Raj,Yeah.
22684,Penny,Hi.
22685,Penny,It’s in your purse. Play.
22686,Sheldon,Leonard?
22687,Penny,He’s a sweetie.
22688,Penny,Leonard stop pressuring me.
22689,Sheldon,Yes.
22690,Leonard,Everything all right?
22691,Penny,Yeah we weren’t even out of the room that long.
22692,Sheldon,Yeah I hear you brother.
22693,Sheldon,I suppose it is. Except I have a credit card. And I refuse to carry my laptop at the end of a stick. And I’d sooner die than eat beans out of a can.
22694,Raj,Come on.
22695,Leonard,Nothing just rethinking my whole life. Okay here’s the thing I’m afraid that if I ask her to move out she’ll just dump me.
22696,Sheldon,No to wake up every morning and know you’re there is a great comfort to me. Mmm tasteless. How do you do it?
22697,Leonard,Mary I’m sorry you’re in the middle of this.
22698,Leonard,Oh good God.
22699,Leonard,Sir.
22700,Sheldon,Yes.
22701,Howard,I know. What started as a pap smear turned into a date. Which turned into her working there which turned into marriage which then turned into hatred which continues to this day. Two-Eyed Cyclops.
22702,Howard,Yeah he’s a ginormous knob.
22703,Sheldon,Did you get that?
22704,Leonard,Okay let me try it this way you’re annoying and no-one wants to play with you any more.
22705,Sheldon,But what if I’m wrong?
22706,Penny,Hey it’s a big menu. There’s two pages just for desserts.
22707,Raj,No.
22708,Sheldon,Good news. You’re an asteroid.
22709,Leonard,Air freshener.
22710,Leonard,Can I get you anything?
22711,Leonard,Remember show your work.
22712,Howard,Ooh ooh I forgot about Princess Bride. That’s my answer.
22713,Leonard,Let’s go. Okay you two just have a nice… whatever this is.
22714,Penny,Howard. Cow tipping. Real or not?
22715,Sheldon,Me too. It’s comforting to know that she and I are able to function as friends.
22716,Penny,Because it’s me going back to school and he’s gonna be all “you can do it” and “how can I help?” and “I’m so proud of you.” Ugh!
22717,Sheldon,Silence!
22718,Leonard,What? I didn’t know you had a journal.
22719,Leonard,Morning Jimmy.
22721,Raj,Tag. You’re it. 
22722,Sheldon,All right I’ve had enough. Attention everyone. I’ m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. As many of you in the physics department might know my career trajectory has taken a minor detour.
22723,Howard,This is it.
22724,Leonard,That was three weeks ago.
22725,Leonard,This is ridiculous. I’m coming to talk to you.
22726,Penny,What’s with him?
22727,Leonard,And this is me doing the Titanic pose on the boat.
22728,Raj,Come on we’re smart guys. We can figure this out.
22729,Sheldon,I can’t do this. I’m going to faint.
22730,Sheldon,Well no. Hold on. My Elven magic-user and your half-orc warrior did have a love spell cast on them. We wouldn’t really be playing the game right if we didn’t see that through.
22731,Sheldon,I have GPS on my phone. I know you turned around.
22732,Raj,No not really.
22733,Leonard,Sheldon I don’t care if you want to be friends with Penny.
22734,Penny,That’s super helpful Amy. Thanks a lot. I can’t wait to do that.
22735,Sheldon,His statements of the obvious continue to annoy.
22736,Raj,If it’s thank you for the home made jam you got in December congratulations you’re the first one.
22737,Sheldon,No no wait. Dr. Crawley are you sure?
22738,Sheldon,What am I supposed to do eat French toast on a Monday? Now that would be impossible.
22739,Penny,FYI this is a bag from Victoria’s Secret.
22740,Sheldon,Please don’t tell me that your hopeless infatuation is devolving into pointless jealousy.
22741,Sheldon,It’s not amazing. All magic tricks are merely a combination of manipulation and misdirection with the occasional dwarf in a box wiggling his feet.
22742,Sheldon,Oh-ho-ho it’s working all right. I have to pee.
22743,Leonard,Hey Sheldon?
22744,Penny,How can I not sound like his mother when our entire bedroom is filled with Star Wars toys? I mean have you ever had sex with a stuffed Wookiee watching you?
22745,Penny,Yes I do.
22746,Penny,I’m in.
22747,Sheldon,Some people are otters some people are rocks.
22748,Sheldon,So that’s how this works? I complain and then you complain and no one offers any solutions?
22749,Penny,Hey I went out with this guy TJ for eight months we never talked. To this day I don’t even know what TJ stands for.
22750,Leonard,You know I want to marry you but you’re only doing this because you got fired and you’re feeling sorry for yourself.
22751,Leonard,No I’m fine. Penny’s fine the guy she’s kissing is really fine and…
22752,Raj,… but then it turns good again and that means it’s better than if it had never been bad for a while. I know that now thing’s aren’t good they are in fact very very bad but at least my heart is starting to heal. Slowly but surely. And oh how I cried. It was like a little uh thunderstorm on my face. But I’m a man okay? So I need to pull myself together pick up a pen and get it all out in my journal. I mean it’s not all bad right? Having my heart broken has allowed me to finally speak in front of you so you know a silver lining….
22753,Sheldon,Told you.
22754,Howard,She was blowing a spit bubble. It was adorable.
22755,Leonard,Oh that’s pretty steep.
22756,Raj,He’s got him there. The D even stands for department.
22757,Sheldon,You know. Mimesis. An action in which the mimic takes on the properties of a specific object or organism. Mimesis.
22758,Raj,Okay. Here we go say cheese. Iskip) Say cheese. Iskip) Say cousin. Iskip) Say…
22759,Sheldon,All right Amy this walkie-talkie is yours. If we run into any problems I’ll contact you. And if anything bad happens what’s the rule?
22760,Sheldon,Oh I’m sorry I thought making the transition from actor to acting teacher was the signal that one’s career had reached the end of the road.
22761,Sheldon,Are you comfortable?
22762,Sheldon,Good news. Uh the latest episode of Fun with Flags is online.
22763,Leonard,Sheldon I I’m sorry if I hurt your feelings. I’ve been holding a lot of this in for a while.
22764,Sheldon,I don’t know why that surprises you. I’m a grown man. As should be evident by this sport coat and very real flower in my lapel.
22765,Leonard,Check it out. It’s the gas I use in my free-electron laser to support high voltages. But it also has an interesting secondary use. Here. Breathe this in.
22766,Penny,Hey.
22767,Sheldon,Three in the morning is a good time for bongos.
22768,Howard,And it’s about to tell my parents that I’m not riding an elephant down the aisle with Lalita Gupta.
22769,Sheldon,Oh maybe you’re right. He is kind of a lump.
22770,Sheldon,Are you sure? That would explain so much. Your constant presence in my apartment that baffling dalliance with Leonard just to be near me the way you call me sweetie all the time.
22771,Leonard,No look Mumbai Palace.
22772,Penny,Sheldon I’m sorry. I’ll be happy to reimburse you for the fine. You know as soon as I get a part in a movie or my own TV series.
22773,Penny,Last week. I’m sorry I should’ve told you. It was a spur of the moment thing. I feel terrible. Please don’t be too disappointed.
22774,Leonard,Oh gee why didn’t you say so? They don’t let just anyone have a Web site.
22775,Raj,Well you guys have no idea how hard it is to know something like this and not say it.
22776,Sheldon,Leonard we need a ruling.
22777,Howard,And an Aquaman action figure.
22778,Howard,Well you guys have no idea how hard it is to know something like this and not say it.
22779,Raj,Yes.
22780,Penny,Just keep going!
22781,Penny,Okay what just happened?
22782,Leonard,The one I gave you?
22783,Leonard,Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.
22784,Leonard,Uh y-yeah.
22785,Leonard,Ooh. Cool.
22786,Howard,I can’t date two women at once. Zero women that’s my sweet spot.
22787,Howard,So I’d like to try a technique where no one gets steamrolled. When you talk instead of bringing up a new idea respect what was just said by building on it.
22788,Sheldon,You are the living embodiment of the beautiful Princess Punchali.
22789,Sheldon,Well the Swedes might beat us but at least we won’t get gang-noogied in prison.
22790,Leonard,Thank you.
22791,Raj,I hope the bathroom is clearly marked.
22792,Penny,No.
22793,Howard,Dad I’m trying to tell you off and you’re ruining it with your delight and relief.
22794,Sheldon,Apparently figure this out on my own ’cause you guys are no help at all.
22795,Howard,Hey I plan on levelling up in the game not my swimsuit size thank you very much.
22796,Raj,Okay. How Thelma and Louise of us.
22797,Penny,It’s not an experiment! You saw what happened last night.
22798,Leonard,Yeah but now he’s gonna be up at dawn and want to play.
22799,Leonard,No.
22800,Penny,Well you’re home now.
22801,Howard,Potty is innocent. Potty is adorable.
22802,Sheldon,You’re two for two.
22803,Raj,Come on Daddy. All the other scientists have seat warmers. This is so humiliating. I’ve got to get tenure. Okay let’s meet halfway. How about I cut my cleaning lady down to twice a week? Looks like we’re both going to be living like animals.
22804,Penny,Got it.
22805,Howard,What about the money?
22806,Sheldon,Theoretical physicists do not get canned. But yeah.
22807,Howard,That’s really nice of you Howard.
22808,Leonard,Really? Silence?
22809,Leonard,Hey.
22810,Sheldon,I think I have the same one.
22811,Leonard,Well I hope it’s as much fun as the Sheldon Cooper Spell-Checks Local Menus Tour.
22812,Penny,Well I am so happy for Howard and Bernadette.
22814,Raj,I’m just being a good house guest.
22815,Leonard,Hey. We’re going to the comic book store. You want to come?
22816,Leonard,Where do you stand on it?
22817,Leonard,Howard’s space toilet. I’ll tell you later.
22818,Sheldon,I was hoping she might listen to you about the dangers of owning unhygienic furniture.
22819,Sheldon,As you wish.  Did you pick one?
22820,Leonard,No. No. Scientists do not compromise. Our minds are trained to synthesise facts and come to inarguable conclusions. Not to mention Sheldon is batcrap crazy.
22821,Sheldon,Then don’t.
22822,Penny,I guess I could serve both.
22823,Sheldon,I’m willing to if you guys are.
22824,Howard,What is wrong with you Penny? You ruined any chance I had of getting back with Lucy. Now she knows I’m a desperate mess instead of just being pretty sure.  It’s Lucy. She wants to meet for coffee. I love you Penny.
22825,Sheldon,Well of course I’m hungry. And as I have no plans to eat with any other team I will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto. Mm mm mm!
22826,Howard,My father pays for it. Do you know how much your rent is?
22827,Howard,Uh.
22828,Howard,Oh yes I I too am in the throes of heartbreak. Okay fine I’ll tell you about it.
22829,Leonard,No last time that old lady in the park kept screaming watch out he’s right behind you. Hello?
22830,Raj,Well not so much depressed as lonely.
22831,Sheldon,Who’s unsatisfactory in P.E. now?
22832,Howard,How’d you do?
22833,Raj,They used to like going to the Mumbai Symphony but last year my mom thought they were phoning it in. Then my dad said based on their love life she should know about phoning it in.
22834,Raj,Yes in the telescope room.
22835,Sheldon,‘Course she also told me that every animal in the world got on one boat so what does she know? And send.
22836,Raj,Oh cool. Can I play?
22837,Penny,What’s going on?
22838,Howard,Just bust a move
22839,Leonard,I guess the difference is I have some self-respect.
22840,Penny,Gee you think?
22841,Leonard,Whoa.
22842,Leonard,Just pick another game.
22843,Howard,It was lovely meeting you best of luck in your future endeavours.
22844,Sheldon,Melba toast?
22845,Sheldon,I read an article about Japanese scientists who inserted DNA from luminous jellyfish into other animals and I thought hey fish nightlights.
22846,Penny,Yeah.
22847,Penny,Really what were you hoping for?
22848,Sheldon,Mom I want to apologize for my behaviour last night.
22849,Howard,Let’s see. Six. That’s pretty cool I have six friends. Kind of like Sinatra.
22850,Penny,Come on really?
22851,Raj,Yeah well I know how to make your egg salad now.
22852,Leonard,So you’re not going to see her again?
22853,Leonard,Sure Dad.
22854,Penny,Look I’m telling you I’ve done it okay? I clearly remember the cow standing up and then the cow on its side.
22855,Leonard,Alright I don’t care what you say I’m going to the conference and I’m presenting our findings.
22856,Howard,Before you finish is this a story about patience and waiting or just another reminder that you went to space?
22857,Howard,Sheldon you have two choices. Either you let him put a bigger hard drive in the TiVo or you delete stuff before we go out of town.
22858,Sheldon,Buddy.
22859,Sheldon,They’re gone Penny. They can’t hear you.
22860,Sheldon,Oh I got a letter from my Meemaw. Umm. Smell this.
22861,Penny,Yes well I want a boyfriend whose roommate isn’t a giant pain in the ass.
22862,Sheldon,Grateful.
22863,Penny,Well yeah when you start a party at seven no-one shows up at you know seven.
22864,Raj,Okay uh please don’t take this the wrong way but I’d rather swim buck-naked across the Ganges with a paper cut on my nipple and die a slow agonizing death from a viral infection than work with you.
22865,Penny,Oh.
22866,Raj,Howard built a sex robot.
22867,Penny,That’s good. That’s good. That’s good.
22868,Sheldon,Leonard please. You know Amy moving in marks a level of intimacy our relationship isn’t ready for.
22869,Sheldon,Rotating.
22870,Leonard,Uh I would like to propose a toast to my wife and bride-to-be.
22871,Leonard,It really does hold up.
22872,Penny,It was. Until I fell in love with a jerk.
22873,Leonard,You would go to a beach house?
22874,Sheldon,That’s not the comforting part.
22875,Raj,What’s happening tomorrow night?
22876,Penny,Just thinking about the day I met you and Leonard.
22877,Howard,That works.
22878,Raj,Hey as long as the baby’s healthy.
22879,Sheldon,Oh! Hello.
22880,Leonard,Okay…
22881,Penny,Yeah me too.
22882,Leonard,Hey. I just wanted to let you know that I I posted my findings.
22883,Sheldon,Oh well I have a few questions for him about the last Avengers movie and a whole lot of answers.
22884,Penny,Okay okay. We get it. You set the scene.
22885,Sheldon,All right say hello to your mother for me.
22886,Leonard,Oh I give up.
22887,Sheldon,Is it wrong to say I love our killer robot?
22888,Raj,Well you’re kidding right?
22889,Howard,I wasn’t joking.
22890,Leonard,I never know what to do in these situations. Should I give him a heads-up?
22891,Leonard,Sheldon it’s fine.
22892,Sheldon,It’s perfect. It appears romantic but it’s really just a rock in space that gets me out of Valentine’s Day forever.
22893,Leonard,What do you want a medal? It was your gum.
22894,Sheldon,I’m a modern day Napoleon exiled to the Elba of the staircase because Leonard get this has a date.
22895,Penny,Just pretty good I’d think you were doing very good.
22896,Howard,And I told you he bit me.
22897,Penny,Oh well I’m an actress.
22898,Raj,Very mature. Keep eating like that you’re gonna have a heart attack.
22899,Penny,Now you’re taking her side?
22900,Sheldon,I apologize. I just I’m plagued by an internal struggle.
22901,Leonard,No absolutely not.
22902,Penny,Of course.
22903,Sheldon,Shh he said it’s interesting.
22904,Sheldon,Yes ma’am.
22905,Howard,Oh beefaroni. I think I’ll miss you most of all.
22906,Leonard,Ah. Well thank you for your time.
22907,Howard,I don’t sound like that.
22908,Raj,I’m sorry have I been complaining about it too much?
22909,Sheldon,That’s very nice Stuart. Zack?
22910,Sheldon,I question your premise. How is a new suit going to prevent me from passing out in front of a ballroom full of people?
22911,Sheldon,That’s it?
22912,Leonard,I’m dealing with a situation and it’s kind of about my love life so I know that might be weird for us to talk about but in this area as you know all my other friends are just so stupid.
22913,Sheldon,They don’t talk incessantly for no particular reason.
22914,Penny,If you want to do something you can help me fold this sheet.
22915,Penny,I remember symposium.
22916,Sheldon,Oh I’m sorry did I insult you? Is your body mass somehow tied into your self worth?
22917,Sheldon,Thank you. You hear any union talk you let me know.
22918,Penny,Are you really gonna lie on the floor and pretend to be dead all night?
22919,Sheldon,You’re my girlfriend and you’re not going to cater to my every need? Oh where’d the magic go?
22920,Raj,Sorry. Go on.
22921,Leonard,Penny thinks I’m too smart for her that’s ridiculous.
22922,Leonard,No.
22923,Sheldon,Oh it’s like I’m really there.
22924,Leonard,Stop it you’re gonna make me cry. All right. You seem pretty confident.
22925,Leonard,Are those my sheets?
22926,Penny,Okay. Um you’re Lucy right? I’m a friend of Raj Koothrappali’s. Actually Amy recognized you.
22927,Leonard,Yep
22928,Sheldon,Yes. All over it.
22929,Sheldon,It only moves in time. It would be worse than useless in a swamp.
22930,Leonard,And besides I do romantic things for you all the time. Can you even name one romantic thing you’ve done for me?
22931,Leonard,What is it?
22932,Howard,Forgive me for staring but you’re very beautiful.
22933,Sheldon,No we don’t. The one we have works great.
22934,Penny,What’s that?
22935,Leonard,Hang in there. I’ll be right back. 
22936,Sheldon,Yeah I know. It was quite tense. So here’s the million dollar question uh who wants to pop over there and get my trains?
22937,Howard,Big or small I don’t like rabbits. They always look like they’re about to say something but they never do.
22938,Leonard,Look if you want to break up just say it.
22939,Leonard,So uh what we did was in fact dating?
22940,Sheldon,I know it filled in last year. I didn’t get to spend a lot of time with you on this visit.
22941,Sheldon,Oh. I am.
22942,Leonard,Way better.
22943,Leonard,I do have to ask you one favour.
22944,Howard,Five.
22945,Sheldon,It was wonderful.
22946,Howard,Yeah of course. What else could it be? Boy do I love America.
22947,Howard,I thought someone looked brighter and tighter.
22948,Penny,What?
22949,Leonard,Sheldon? I just dropped him off at the comic book store. Why?
22950,Penny,Yeah I was gonna throw it away but I just couldn’t.
22951,Sheldon,Well there’s the difference. 
22952,Leonard,Really? Who?
22953,Sheldon,That’s not gonna work.
22954,Leonard,Look I I know this is this is change and that sounds scary.
22955,Leonard,And?
22956,Penny,We had a really nice swim.
22957,Sheldon,Well ideally an enclosed self-sustaining biodome in New Mexico where we would eat crops fertilized with our own waste.
22958,Sheldon,That’s small. So tell me do you have any plans for the weekend?
22959,Raj,Yeah to Howard. Um uh who’s next?
22960,Sheldon,That’s what tertiary friends are for.
22961,Raj,All I’m saying is there’s a time to just listen.
22962,Raj,Oh why can’t I stay mad at you?
22963,Leonard,Yeah.
22965,Penny,Fine is that how you want to play this? All right never have I ever come up with a nickname for my own genitals.
22966,Penny,I care. Oh wait no I don’t. Good luck Raj.
22967,Sheldon,Uh just a couple more items. Howard I found this letter from your dad in a box. Now based on the content it could either be filed…
22968,Sheldon,When Obi-Wan came to Luke on this very spot he gave him all sorts of helpful advice. So um what do you got for me?
22969,Raj,Sheldon you know what I think of when I’m scared? Voyager.
22970,Raj,I totally had one of those.
22971,Penny,So what did you say?
22972,Howard,Hoo-hoo-hoo. The only thing missing from that insult was “yo mamma.”
22973,Leonard,Oh no.
22974,Leonard,So Sheldon tell us about your trip. Where’d you go?
22976,Howard,Hi.
22977,Leonard,Why? What happened?
22978,Howard,You know we’re not that far from my apartment. If you stop the car I can walk from here.
22979,Leonard,You know I was thinking there are some great research facilities in India.
22980,Raj,There it is Priya. We’re Indian. We believe this stuff.
22981,Sheldon,I don’t see any way to get a park bench in here.
22982,Leonard,So Howard back Monday?
22983,Leonard,Doesn’t look happy so I’m guessing he wants to talk to Sheldon.
22984,Leonard,Fine you want to meet her?
22985,Penny,Oh. Yeah. That’s gone. It’s a rough month when Halloween and PMS hit at the same time.
22986,Sheldon,Arthur what brings you back?
22987,Howard,Uh thank you for the drink.
22988,Sheldon,I’m going to admonish you.
22989,Howard,This is my friend Bernadette. She’s pregnant and she’s a bit worried so I thought maybe you could talk to her.
22990,Sheldon,Yes and as you know I planned to pretend to enjoy it. I’ve been working on this facial expression all day.
22991,Leonard,Ready to play when you are.
22992,Penny,Yeah. Well my question is and I’m pretty sure I know the answer is this your first date?
22993,Sheldon,Well hey. Now she’s angry too. This thing works like gangbusters.
22994,Penny,Try dialing.
22995,Penny,I dumped them they’re a bunch of wussies.
22996,Penny,Yeah yeah and beauty’s on the inside size doesn’t matter how much she spend?
22997,Leonard,Tell me whether or not to go through with the date.
22998,Sheldon,Yes.
22999,Leonard,Oh no.
23000,Sheldon,I’m sorry who is Mike Drop?
23001,Raj,I don’t want you to pretend to be me. You can be like my uh online wingman. Like if we met her at a bar and you talked me up.
23002,Leonard,Excuse me this is my apartment and she’s my roommate’s sister.
23003,Sheldon,Too bad. It seems like a good way to drink a milk shake without getting brain freeze.
23004,Leonard,You know there’s a foundational idea in string theory that the whole universe may be a hologram.
23005,Raj,So I guess I won’t be seeing you guys for a while.
23006,Howard,Do you want my help or not?
23007,Raj,I’m not sure. Some sort of beta-blocker attached to a molecule extracted from the urine of cows.
23008,Leonard,You’re the one who told Amy in the first place.
23009,Raj,Well if you like dry factual statements interspersed with painful moments of silence it was bananas.
23010,Sheldon,Why are we saying give it to you like that?
23012,Penny,You know it’s no big deal. I can put up with anything for three days.
23013,Leonard,I know I know look you have a TV in your room why don’t you just have breakfast in bed?
23014,Sheldon,Can I invite you in for tea?
23015,Leonard,Yeah come on Howard. Hook that worm.
23016,Sheldon,Yeah well of course I am. I was also right about her hair. It did everything but quack.
23017,Howard,Maybe we’re too smart. So smart it’s offputting.
23018,Howard,How bad is it?
23019,Raj,Okay I don’t have it all worked out yet but I was thinking something like um Oh Indy oh Indy the skies are so windy. Is that a flying man with a killer bod? Wait that’s no man it’s a Norse god.
23020,Penny,I thought you were going to talk to Sheldon.
23021,Leonard,I push my shoulder against the secret door to see if it gives way.
23022,Raj,Well I earned it dude I ate all my broccoli.
23024,Sheldon,Of course I’m doing laundry. Saturday night is laundry night and I’m in a laundry room so I believe your inference is justified.
23025,Penny,Okay well thank you for that but I got you and Leonard a few silly neighbour gifts so I’ll just put them under my tree.
23026,Sheldon,It’s dirty laundry. You’re up.
23027,Penny,Amy get out.
23028,Penny,It’s my boss. They moved my field ride up to Monday.
23029,Leonard,Thanks Mother. I feel much better.
23030,Leonard,You know what the saddest part was?
23031,Leonard,No.
23032,Raj,Oh come on we just need to be more creative. What if you didn’t step on the floor at all? Like what if you swung on a rope from the ceiling?
23033,Sheldon,Do you have a stomach ache too?
23034,Sheldon,Forgive me but I think you’ll find my story is more interesting.
23035,Penny,Yeah I know it’s just this wasn’t the plan it wasn’t supposed to go this way.
23036,Penny,You know if you had a party now you have plenty of friends that would love to come.
23037,Leonard,Oh all right.
23038,Leonard,Look at that. To my friend Leonard from Stan Lee Excelsior!
23039,Sheldon,Can you stop breathing so loud? I can hear your nose whistling.
23040,Leonard,No.
23041,Penny,Oh my God we’re gonna kill them.
23042,Leonard,No.
23043,Penny,I can’t believe you let him kick me out of the car.
23044,Sheldon,There are a number of acceptable answers for example C near earth transport but certainly not B avocado rancher. And your essay suggesting that I’d have better luck making friends if I wait ’til the Cylons take over? Please.
23045,Penny,Thanks for the shoes.
23046,Sheldon,Um well I was worried that you might be missing Leonard. And that might be causing you to have bad dreams like the kind you’d get if you watched Clash of the Titans right before you went to bed.
23047,Sheldon,That’s ridiculous. I am one of the great minds of our generation. I work on a level so rarified you couldn’t even imagine it. I said stop looking at my cool train!
23048,Sheldon, Bernadette.
23049,Raj,Um Expedition 31 will launch this spring to the International Space Station. Crew members will include Commander Tom ‘Tombo’ Johnson astronaut Mike ‘Supernova’ Novacelik and Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz.
23050,Penny,I’m assuming these are some kind of horns they bought at Comic-Con?
23051,Sheldon,Fun and information are two sides to this video podcast not unlike the only two-sided state flag Oregon. Oh look. Hello Mr. Beaver. In future episodes we’ll answer some burning questions. What’s the only non-rectangular flag? What animal appears most often on flags? What animal appears second most often on flags? And more.
23052,Sheldon,No. I mean I have no idea what you smell.
23053,Penny,What?
23054,Sheldon,Is it my fault that when the reporter cited me as the lead scientist I didn’t correct him?
23055,Sheldon,Hah!Penny? Next.
23056,Penny,What?
23057,Leonard,I can’t believe you’ve never seen Raiders of the Lost Ark.
23058,Raj,How did you get here?
23059,Leonard,That is ridiculous.
23060,Raj,Really? I can come? Thanks.
23061,Leonard,It was a spur of the moment thing I figured it would go for thousands and I just wanted to be a part of it.
23062,Howard,I like your bangs.
23063,Sheldon,Did Leonard know about this? Leonard’s my best friend in the world. Surely Leonard didn’t know.
23064,Penny,Um does Pottery Barn Spring count?
23065,Sheldon,Yes but now that I’ve seen what the gift of me with flowers and pie looks like there’s no going back. Boy I can’t wait to see the look on her face. We’re leaving right now.
23066,Sheldon,Hello.
23067,Raj,Yeah right. Wait is it rose gold? Actually don’t tell me I want to be surprised.
23068,Leonard,Excuse me?
23069,Leonard,Okay. Mouth over beak and light chest compressions.
23070,Sheldon,Gentlemen. You may remember Dr. Nowitzki She’s back at Caltech for her postdoc.
23071,Penny,Go! Wow.
23072,Sheldon,Yeah I do. . As is the tradition I have prepared a series of disrespectful jokes which generate humour at Howard’s expense. Prepare to have your ribs tickled. Howard I always thought you’d be the last one of us to ever get married because you are so short and unappealing. Am I right? Let’s see here. Oh seriously though Howard you’re actually one of the most intelligent people I know. And that’s a zinger because you’re not. I’ve always thought that you’d make someone a fine husband someday. Assuming you’d be able to get the parts and develop the engineering skills to assemble them which I don’t see as likely. Hacha! Okay let me see here. Okay kidding aside Howard you are a good friend. And I wish you nothing but happiness. Bazinga I don’t!
23073,Leonard,What’s going on?
23074,Leonard,I can’t tell you that either.
23075,Raj,Okay uh I’d pick swan because uh the resulting hybrid would have the advanced industrial civilization of a human and the long graceful neck I’ve always dreamed of having.
23076,Sheldon,What matters is the greatest scientific achievement of my life is based on a blunder. I’m not a genius I’m a fraud.
23077,Raj,What difference does it make? Fat is fat.
23078,Sheldon,Yes. I thought I can’t decide if I should watch The Flash TV show. I know I’ll ask Amy. Anyway.
23079,Sheldon,Exactly. See how well we work together?
23080,Leonard,I’m at work Sheldon. 
23081,Sheldon,This act of aggression must be met with swift and cruel ferocity. It is time to cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war.
23082,Sheldon,Thank you Bert. You’re a good man. That woman who stood you up and humiliated you last night really missed out.
23083,Sheldon,Do you know I’m such a good mood I’m actually finding your tenuous grasp of the English language folksy and charming today.
23085,Penny,Well kind of takes the romance out of relationships.
23086,Sheldon,I just want you both to know when I publish my findings I won’t forget your contributions.
23087,Leonard,I’m good.
23088,Sheldon,What a beautiful job Stephanie did. I might have gone with a mattress suture instead of a blanket stitch but you can’t argue with her results. It’s a shame it won’t scar the war wound is a time-honoured badge of masculinity.
23089,Leonard,I thought we were letting it go.
23090,Howard,Judge’s ruling?
23091,Leonard,What are you doing here? I thought you were out with Sheldon and Amy.
23093,Raj,Hey Sheldon I’m sorry.
23094,Leonard,Yeah it is.
23095,Sheldon,Keep it up. I got nowhere else to be.
23096,Howard,I… I don’t believe it this is a terrible betrayal of my trust.
23097,Howard,Thank you but how do I know you’re not saying that just to be nice?
23098,Leonard,Khoo-vakh! She took my Where’s Waldo.
23099,Howard,You know if I had a week off I’d go back to the Two Bunch Palms Resort and Spa in the desert. I tell you an hour on the massage table with Trevor and you’ll feel like you were born without bones.
23100,Sheldon,I should think so.
23101,Leonard,Sheldon are you sure you want to be bringing Raj on your date night with Amy?
23102,Leonard,So are you really not gonna do this movie?
23103,Leonard,Glowing letters appear on the chest that read If squashed to death you wish not to be sing of Svaty Vaclav and his victory.
23104,Penny,There you go. You’re all done.
23105,Penny,Oh it was okay I guess wasn’t a big turn out but they both really seemed to like it.
23106,Raj,Well then double it because my building’s a lot nicer than this dump.
23107,Leonard,The end.
23108,Penny,What are you talking about.
23109,Penny,Really?
23110,Howard,Hang on hang on. There’s a 7-Eleven here. We smuggle Slurpies which are essentially Icees in under our coats after having a pleasant meal either here here or here.
23111,Leonard,When we watch Frosty the Snowman he roots for the sun.
23112,Penny,He doesn’t need to know what we were doing Leonard.
23113,Penny,Zod?
23114,Penny,Hey pal you want to live here or not?
23115,Sheldon,You’re okay if you run into crocodiles just kick them with your boots.
23116,Howard,I don’t know. Maybe ’cause dark doesn’t show the stains?
23117,Leonard,Oh right yeah um so Stephanie here’s the thing. I really like you.
23118,Leonard,Who’s there?
23119,Raj,Still my first choice for an ankle tattoo. Or a dolphin I go back and forth.
23120,Howard,What?
23121,Leonard,I’m sorry if this stuff is gonna make the ceremony awkward.
23122,Raj,But it says eight a.m.
23124,Leonard,Uh if you don’t mind Mrs. Cooper there’s a 305 nonstop back to Los Angeles and you have no idea how much I want to be on it.
23125,Leonard,No it was called for.
23126,Howard,I’m not going to punch you.
23127,Sheldon,Where’s Howard?
23128,Sheldon,Would you pass the mustard?
23129,Leonard,No you listen. You’re my woman and I’m gonna make you feel things you have never felt before.
23130,Sheldon,Leonard isn’t the kind of guy anyone usually goes out with. Would you be open to rotating the couch clockwise thirty degrees?
23131,Leonard,No. But Jessica Alba did rub my furry belly.
23132,Sheldon,All right. Then is it fair to say that you’re experiencing some sort of emotional turmoil over the events involving Penny earlier this evening?
23133,Leonard,Good day?
23134,Howard,Uh yeah I mean her serve was pretty good.
23135,Sheldon,Look it was actually designed for my vintage Mr Spock action figure.
23136,Sheldon,Oh golly however did he humiliate you?
23137,Penny,Okay it’s not me right? This script is terrible.
23138,Sheldon,No I need a new woman in my life to ignore so I can hyper-focus on my work again.
23139,Sheldon,Don’t worry. Wonder Woman was an Amazon. And Amazons tend to be very beefy gals.
23140,Leonard,Yeah. It can get chilly but Raj figured out that if you pee in a bottle and put it in your sleeping bag it helps keep you warm. Here’s the hotel room we all share.
23141,Raj,Yes Emily. Whatever. Where’s Sheldon?
23142,Leonard,Seriously Barry stop.
23143,Sheldon,Make it so.
23144,Raj,So uh what are you guys talking about?
23145,Sheldon,I don’t mean to be rude or discourteous but before we begin I’d just like to say there is absolutely no scientific evidence to support clairvoyance of any kind. Which means and again no insult intended that you’re a fraud your profession is a swindle and uh your livelihood is dependent on the gullibility of stupid people. Again no offence.
23146,Raj,You could try saying that without smiling.
23147,Howard,He almost made it to the top this time.
23148,Sheldon,Here. Now are we friends? Colleagues? Lovers? Are you my grandmother?
23149,Howard,Let me finish.
23150,Sheldon,Oh that’s easy enough. We’d need a large tank of water a hoop to jump through and a bucket of whatever bite-sized treats you find tasty.
23152,Sheldon,Really? I didn’t see you draw one from your quiver.
23153,Howard,No Sheldon’s right. Emily did say I always talk about my feelings too much.
23154,Sheldon,No you!
23156,Sheldon,Oh no let’s assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second. Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Miss Lane who is now travelling at approximately 120 miles per hour hits them and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces.
23157,Sheldon,Perhaps. But my mom made me spaghetti with chopped-up hot dogs whenever I wanted so who cares?
23158,Penny,No. No you don’t you really don’t. I actually can’t say don’t enough.
23159,Sheldon,You seemed confused.
23160,Leonard,I hope she wasn’t anything like my flatmate from Texas.
23161,Leonard,Can’t believe I’m spending my wedding night with you.
23162,Raj,Oh. You know what? I’m gonna let them know that I’m here with you and that they’re busted.
23163,Leonard,That was pretty droll. With a hint of ammonia.
23164,Leonard,I don’t know if I’m comfortable with that.
23165,Penny,I’m sorry I yelled at you. It’s not your fault.
23166,Raj,I wouldn’t say she’s beautiful.
23167,Penny,Yeah that was the point of the story.
23168,Penny,What?
23169,Sheldon,My aunt Marion gave them to me for my 12th birthday. She thought if I failed at theoretical physics that I should have a trade to fall back on. And by the way the blood pressure cuff is called a sphygmomanometer.
23170,Penny,Anyway I’m really sorry I made fun of your stutter in high school.
23171,Penny,You do realize I stand on the other side of the door waiting for you to finish knocking three times.
23172,Raj,Did he respond yet?
23173,Leonard,I’d like to reinstate the you-not-talking rule.
23174,Raj,Hey.
23175,Leonard,Oh hey.
23176,Howard,It’s uh been a long time since I’ve seen a girl’s really not her shoulder.
23177,Penny,Hey.
23179,Leonard,Probably.
23180,Penny,I don’t know maybe it’s the local cuisine. Okay well it’s nice to meet you just gonna set you on down over here and I’m going to leave so Namaste.  And FYI you’d be lucky to have me as a daughter-in-law.
23181,Howard,What’s that?
23182,Penny,You poor thing.
23183,Leonard,You’re cool with you and me just being friends right?
23184,Penny,Okay I have not tried to change Leonard. That’s just what happens in relationships. Look how much Amy’s changed you.
23185,Leonard,Yeah I wish.
23186,Penny,Okay. You know what? I see where this is going. I’m not one of you guys. I’m not a scientist. So just…
23188,Sheldon,No. You’re my friend and I’m sorry.
23190,Leonard,Thanks Dad.
23191,Sheldon,Yes actually it would but let’s see how the lid goes. I’m not strong enough Leonard you’ll have to do it.
23192,Leonard,What?
23193,Raj,For which she awarded him the nickname “speed of light Leonard.”
23194,Penny,Something happen at the meeting?
23195,Sheldon,Of course. Now get it yourself you traitor.
23196,Sheldon,Hello Howard. I’ve realized that you scaring me was all in jest. Allow me to say job well done.  Perfect.
23197,Penny,You’re welcome.
23198,Penny,There nice and comfy cosy. Zero zero zero.
23199,Howard,Here you go.
23200,Penny,Okay if it’s sometimes Howie wears yours Leonard already told us.
23201,Penny,Dave is not smarter than you. He’s an idiot.
23202,Leonard,For an hour and a half?
23203,Howard,Like what?
23204,Sheldon,Oh I never identified with the rebel alliance. Despite their tendency to build Death Stars I’ve always been more of an empire man.
23205,Penny,Look I’m not happy this happened but I think I can get past it. I mean we weren’t engaged at the time and it was just kissing.
23206,Sheldon,Correct.
23207,Howard,You don’t like Mouse Boy? How about uh uh Kid Vermin?
23208,Howard,It’s true but on the other hand you are wearing a bird sweater.
23209,Leonard,All right well anyway Darwin observed that when two groups of finches competed over the same food source eventually one of them would evolve a different beak shape so they could feed on something else.
23210,Leonard,Really? I wouldn’t know what that’s like.
23211,Raj,You can’t ignore it. It’s not that postcard that says it’s time to go back to the dentist.
23212,Raj,Oh good. Namaste Grandpa.
23213,Leonard,What’s that?
23215,Penny,Yes.
23216,Sheldon,I’m not sure. It doesn’t feel right.
23217,Leonard,Penny laid into me too. Apparently I’m overly fixated on premium Swiss chocolate bars.
23218,Penny,God he’s an ass when he drinks.
23219,Raj,Thank you.
23220,Penny,What does it matter? The point is I’m choosing you.
23221,Sheldon,Really? Despite the sign that says “Do not leave laundry unattended”?
23222,Leonard,Yes he’s new at the zoo.
23223,Sheldon,The entrance to the dungeon is a moss covered door. You manage to open it only to find yourself face-to-face with a hideous foul-smelling moss-covered ogre. What do you do?
23224,Sheldon,It’s an outrage.
23225,Sheldon,Yeah well then do it.
23226,Penny,Because I beat you.
23227,Howard,Can we please talk about something other than my depressing love life?
23228,Raj,Of course I do.
23229,Penny,Yeah sorry about that.
23230,Raj,Did you pinky swear?
23231,Leonard,No. Sheldon doesn’t like reclaimed wood.
23232,Leonard,It’s amazing.
23233,Sheldon,It’s the kind of thing you ought to know now that we have one.
23234,Leonard,Oh. When I encountered alien life I discovered that the key thing was not to sit in its spot.
23235,Sheldon,Uh huh. So it’s a shelf?
23236,Sheldon,Sold.
23237,Sheldon,Oh good. Hah-hah!
23238,Raj,Sounds about right.
23239,Sheldon,Oh dear God!
23240,Sheldon,You may want to sit down.
23241,Raj,The lonely guy and the two happy couples? I’d rather get a prostate exam from a leper who walks away with nine fingers.
23242,Leonard,Oh the ancient Romans put spiced toast in their punch bowls.
23243,Leonard,Ah terrific. We’re getting the electron accelerator set up. We should be ready to go day after tomorrow.
23244,Penny,I know one way to find out. Sniff this.
23245,Sheldon,Do you like trains?
23246,Sheldon,Not this time. Then they wouldn’t be special. Thanks Penny.
23247,Sheldon,Really?
23248,Raj,Actually I was thinking Leonard.
23249,Howard,No you see I’m doing this so I can stop being spoiled and you know grow as a person.
23250,Sheldon,Well I mean it. I’m really happy for you. And that’s how you get a toothpaste commercial. Cheers.
23251,Penny,Well thank you. I’ll see you tomorrow.
23252,Raj,Maybe you don’t want someone exactly like you. You know what they say opposites attract.
23253,Sheldon,What I’m saying is that we took quite an unnecessary detour from what I now understand to be your thesis.
23254,Howard,Mrs Bell was deaf she’s not even going to hear you knock.
23255,Howard,What the heck is this?
23256,Penny,Okay great. Oh wait. Uh it’s sold out.
23257,Howard,You don’t have to you should want to.
23259,Penny,No.
23260,Leonard,They’re running a little behind. Should be pretty soon.
23261,Howard,Well are you talking about when he thought he was real?
23262,Penny,Well you know that was a long time ago. You’re a different woman now. You’re smart you’ve got great friends you’ve got a boyfriend you’re pretty you have zero fashion sense but anyway tonight we’re gonna do whatever you want.
23263,Raj,Does he sound like a criminal?
23264,Howard,He’ll have a Shirley Temple.
23265,Sheldon,No I am not saying that because I kept saying that this morning and Leonard said stop saying that.
23266,Penny,If it’s because you lost a stick I know where it went.
23267,Leonard,Sure. Oh god you smell so good. Of course that could just be my other senses getting stronger. Hypothetically if I had access To a Lieutenant Uhura uniform would you wear it?
23268,Sheldon,Miners often sang mining songs to keep their spirits up.
23269,Raj,Well I mean yeah it freaked me out a little but that’s my issue not yours.
23270,Howard,As soon as I have the place set up I’m gonna have you guys over.
23271,Sheldon,Yes. But she knows how important Star Wars is to me.
23272,Leonard,Yeah. The doctor didn’t want me to rub my eye during the night. It was either this or one of those giant neck cones.
23274,Leonard,Well great.
23275,Penny,Priya told you. What a little gossip. You know not an attractive quality in a woman Leonard. Not judging just my opinion.
23276,Leonard,How about it Sheldon?
23277,Sheldon,Really?
23278,Howard,Hey.
23279,Sheldon,Oh. Yeah well I was waylaid by Penny Bernadette and Amy. They made me reveal confidential information about Howard’s father.
23280,Sheldon,While others mourned Lucky I realised his untimely demise provided me with the opportunity to replace him with something more suited to my pet needs. A faithful companion that I could snuggle with at night and yet would be capable of killing upon telepathic command.
23281,Sheldon,My sympathies. I am no stranger to the crimson scourge that is dermatitis. Can I interest you in a topical steroid from my lotion and unguent collection?
23282,Leonard,SNIPE!
23283,Sheldon,Perhaps. But they might ask me something else.
23284,Sheldon,You’re welcome. And if he has twins we can do all kinds of neat experiments on them.
23285,Sheldon,I’m uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny.
23286,Raj,Well we all knew this day was coming.
23287,Raj,Maybe your nickname should be Brown Dynamite.
23288,Penny,All right you know what I will tell you why it’s wrong…
23289,Sheldon,Well whatever it is it’s troubling me. And I can’t eat I can’t sleep. And don’t even ask about the consistency of my bowel movements.
23290,Penny,Well here we are.
23291,Sheldon,Oh true. But all the clenching in the world will not keep testicles in your abdomen.
23292,Penny,What are you doing?
23293,Penny,Oh. So the heart you got from the wizard giving you trouble?
23294,Leonard,It’s probably USC or UCLA.
23295,Penny,So we’re good?
23296,Sheldon,What’s going on is we’re about to go to a prom. And there’s a great deal of pressure on young couples like us to engage in what Mr. Bob Eubanks called making whoopee.
23297,Leonard,Hey.
23298,Sheldon,Yes. If you use my toothbrush I’ll jump out that window. Please don’t come to my funeral. Have a good night.
23299,Leonard,Excellent.
23300,Sheldon,No I haven’t. It’s all good.
23301,Leonard,I don’t know what that is but if it means I can go home and sleep then yes.
23302,Sheldon,Oh God oh God oh God! It’s all right. They didn’t take my comic books.
23303,Howard,Not me. Ever since you admitted we had a vibe I’ve been planning our wedding.
23304,Sheldon,Because I am without friends. Like the proverbial cheese I stand alone. Even while seated.
23305,Leonard,Thank you.
23306,Sheldon,Leonard what if you have an allergic reaction to the surgeon’s latex gloves?
23307,Raj,Uh you were in the building you were at the university then you were somewhere on Colorado Boulevard.
23308,Leonard,My point is Priya’s gone. And it would be much better if no-one else found out about this.
23309,Sheldon,She’s in my spot. Don’t look at me like that everybody knows that my spot.
23310,Raj,Damn it.
23311,Leonard,No. You’re on vacation.
23312,Sheldon,You’re in luck this is an easy one. In a world where mankind is ruled by a giant intelligent beaver what food is no longer consumed?
23313,Leonard,I’m sorry Dr. Jeffries I’m just excited. This nano vacuum tube idea of yours is it’s really interesting.
23314,Sheldon,Statistically red cars are stopped by police far more often than any other colour. I don’t want any hassles with the fuzz.
23315,Leonard,Yeah so I’m out.
23316,Leonard,Raj you’re up.
23317,Leonard,She’s not coming back.
23318,Raj,For God’s sake just drive in the knife why don’t you.
23319,Leonard,Well I wrote some of it down.
23320,Sheldon,Wonderful. Meaningless pleasantries accomplished. Elizabeth Leonard’s bathroom time is coming up and believe me you do not want to follow him.
23321,Penny,Ugh I cannot believe Christie let Howard into my apartment.    
23322,Raj,You enjoy giving people grades.
23323,Penny,Three gr… Oh my God! Look look Amy all you need to know is you are my friend and I don’t want to lose you out of my life.
23324,Raj,You’re lucky. With me it’s usually the other way around.
23325,Leonard,I know what you’re doing. You don’t want me going on this research trip because you’re afraid to be alone.
23326,Penny,We just broke up.
23327,Sheldon,You know what? I used to be a fan of evolution but I’ve since evolved and now I think it’s dumb.
23328,Sheldon,Guess I’m not the only one who watches ’70s television crime dramas.
23329,Penny,Is that true?
23330,Leonard,Well it sounds wonderful.
23331,Penny,So do you think that if Leonard and I keep dating he’ll eventually get bored with me.
23332,Sheldon,Interesting. Sex works even better than chocolate to modify behaviour. I wonder if anyone else has stumbled on to that.
23333,Sheldon,You were right. This was a very productive evening. I saw a whole new side of Amy Farrah Fowler tonight.
23334,Penny,No. I just run till I’m hungry then I stop for a bear claw.
23335,Sheldon,All you did was offer maternal care and affection and all you received in return was rude and insensitive behavior.
23336,Penny,Well yeah but…
23337,Sheldon,Your relationship with Leonard?
23338,Leonard,Well it’s not difficult you just listen to what she says and then you say something appropriate in response.
23339,Penny,Yeah just tuck that part in your pants;  you’ll be fine.
23341,Leonard,Oh no that’s terrible. Ooh the line’s moving. Got to go. Bye.
23342,Sheldon,Oh no he’s not uncomfortable at all. No he’s loving it. Yeah he’s strutting around like he’s five-foot-six.
23343,Raj,Padma Kapur Neha Chowdury.
23344,Sheldon,I’m not going to bother him I’m going to talk to him.
23345,Sheldon,All right.
23346,Leonard,Oh look at that. The Oklahoma coach has thrown down a red flag indicating he’s challenging the ruling on the field. I hope he’s right ’cause if he’s not it’ll cost him one of his three time-Outs.
23347,Sheldon,He should share our love of technology.
23348,Sheldon,Good for you.
23349,Howard,Okay so I’m on a Comic-Con message board and there’s a post from a guy where he says he got caught using someone else’s badge and Sheldon was right he did get charged with petty theft. Guys if I go to jail dressed as the Human Torch that might send the wrong message.
23350,Howard,We only had four servants. And two of them were children.
23351,Penny,Okay I guess we’re improvising now.
23352,Leonard,Okay uh how do I put this? Um are you familiar with Darwin’s observation of the finches in the Galapagos Islands?
23353,Sheldon,Excellent question. Do you remember what happened to the alien played by talented character actor Frank Gorshin in the Star Trek episode Let That Be Your Last Battlefield?
23354,Penny,Um hey hey can I talk to you about that for a second?
23355,Raj,Oh right uh girlfriend. Okay.
23357,Sheldon,Onion rings?
23358,Penny,Really? We’re going to do an experiment?
23359,Howard,No I’m actually dating two women. Later.
23360,Sheldon,Thank you for the clarification.
23361,Howard,Well to be honest we only went on four dates hugged twice kissed once and there was a handshake loaded with sexual innuendo.
23362,Penny,I don’t know what to tell you Sheldon.
23364,Sheldon,Bazinga! None of you ever see my practical jokes coming do you?
23365,Penny,Me too.
23366,Howard,I didn’t come to help I came to mock.
23367,Penny,Like this. I am so happy for you.
23368,Howard,Really?
23369,Sheldon,Well if I didn’t think you could handle it I wouldn’t be asking.
23370,Sheldon,My original point.
23371,Leonard,Every hotel is booked. But yeah see this space here between Sheldon’s feet and my head? That’s where you go.
23372,Leonard,The old Unabomber approach. Kudos.
23373,Sheldon,Yeah but that’s shooting fish in a barrel. You’re kind of a sad sack. I’m sorry I shouldn’t have said that. I’m just upset.
23374,Howard,I’m sorry. We can’t all eat whatever we want and still stay thin. Wait in the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy isn’t forty-three the answer to the question of life the universeand everything?
23375,Sheldon,Well that’s a fine how-do-you-do. Don’t just stand there. Take your breasts out.
23376,Howard,Okay we’ll call that plan B.
23377,Sheldon,Neither do I. But we can find out together.
23378,Howard,Lava serpent.
23379,Raj,Why don’t you ask her to come up?
23380,Leonard,If I take a Lactaid a half-hour before and some Pepto right after.
23381,Penny,Hmm. Damn. All right. Thank you.
23382,Howard,Knock yourself out.
23383,Sheldon,I finally have the time to test my hypothesis about the separation of the water molecules from the egg proteins and its impact vis-a-vis taste.
23384,Leonard,Hey hey. Listen I I have a little confession to make.
23385,Leonard,Yes but we all agreed that the third Thursday of every month would be Anything Can Happen Thursday.
23386,Howard,Why don’t I just tell you what I heard today.
23387,Sheldon,Has to be? Has to be? I hope you’re being deliberately provocative.
23388,Penny,Add a belt and I’ll take you some place nice.
23389,Raj,No I was in India it was humid and smelled funny.
23390,Sheldon,Then buckle up you’re in for a cranky night.
23391,Penny,Raj you’re a great guy you’re in a bar full of single women let us help you.
23392,Raj,So I read a study that says a man with a dog is three times more likely to get a woman’s phone number.
23393,Penny,Oh I’m sure he’s fine.
23394,Sheldon,Hold on Doctor. Leonard where are your social skills? This man is clearly upset. We should invite him in for a hot beverage.
23395,Leonard,Hey you want to talk about not getting love from a parent. You know what I used to do when I was little to have some sensation of human contact?
23396,Sheldon,We built a fort.
23397,Raj,No no not like Haroun and Tanweer.
23398,Leonard,You’re right. I’m fine. I’m wearing this.
23399,Sheldon,Bruce Wayne doesn’t wear a clip-on.
23400,Penny,Why were you keeping this a secret?
23401,Sheldon,I want you to crawl back to him and apologize.
23402,Leonard,Is the Wi-Fi working for you?
23403,Howard,Congratulations.
23404,Sheldon,I am in every way.
23405,Sheldon,What can I say? I put the fun in funeral.
23406,Leonard,Um why would I mean Alex?
23407,Leonard,Well we’re not in India.
23408,Leonard,Well yes but things have changed you know you’re older I’m older. Look no more superhero bedsheets.
23409,Leonard,Oh that’s excellent. It’s a weird figure of speech isn’t it we won when you weren’t
23410,Leonard,What?
23411,Sheldon,That’s what makes their friendship unlikely
23412,Leonard,Where is he?
23413,Penny,Here you go boys. I’ll pick it up when you’re ready.
23414,Sheldon,Yes. I don’t need an emotion machine. I am one.
23415,Leonard,I’ll be right back.
23416,Raj,That’s ’cause we’re the good guys.
23417,Raj,Oh you’re where that bill goes.
23418,Sheldon,I’ve never applied for a patent before. I wanted to make a good impression.
23419,Sheldon,I like the hamburgers where we usually have hamburgers you can’t make the assumption that I’ll like the hamburgers here.
23420,Howard,First day of cricket camp. They drew it so the testicles were my eyes.
23421,Howard,I got you a talking Thomas the Tank Engine for Thanksgiving.
23422,Leonard,You can’t just replace someone you care about with some other random person.
23423,Leonard,Yeah. He’s ganged up.
23424,Sheldon,Well powder me in sugar and call me a doughnut if it isn’t Leonard Hofstadter.
23425,Sheldon,I don’t know why you’re so surprised. If there’s one thing I know about after living with you for so many years it’s how to compromise.
23426,Raj,That’s very good. Jolly amusing but if you don’t mind I’ll hold off until sunset on titan.
23427,Sheldon,Excuse me. I’ve been drafting contracts since kindergarten. Didn’t need a lawyer to get me out of finger painting. Don’t need one now.
23428,Sheldon,Want me to show my work?
23429,Penny,All right. See you later.
23430,Leonard,Yeah I guess I did.
23431,Sheldon,You managed the situation?
23432,Leonard,If only we had one.
23433,Raj,Remember that little planetary object I spotted beyond the Kuiper belt?
23435,Leonard,Hey!
23436,Sheldon,Well that’s the thing about factoids they’re interesting.
23437,Raj,With pleasure.
23438,Penny,Hey.
23439,Raj,Hmm. Interesting. Did they take a walk down Liars’ Lane?
23440,Howard,How about “Die toaster die”?
23441,Sheldon,Well then it’s settled.
23442,Sheldon,The Pharmacology Department controls that and they’re all hopped up on experimental steroids.
23443,Raj,Yeah he’s a ginormous knob.
23444,Sheldon,You’re out too by the way.
23445,Raj,Well I don’t mind. Oh you want go to the mall and look at baby stuff?
23446,Raj,I’m so not talking to you. I’m talking to him.
23448,Penny,Agreed.
23449,Leonard,What’s going on? What do you want?
23450,Penny,But I could get her.
23451,Sheldon,I ready my quarter-staff.
23452,Sheldon,Leonard doesn’t have time to chat he has to get the mail.
23453,Sheldon,You’re the milk thief! Leonard said I was crazy but I knew that carton felt lighter.
23454,Howard,Do you ever do anything for anyone else?
23455,Howard,I can’t believe Penny’s gonna get to go and I’m not.
23456,Sheldon,Dear Lord! Have you been drinking it?
23457,Leonard,Sheldon I’m not going to learn Morse code at three o’clock in the morning!
23458,Leonard,We didn’t even get to go through it all. There could be anything in here.
23459,Howard,Like how women often forget the pain of childbirth.
23460,Sheldon,Well truth be told as a child I did dream of going to space. Those astronauts were my heroes. And when you got to go it was hard for me.
23461,Penny,Look we got really angry at each other and you just got caught in the middle of it.
23462,Leonard,Oh hey Penny this just arrived we just brought this up just now.
23463,Leonard,Let’s just eat so I can get to bed. With any luck tonight will be the night my sleep apnoea kills me.
23464,Leonard,I did it I did it I’m in the queue.
23465,Howard,I’m not pouting I’m brooding. Which is how sexy men pout.
23466,Leonard,Guys that’s really starting to get old.
23467,Howard,Under the careful supervision of her godfather.
23468,Howard,So anyway after a fantastic lunch I was whisked off to the People magazine photo shoot… have any of you boys ever been to a photo shoot?
23469,Sheldon,You’re in my spot.
23470,Leonard,Well you might have to cook for one more because she invited Zack.
23471,Raj,Why is that great news?
23472,Raj,What you invited your girlfriend? This is supposed to be our weekend.
23473,Sheldon,Ladies please. These four walls once housed an intellectual salon where the mind received nourishment as well as the stomach. But through no one’s fault Penny the quality of dinner conversation in this apartment has declined. And again I’m looking at no one in particular Penny.
23474,Penny,That’s hilarious. No.
23475,Sheldon,Well hello.
23476,Sheldon,You’re right the tiara was too much.
23477,Sheldon,I haven’t. I’ve been meaning to but who has the time?
23478,Penny,When did I have pistachios?
23479,Leonard,No just sit here.
23480,Howard,Brisket party! B-to-the-R-to-the-I-S-K… To-the-E-to-the-T… Ooh…
23481,Leonard,No.
23483,Leonard,Really?
23484,Penny,Listening to my father go on and on about what a great guy you are.
23485,Leonard,No no I think it’ll be great. Maybe next time he gets conjunctivitis at work she can hold his head and try to put the drops in his eyes. Giant baby.
23486,Sheldon,I must say Howard I think a detailed letter to MIT describing your current circumstances might entitle you to a refund on your master’s degree.
23487,Penny,Hey can you hold off redoing the room? My brother’s coming out here in a few weeks.
23488,Leonard,What? That’s great. Guys.
23489,Sheldon,Afterwards Leonard blew his nose and pie came out.
23490,Raj,I don’t know. Have you ever seen a movie with Stuart before?
23491,Penny,Okay it’s just at the restaurant when you said you wanted us to be together again it got very real very fast and I panicked.
23492,Sheldon,You did not break up with Joyce Kim she defected to North Korea.
23493,Penny,Okay.
23494,Howard,I don’t know she didn’t even give me a reason.
23495,Sheldon,Why not?
23496,Leonard,Oh hey Penny do you want to go to the airport with me later to pick up my mother?
23497,Leonard,Okay bye.
23498,Leonard,Look in our defence it was kind of a spur of the moment thing and also we don’t like her.
23499,Leonard,It’s a secure lab in a classified facility only the U.S. government and us.
23500,Howard,Okay.
23501,Penny,Well it was an accident.I am so sorry I lied.
23502,Howard,Can we please get back to the game?
23503,Leonard,Don’t worry Sheldon. We’ll be fine.
23504,Leonard,Sorry.
23505,Sheldon,You’re so kind. You know I don’t know how I ever got by without you.
23506,Raj,What do you say Howard?
23507,Sheldon,So my blade shall not taste blood tonight?
23508,Leonard,Don’t.
23509,Penny,Don’t play dumb with me Ricardo Shilly-Shally!
23510,Howard,But he’s afraid of dogs.
23511,Leonard,Yes.
23512,Sheldon,Hush. If you have questions raise your hand. It’s a warm summer evening circa 600 BC you’ve finished your shopping at the local market or agora and you look up at the night sky. There you notice some of the stars seem to move so you name them planetes or wanderer. Yes Penny?
23513,Raj,Yeah I can relate to being a single parent. I have a dog.
23514,Sheldon,Oh that’s very kind of you. Next time I have a hankering to wash down a D cell battery with a jar of old pickle juice I’ll come a-knocking.
23515,Penny,So what are you guys doing?
23516,Howard,I want to apologize for Amy last night. She was completely out of line. Are you are you not speaking to me or did the screen freeze again?
23517,Leonard,Oh my God what did they get?
23518,Leonard, Thank you.
23519,Leonard,Yeah good for you.
23520,Sheldon,Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
23521,Penny,Shame on you guys. 
23522,Leonard,I know. As far as science goes this is the adventure of a lifetime.
23523,Leonard,Hey Lesley.
23524,Howard,Hey remember The Ark of the Covenant?
23525,Sheldon,Okay sure. I don’t see a problem with that.
23526,Penny,I’m sleeping with your son.
23527,Howard,Hey.
23528,Leonard,All righty then. Guess I’ll just get started.
23529,Sheldon,It’s a Pokémon reference.
23530,Leonard,For some reason we’re planning a future where we both live with Sheldon forever.
23532,Leonard,Aren’t you going to thank Penny for taking you to Disneyland?
23533,Sheldon,I must say Amy pretending to have intercourse with you is giving me a great deal of satisfaction.
23534,Howard,Really? Because I’m dating two women is basically the only cool thing I can say about myself.
23535,Leonard,And the board of directors. Abort! Abort!
23536,Penny,I cannot believe you travelled the entire country and never left the train station.
23537,Penny,No.
23538,Sheldon,I’m not jealous. I’m just very unhappy that good things are happening for him and not happening for me.
23539,Sheldon,Why?
23540,Sheldon,Although Road Trip God does have a certain ring to it.
23541,Howard,Actually.
23542,Leonard,Goodnight Sheldon.
23543,Leonard,Well how about if we don’t think about this as a relationship? It could be more like a new version of software. Penny and Leonard 2.0. We can test it internally shake out the bugs and if we both feel it’s solid then we’ll roll it out to the public.
23544,Leonard,Hey.
23545,Penny,What happened?
23546,Sheldon,You’re a good man.
23547,Howard,Fine just try not to look too alive.
23548,Penny,Yep okay.
23549,Sheldon,Well I’m sorry too. And if you want to live with Penny then I think you should.
23550,Sheldon,Hey hey. She’s mine take a cold shower grandpa.
23551,Sheldon,What happened to the rest of your group?
23552,Leonard,Oh hold on Howard. There’s lots of better times.
23553,Sheldon,I thought your father was a gynaecologist. I’m sorry. 
23554,Leonard,I mean I’m glad they’re getting along but it’s starting to make me uncomfortable.
23555,Sheldon,Just roll the clip.  So tell us in your own words about that magical moment when Fun with Flags was born.
23556,Leonard,See you.
23557,Leonard,Wuh I I broke up with Joyce Kim.
23558,Leonard,Uh that’s a great question Zack.
23559,Penny,No there was supposed to be a big scene with me and Mark Harmon but it’s gone.
23560,Leonard,Did I miss anything? Did they kick Giselle off?
23561,Penny,Just do it!  Get inside and shut the door.
23562,Howard,At least Leonard Howard and I would have always been friends.
23563,Sheldon,Oh no we’ll still be playing it tonight this game can easily take eight hours.
23564,Penny,Come on Sheldon we’ll watch Game of Thrones over here.
23565,Penny,Uh a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush?
23566,Sheldon,And you did it so casually no rapid breathing no increase in perspiration.
23567,Penny,I really don’t want to talk about it.
23568,Sheldon,Oh excuse me that is my mother you’re talking about however accurately.
23569,Sheldon,Now remember Newton realized that Aristotle was wrong and force was not necessary to maintain motion. So let’s plug in our 9.8 meters per second squared as A and we get force Earth gravity equals mass times 9.8 meters per second per second. So we can see that MA equals MG and what do we know from this?
23570,Sheldon,Good night Leonard.
23571,Raj,Hold on I don’t think she was impressed.
23572,Sheldon,Why would I join you?
23573,Sheldon,Yeah the name always confused me anyway Soup Plantation. You can’t grow soup.
23574,Sheldon,Four keys! Who does he think he is a warden?
23575,Leonard,What are you doing?
23576,Leonard,You’ll never guess what just happened.
23577,Sheldon,Well I guess it was too good to be true.
23578,Penny,How?
23579,Howard,Howard listen to me. You’re a great husband. Yes your listening skills could use some work. But it’s amazing how far you’ve come given that you’re an only child raised by an over-protective mom.
23580,Leonard,I don’t know what you’re talking about. Oh that. Penny did that.
23581,Leonard,Or you know we could get take-out and watch the Blu-ray extended version of The Hobbit movie with commentary track. On account of how sad I am about my mom.
23582,Sheldon,Yes. Whew I feel ten pounds lighter.
23583,Howard,What?
23584,Leonard,What? Yeah.
23585,Howard,Wow that’s amazing.
23586,Sheldon,What if I play the Star Trek theme on my nose?
23587,Leonard,That was fun. Thank you.
23588,Howard,And Gertie can’t stop crying.
23589,Sheldon,I’ve found an emulator online that lets you play classic text based computer games from the 1980s.
23590,Penny,I I’m not sure. Maybe a few days. Unless he gets the job then who knows?
23591,Howard,Oh what did I do?
23592,Howard,Mm I’m thinking about adopting some quirky affectation like a pipe or a monocle or a handlebar moustache.
23593,Sheldon,I told you not to get the surgery.
23594,Howard,Boy when you met Bernadette the field of robotics really took a hit.
23595,Leonard,The math is all there. It’s not real.
23597,Sheldon,It’s illegal to spay a human being.
23598,Raj,Miss.
23599,Howard,So what’s gonna happen next? Are you and Bernadette going to break up?
23600,Leonard,Yeah maybe it’s good you got us talking about this stuff.
23601,Sheldon,One moment.  I’m hell-bent on catching a cyber criminal not the common cold.
23602,Sheldon,Oh that was never happening.
23603,Penny,Okay you know what? You are unbelievable. You buy all these superhero T-shirts but when it’s time for you to step up and do the right thing you just hide in the laundry room.
23604,Raj,Well now it’s biguous. What are you gonna do about it?
23605,Sheldon,Oh no he’s drinking it.
23606,Sheldon,Well I’m not giving it away. 
23607,Penny,Oh my God yes.
23608,Howard,Annie Ogly.
23609,Penny,Yeah it’s true. Amy told me.
23611,Penny,Terrific. Are we there yet?
23613,Sheldon,Yeah? We have to be somewhere.
23614,Sheldon,Oh that is so… so…
23615,Penny,Uh you know when I was in high school there was this girl who was talking about me behind my back so me and all my friends we cornered her in the bathroom and forgave her.
23616,Penny,No.
23617,Raj,Okay where should I put them?
23618,Sheldon,All right I see what’s going on. This is the opening salvo in what will be an escalating series of juvenile tit-for-tat exchanges. Well titted.
23619,Penny,Oh.
23620,Leonard,What?
23621,Sheldon,You’re kidding right? It’s a bust of Sir Isaac Newton.
23622,Sheldon,Well right now Penny’s imagination is running wild but if they meet that will eliminate the mystery and alleviate her fears. Like when that Sparkletts guy let me look under his eye patch.
23623,Leonard,Oh yeah look at that.
23624,Leonard,Wait a minute so the eye patch and the insults worked?
23625,Raj,Hey.
23626,Leonard,No no.
23627,Leonard,Yeah mm-hmm.
23628,Raj,No.
23629,Leonard,Are you okay?
23630,Sheldon,After much deliberation we’ve determined that a turtle is the ideal pet. They don’t shed fur they don’t make noise.
23631,Howard,Okey dokey let’s roll. Alright it’s time to raise the roof. Oo-ooh oo-ooh.
23632,Raj,Penny please please promise me you won’t tell anybody about this.
23633,Sheldon,Hang on. You knew that she was going to end it with me? Did you try and stop her?
23634,Leonard,Well hand it over so I can open it.
23635,Leonard,That.
23636,Penny,So sit next to me.
23637,Leonard,What is there to explain it’s all right here it’s a betrayal.
23639,Sheldon,So when could we start?
23640,Leonard,Butterfly could’ve gotten himself home from Arizona.
23641,Penny,Sheldon what the hell are you doing?
23642,Leonard,They’ve been in there like half an hour.
23643,Howard,Dude that’s my sister you’re talking about.
23644,Leonard,Fine. Howard what do you do?
23645,Sheldon,Raj show some compassion. Those are things that we think but don’t say.
23646,Sheldon,In this context with me means for me.
23648,Leonard,Oh come on!
23649,Sheldon,I knew it! PS3 definitely  PS3 who would pick a mountain bike?
23650,Penny,God are you trying to make Amy jealous?
23651,Leonard,Uh it turns out my grandfather had died.  
23652,Leonard,How you doing?
23653,Raj,Uh wait can I come with you? My character died.
23654,Howard,Ah yes Dr Patel good man.
23655,Sheldon,Will you at least go with me to the restroom here so you can open the door and flush the urinal?
23656,Leonard,You do what you want I’m not touching another man’s honey tree.
23657,Raj,Hey Stuart is the Wil Wheaton signed up for the mystic warlords tournament THE Wil Wheaton from Star Trek?
23658,Howard,My stomach. Indian food doesn’t agree with me. Ironic isn’t it?
23659,Leonard,I was wrong this is exactly like Knight Rider.
23660,Leonard,That’s stupid. Why?
23662,Penny,Okay thankyou.
23663,Penny,Okay it’s your game. You go first.
23664,Sheldon,What? He said he was fine.
23665,Sheldon,You know it occurs to me you could solve all your problems by obtaining more money.
23666,Howard,I thought we were going to be gentle with him.
23667,Sheldon,No. Jamba Juice is for heroes. And that’s what we’re going to be.
23668,Sheldon,Gentlemen I have the solution to our Comic-Con problem. We don’t need them. I’m starting my own convention.
23669,Penny,Hey I don’t think she’s wrong about you going too slow in the relationship.
23670,Raj,I think you’re very nice as well.
23671,Sheldon,It does indeed. Leonard is it awkward being here with Penny given that you recently proposed to her?
23672,Howard,Pushover.
23673,Sheldon,But I sense you’re going to and I don’t want to hear about it. Excuse me.
23675,Raj,Well I texted you but you didn’t respond. Leonard and Penny were arguing.
23676,Sheldon,Before you say yes it’s not the movie about the big dog.
23677,Leonard,Oh we have to use the stairs.
23678,Sheldon,Oh what fun. We’re like hippies at a love-in.
23679,Leonard,See? He doesn’t mind.
23680,Howard,He’s been murdered by someone in this room.
23681,Penny,Okay glasses off. Find Waldo.
23682,Leonard,Well chafing right?
23683,Raj,Okay I think we should do it right now.
23684,Raj,Ooh we could have one of those retreats.
23685,Leonard,Good good. Well you kids have fun tonight.
23686,Leonard,It’s a joke.
23687,Leonard,Right. Right. So how you doing?
23688,Sheldon,Well I didn’t make you waddle up four flights of stairs for the heck of it.
23689,Leonard,I think Sheldon really misses Amy.
23690,Penny,All right you guys uh get settled in then we’ll go across the hall and say hi to everyone.
23691,Howard,Excuse me hello? My parents are trying to marry me off to a total stranger what am I going to do?
23692,Penny,Well I’m in. When are we going?
23693,Penny,The heart wants what the heart wants Leonard.
23694,Howard,Why are you telling me about my own culture?
23695,Howard,Sure.
23696,Raj,Yeah.
23697,Raj,I don’t believe you you’re lying to me.
23698,Sheldon,Did you know the beret is an example of piece of women’s fashion adapted from male military uniforms? Another fascinating example is the epaulet.
23699,Howard,As long as we’re apologising Sheldon I I’m sorry I used your toothbrush.
23701,Penny,What is the truth?
23702,Leonard,That’s not fair. You’re not even a physicist.
23703,Penny,Leonard you said I only had to ask questions.
23704,Penny,You do that?
23705,Leonard,So?
23706,Leonard,Yeah?
23707,Sheldon,Squeaky wheel gets the grease?
23708,Sheldon,Thank you. It just it came to me one morning in the shower.
23709,Raj,These cards have barcodes on them. The wand is a reader. It’s transmitting to your phone.
23710,Howard,Well this is not for me this is for the baby. Some day she’s gonna want to see this.
23711,Leonard,Yes it’s true. The last time I brought it up you had an emotional breakdown and got on a train and ran away.
23712,Raj,Oh if only I had his confidence. I have such difficulty speaking to women. Or around women. Or at times even effeminate men.
23713,Leonard,I’m coming! 
23714,Penny,Bye Sheldon.
23715,Leonard,Thanks for letting me try out your motorcycle.
23716,Sheldon,Bishop to queen four level two. Check.
23717,Sheldon,Well if you’re going to serve Cornish game hen you should either be familiar with the history of Cornwall or be prepared to learn it.
23718,Sheldon,Were you distracted by the possibility that Koothrappali might have intercourse with Penny tonight?
23719,Sheldon,Little kid Hominids perhaps.  Is this your entire job? Your parents must be so proud.
23720,Leonard,So listen there was something I was hoping to float past you.
23722,Raj,Please take me back. Our love was meant to be.
23723,Howard,Preach.
23724,Howard,Dude if you’re going to be an astronaut you need to pick a cool nickname.
23725,Leonard,Mom please save something for the toast.
23726,Penny,Oh yeah. Sure. Just one sec?
23727,Howard,May I have your attention please? We are hear tonight to celebrate the upcoming nuptials of my best friend Howard Wolowitz.
23728,Leonard,I don’t want to talk to Amy.
23729,Sheldon,I’d like to discuss this party that Amy and Bernadette are throwing. Since you and I are both reluctant to go I think I’ve come up with a perfect way for us to enjoy it.
23730,Penny,Okay.
23731,Sheldon,I don’t know what your odds are in the world as a whole but as far as the population of this car goes you’re a veritable Mack Daddy.
23732,Leonard,Oh thanks I thought I had more.
23733,Sheldon,This is not the time for joking. We’re doing serious research which requires complete and utter focus.
23734,Howard,She feeds him out of her own mouth?
23735,Penny,Okay just give me that. Amy broke up with Sheldon she got her ears pierced and she made us eat penis cookies. Hang on. She wants to talk to you.
23736,Sheldon,Yes. I accept this five-week mission to share a living space with my girlfriend.
23737,Leonard,Well it took him a long time to get comfortable around me too.
23738,Howard,Excuse me I’m meeting a girl here. It’s kind of our first date.
23739,Sheldon,So messed up.
23740,Raj,Yes. Where I can be jealous of the cup touching your ruby lips. Or you just write it for me.
23741,Sheldon,Yeah I was but after talking to Penny I realised something. I first she’s trying much harder to stay attractive in this relationship than you are. And second the reason I may not be progressing in my research is I’ve created too pleasant of an environment for myself.
23742,Raj,Good night.
23743,Raj,Congratulations.
23744,Howard,In my fanny pack.
23745,Sheldon,That is your opinion.
23746,Raj,Sure.
23747,Penny,Oh that’s awful.
23748,Sheldon,Zandor Wizard of the North. Ha! I win.
23749,Penny,Hey you know Raj is dating a doctor who works a lot. Him and his mom have a type. You you got to laugh at that right? No? All right.
23750,Sheldon,Because most of the things I’m planning to buy haven’t been invented yet.
23751,Raj,All right. Would you mind if I went to your room and downloaded some Asian pornography?
23752,Raj,Hey bud.
23753,Howard,Alright why don’t we do it your way then? We’ll arrange for this girl to move in across the hall from Dennis so he can pathetically moon over her for months on end.
23754,Sheldon,Oh dear.
23755,Leonard,Oh we tried kissing but the earth didn’t move. I mean any more than the 383 miles that it was going to move anyway.
23756,Leonard,Oh that sounds romantic.
23757,Leonard,So you’re okay talking about this?
23759,Leonard,Yeah they are.
23760,Penny,Yeah come on in. What’s up?
23761,Howard,Hi.
23762,Leonard,What if she just comes over?
23763,Raj,“Kandorian dry cl…” I give up you can’t have a rational argument with this man.
23764,Leonard,Why would you do that?
23765,Penny,Okay can you just let me in.
23766,Leonard,Yes you should go ahead say it.
23767,Sheldon,Do you know it’s amazing how many supervillains have advanced degrees. Graduate school should probably do a better job of screening those people out.
23768,Penny,I don’t know. I kind of got the sense she didn’t like me.
23769,Raj,Ooh Sock Mouth’s got him on the ropes.
23770,Penny,Oh hey Leonard. I see you met my dad.
23771,Sheldon,Amy? Wake up.
23772,Sheldon,Given the cards that have already been played Penny can only be holding necromancer potions which are only effective against wraiths and day-walkers and there are no more of either left to be drawn. The cards remaining in the undrawn stack are four fire weapons a troll two ogres and the jewel of Osiris.
23773,Leonard,Okay fine I’m I’m a horrible human being I’m the Darth Vader of Pasadena.
23774,Sheldon,I want to say no but it’s too glorious. Get in here.
23775,Penny,Ah thank you!
23776,Howard,Oh my God. She’s not gonna bathe me is she?
23777,Leonard,On our Quidditch team he…
23778,Penny,Oh no it’s fine you got most of it out the window.
23779,Leonard,Maybe. We enter the dungeon.
23780,Raj,I need to rub my genitals on their prototype.
23781,Leonard,She’s heard about you because we’re you know involved and you haven’t heard about her because… I never slept with her I swear!
23782,Sheldon,In the lab?
23783,Sheldon,That’s pretty funny that does sound like me. But that doesn’t mean that you should be standing on street corners handing out your math to whatever guy comes along.
23785,Sheldon,Oh I see why you’re confused. No her news sounded important but what you’re forgetting is it was an achievement in the field of biology. That’s all about yucky squishy things.
23786,Leonard,I have a job.
23787,Raj,My Incredible Hulk hands signed by Stan Lee.
23788,Raj,Looks good.
23789,Penny,Why should I worry?
23790,Sheldon,I knew I should have given my Pope the jet pack.
23792,Leonard,You’re pregnant?
23793,Sheldon,Don’t Sheldon me. We ordered for five people not six.
23794,Sheldon,Yes while also getting in a solid dig at you. Pretty efficient huh?
23795,Penny,Okay look here page 58. I oil-wrestle an orang-utan in a bikini.
23796,Leonard,Okay. Star Trek the original series the Enterprise was on a five-year mission to explore new worlds. Think of this as your personal five-week mission to do the same.
23797,Howard,Hey.
23798,Sheldon,Lamda equals one over Pi R squared N
23799,Howard,Good good. Uh listen I just wanted to let you know when you get my credit card bill it might be a little high this month.
23800,Howard,It’s a gravitational wobble. It could be a sign of an extrasolar planet that may contain life and someday be named after me.
23801,Raj,Wow. What did you tell them?
23802,Penny,Oh you’re inviting me over to eat?
23803,Sheldon,It’s how they lure you in. I believe it’s called bait and switch.
23804,Howard,You’re impossible.
23805,Sheldon,I don’t understand. How could we all live together if I’m not there?
23806,Penny,It’s not interesting. It’s incredibly insulting.
23807,Leonard,We covered this I’m dumb.
23808,Penny,Well while we’re all awake why don’t we go to a diner or something?
23809,Raj,Your mom creeps the hell out of me.
23810,Penny,Are you really that kind of guy?
23811,Penny,I got asked to sign autographs there.
23812,Sheldon,I think metaphorically. But he was in the bathroom for a while.
23813,Howard,Thank you.
23814,Leonard,Oh come on. The only reason you’re the lead author is because we went alphabetically.
23815,Penny,Sorry.
23817,Sheldon, Penny.
23818,Penny,Okay well let’s just see what else you have. Okay here take this and this and this and these.
23819,Sheldon,Nice motivational speech from our lead guitarist.
23820,Leonard,Who are these people?
23821,Leonard,Hey I made French toast sticks.
23822,Leonard,What about my robot poster?
23824,Howard,Wait I don’t understand. They didn’t find the element?
23825,Sheldon,Yummy. And warm on my back.
23826,Sheldon, Amy. I made a commitment in writing to comfort you in times like this. Additionally you are my girlfriend and I care about your well-being.
23828,Sheldon,Let’s sit somewhere else.
23829,Leonard,You’re kidding. He’s still alive?
23830,Sheldon,It’s called carpal tunnel syndrome and quite frankly you deserve it.
23831,Leonard,You know what? Go put on your bus pants.
23832,Penny,Amy come on…
23833,Penny,Yeah. I guess.
23834,Penny,Hi. Penny. So it’s your motorcycle?
23835,Raj,Do you want to hang out tomorrow night maybe grab a bite to eat or catch a late movie?
23836,Sheldon,Why?
23837,Leonard,Seven.
23838,Penny,Uh Stuart has a piece in an art show that’s opening tonight.
23839,Penny,Hey guys.
23840,Raj,No. Just the drawer.
23841,Howard,That was all a lie? This year’s gifts are already wrapped!
23842,Raj,That is so offensive. Does everything you know about Hinduism come from Indiana Jones?
23843,Sheldon,Always.
23844,Sheldon,Can you recommend a surface you haven’t had coitus on?
23845,Raj,No you didn’t. I did.
23846,Howard,Hold on. I’m talking to an orc under the bridge in Thunder Bluff who says if we pay him he’ll help us track down your things.
23847,Penny,What?
23848,Raj,I don’t think my character should be in a place like this. Everyone’s undressing her with their eyes.
23850,Leonard,I wouldn’t be bored. Why would I be bored?
23851,Penny,It makes him desperate to please women. That’s why the foreplay goes on and on.
23852,Leonard,I really doubt that’s what he’ll serve.
23853,Penny,Alright well great seeing you.
23854,Penny,When were you going to tell me?
23855,Leonard,Do you want the fire extinguisher?
23856,Raj,Okay well I’m just trying to help you.
23857,Raj,Come on dude I’m exhausted and Tyra Banks says the most important item in your makeup bag is a good night’s sleep.
23858,Raj,You mean a moo-stache?
23859,Raj,Speaking of untouchables I’ve got great news for you guys. People magazine is having a reception this Saturday and I managed to get you invited.
23860,Leonard,Okay yeah um do you remember when you accused me of trying to sabotage our wedding?
23861,Howard,Got a hot girlfriend now. I want the haters to know.
23862,Penny,Okay did you go to the dirty store or Michaels?
23863,Sheldon,Yes but are the costumes random or genre specific?
23864,Leonard,Sheldon you really need to find a better way of dealing with Penny.
23865,Howard,Damn.
23866,Howard,Seriously? I’m heartbroken and you’re hitting on me?
23867,Leonard,No. That’s not what he meant.
23868,Penny,So you’ve got a bit of competition I really don’t see what the big deal is.
23869,Penny,I know. Next time I get pulled over for a speeding ticket here come the waterworks.
23870,Sheldon,Uh yes but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth knows to pick up their refrigerated foods on the way out of the supermarket.
23871,Leonard,I didn’t even have to take my glasses off/
23872,Howard,Hello Emily.
23873,Penny,Oh my that’s it. Get out.
23874,Leonard,One sec. Hey. Sorry.
23875,Raj,Yeah just leave me out of it. You know if they come here and see crap everywhere they’re just gonna blame the Indian guy.
23876,Leonard,Please oh please just let me be there.
23877,Sheldon,Oh. Would you care to play an ocean-themed game I invented?
23878,Howard,Howard wait. Why don’t you use this instead of the PVC to keep the transverse filter assembly in place?
23879,Leonard,Okay um well there was this girl.
23880,Sheldon,But.
23881,Leonard,So?
23882,Sheldon,When we played chess earlier you were terrific and I can’t wait to play you again. Goodnight.
23883,Leonard,Seems like a lot of trouble for a hug.
23884,Penny,Yeah I mean not to the same people but…
23885,Penny,I said hey want to come over and hang out?
23886,Leonard,Maybe we should take a step back.
23887,Sheldon,Ye who now will bless the poor shall yourselves find blessing. Ba-da-bum.
23888,Leonard,It’d actually be nice to not hear Sheldon complain about my cooking all day.
23889,Sheldon,Face to face? Are you going to wait for him to sit down or are you going to stand on a coffee table?
23890,Leonard,What is it?
23891,Leonard,Are you sure?
23893,Sheldon,Chicken broth. It seemed culturally appropriate. Also there was a single cube of chicken bouillon in the cupboard when I moved in and it’s been bothering me for the last eight years. So as they say two birds.
23894,Howard,We could play outside.
23895,Sheldon,Don’t get soft on me Hofstadter. I will slap those glasses right off your face.
23896,Sheldon,I like cows.
23897,Sheldon,Stealing is against the law!
23898,Leonard,Right fine. I’ll tell Howard you didn’t come because you’re more concerned about your own well-being than his.
23899,Penny,Oh yes. Hi Mary.
23900,Howard,Dude I am so sorry.
23901,Leonard,Look Howard I’d say there’s a lot of fish in the sea but I watched you dangle your hook in the water for years. Do not throw her back.
23902,Sheldon,Spicy mustard from the Korean deli?
23903,Raj,Oh come on. What’s the worst that could come of this meeting?
23904,Penny,Wow that is a lot of people jammed in there.
23905,Raj,Well that doesn’t seem fair.
23906,Leonard,Well yeah it’s true. You you are a god to me.
23908,Sheldon,Make it so.
23909,Leonard,Yeah see now I feel terrible like I’m being selfish and holding you back. What? Say something. Yeah that is pretty annoying.
23910,Sheldon,All right get this. Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard.
23911,Penny,Wait wait what am I going to do?
23912,Sheldon,He can’t kill me even if I turn.
23913,Sheldon,Mm. You seem to be forgetting the no nostalgia clause.
23914,Penny,Yeah sure. Yay!
23915,Leonard,Bernadette told Howard Howard told me plus I can see all my stuff is gone.
23916,Sheldon,The answer’s tricky. It’s Second Street. You see you’d think it would be First Street but in most towns First Street eventually gets renamed to something else you know like Main Street Broad Street Michigan Avenue. Leonard and I often use our commute time to exercise our minds  with brain-teasers like that. We also play games. Would you like to play one?
23917,Sheldon,Well everyone will think I’m weird.
23918,Penny,Okay.
23919,Howard,Just to be clear financially or mid-sentence?
23920,Penny,No I didn’t get it.
23921,Sheldon,But which one of us should be the party who…
23922,Sheldon,And since you’re green this time I can be it next time.
23923,Leonard,Fourteen dollars huh?
23924,Penny,Ubif Lubenubard tubold hubim ubit’s pubossubibuble.
23925,Penny,No come on. This is serious.
23926,Sheldon,I no that is preposterous. Maybe.
23927,Sheldon,I’m listening amuse me.
23928,Sheldon,Well wait. This is our first fight as a couple who live together.
23929,Sheldon,Strongly disagree. Go on.
23930,Penny,Well this is a moisturizing mask.
23931,Raj,You fooled me with that goat at the petting zoo. You will not fool me again.
23932,Howard,Well can I say she looks nice?
23933,Leonard,You’re both acting like lunatics. It’s just a parking spot.
23934,Raj,My parents’ money. Uh what did you put for your best feature?
23935,Leonard,It’s not just Howard and Bernadette. I mean look how far we’ve all come.
23936,Leonard,I know someone who would disagree.
23938,Penny,Sweetie did you have a bad dream?
23939,Sheldon,All right that seems simple enough. Initiating calibration sequence. One two three four five six seven eight nine ten. Well I suppose ten is technically at least ten. But they’re still getting at least one angry letter.
23940,Leonard,Screw you guys. I’m gonna go see if she’s home.
23941,Sheldon,It is isn’t it? Oh bother. Isn’t that just always the way? You go to staple something and you’re out of staples. Gosh I wish I’d known that earlier today when I was at Staples.
23942,Leonard,Don’t panic this is better.
23943,Howard,Now let’s do some sexy glamour shots. I’ll set the mood.  Oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz Yeah nice one oontz oontz. That’s right. Oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz…
23944,Leonard,No.
23945,Penny,Hard to believe but go on.
23946,Penny,Yeah and the bag it came in.
23947,Leonard,Good evening ladies and gentlemen. My name is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter and it is my very great honour to introduce the winner of this year’s Chancellor’s award for Science and my good friend Dr. Sheldon Cooper. But before I do I’d like to share with you a letter from Sheldon’s mother who couldn’t be here tonight. Isn’t that nice? His mother sent him a letter. She’s proud of him. I wonder what that feels like. Dear Shelly. That’s what she calls him. Shelly it’s a pet name. You know what my mother’s pet name for me is? Leonard. But I digress. Dear Shelly. I am so proud of… 
23948,Sheldon,Okay um what do you say to a graduate of the UC Berkeley physics department? I’ll have fries with that. Because his education hasn’t prepared him for a career in the sciences.
23949,Penny,You know some people try visualization.
23950,Raj,I’ll give you a hundred dollars which will make me half owner and we’ll put it on my balcony.
23951,Sheldon,I was found guilty and fined $533.
23952,Leonard,You’re welcome.
23953,Sheldon,Give me one good reason why not.
23954,Sheldon,Sheldon. Sheldon Cooper.
23955,Leonard,Well roomie it’s only one night a week but it’s a start.
23956,Penny,Yeah but I don’t think that’s going to happen in a documentary about the Holocaust.
23957,Raj,You can’t let this stop you. Almost any scientific advancement can be used for destructive purposes.
23958,Sheldon,Great. I’ve been doing some reading about vehicular safety. Did you know that the highest number of drowning accidents happen on or around boats?
23959,Sheldon,I want you to be happy too but not enough to do anything about it.
23960,Leonard,What?
23961,Leonard,He’s in his bedroom.
23962,Sheldon,A girls night? Oh I don’t know if I’m up for an evening talking about rainbows unicorns and menstrual cramps.
23963,Sheldon,A Swedish team of physicists is trying to scoop our super-fluid vortex experiment.
23964,Penny,Uh we know that… Newton was a really smart cookie. Oh! Is that where Fig Newtons come from?
23965,Penny,Shut up.
23966,Leonard,I’m just gonna take my bacon grease and slide over there.
23967,Sheldon,Okay you got it. See I was afraid it was a thinker.
23968,Penny,Thankyou Sheldon.
23969,Raj,Yeah I I I saw that article you’re talking about. Uh the participants ask each other a series of questions designed to promote intimacy.
23970,Penny,Hi you guys got a minute?
23971,Sheldon,No thank you. (Sees insect. More appear and swarm all over him. He jumps out of a daydream on his own couch. Jumps up and runs out to Penny’s apartment.
23972,Sheldon,We could put her stereo back there.
23973,Leonard,No I said animalistic. Of course we’re all animals but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree.
23974,Raj,The space probe.
23975,Penny,Thank you. 
23976,Leonard,You’re gonna have to be more specific.
23977,Sheldon,It was so good.
23979,Sheldon,Well I’ve spent the last three hours in an online debate in the DC Comics Batman chatroom and I need your help.
23980,Leonard,What are these?
23981,Penny,Um Howard can I see you for a minute please?
23982,Sheldon,Okay I’m sleepy now get out.
23983,Sheldon,Before you begin let me say again how deeply sorry I am for my earlier behaviour and how much I respect and admire your leadership.
23984,Howard,Ooh!
23985,Penny,Ugh. Well lucky for you there’s nothing else to do right now.
23986,Raj,Let’s see. Six. That’s pretty cool I have six friends. Kind of like Sinatra.
23987,Howard,There’s the house freeze frame freeze frame.
23988,Leonard,Oh hey.
23989,Howard,And right here.
23990,Penny,So how was work today?
23991,Sheldon,I’ll know.
23992,Raj,Religion is a very personal thing. I do go to temple I just I don’t talk about it.
23993,Leonard,What? You’re kidding!
23994,Sheldon,It’s called non-fiction for a reason Leonard.
23995,Penny,Okay new salon topic. Salons dumb thing from a long time ago or interesting thing made dumb by talking about superheroes? Discuss.
23996,Leonard,Green Lantern.
23997,Sheldon,Good thinking. Perhaps I’ll check the perimeter and make some warm milk.
23998,Penny,Eww.
23999,Howard,That is so offensive. Does everything you know about Hinduism come from Indiana Jones?
24000,Leonard,Alright this is cruel we better let him finish before his head explodes.
24001,Sheldon,Some what? Oh yes some sexual intercourse.
24002,Sheldon,Time. Alright Klingons pencils down.
24003,Sheldon,No one said anything of the kind to Neil Armstrong the entire nation dedicated a decade of effort and treasure to put a man on the moon.
24004,Raj,So I was reading how it’s a good idea for new parents to take an infant CPR class.
24005,Sheldon,Let’s see.  Snake eyes. Sorry bud.
24006,Penny,Well haven’t really talked about it yet but I figure at some point I’ll move in with him or he’ll move in with me.
24007,Sheldon,Boy some people are just glass-half-empty.
24008,Penny,Yeah you’re right. You know you’re really sensitive about this kind of stuff.
24009,Sheldon,Where are you going to go?
24010,Leonard,It was?
24011,Sheldon,And I’m sure some fool in the Donner party said the snow would stop any day now. I like to think they ate him first.
24012,Leonard,Hey Penny um since you’re already gonna be at the airport do I need to go?
24013,Raj,You’re really going to do this?
24014,Leonard,Yeah well I’m just glad to be a part of it. So what happens now?
24015,Leonard,No come on now we’re going out.
24016,Sheldon, Penny.
24017,Penny,Not really.
24018,Sheldon,He’s still mad.
24019,Sheldon,When I rise to power those people will be sterilized.
24020,Sheldon,Well it’s not like I’m never going to see you two again. Which brings us to article 23 subsection C please check here to reserve your spot at the ten year roommate reunion.
24021,Sheldon,Which I also figured out by myself.
24022,Sheldon,But this is my birthday suit. Are you having a stroke? Because that’s the kind of thing that just ruins a birthday party.
24023,Leonard,What’s the big deal? Raj bailed so we could use some extra players.
24024,Penny,We’re good thank you.
24025,Sheldon,I’ll stipulate to that if you give me the ring.
24026,Sheldon,Yes. And until you acquire a surgical mask please address your comments to me through a napkin. We’ve been corresponding for years about our mutual interest in gravitational wave signatures of inflatons in the early universe. And now she’s under consideration for a position at our university.
24027,Howard,That’s a cute age. They can do so many things.
24028,Penny,Shake it baby.
24029,Penny,I am.
24030,Sheldon,You know what? I’m proud of us. Yeah with Penny and Leonard taking in Raj and Stuart living with Howard and Bernadette we’re the only couple of our social group who doesn’t need to fill the holes in their relationship with a third party.
24031,Howard,You’re a good son. I don’t know how you do it.
24032,Leonard,Oh I found a scratch-and-sniff book about wine tasting. It teaches the different flavour notes to look for.
24033,Howard,Um Expedition 31 will launch this spring to the International Space Station. Crew members will include Commander Tom ‘Tombo’ Johnson astronaut Mike ‘Supernova’ Novacelik and Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz.
24034,Howard,Yeah me neither.
24035,Sheldon,I know. I like him too. Hi little guy. How’d you like to come home with us? You’ll be living with me because we don’t live in the same house.
24036,Leonard,Well you’re about to be in an even better one. I didn’t want to say anything until I knew for sure but I’ve been re-running the tests on your element in my lab and I disproved it. Your element does not exist.
24037,Sheldon,Yeah well you may change your mind when you hear that this is the new expanded edition which contains a more complete map of Middle Earth now including the Haradwaith Territories.
24038,Sheldon,I’ve never said these words before but good job Howard!
24039,Sheldon,Hi.
24040,Leonard,Yeah. You get the paint I’ll rest for 30 to 40 minutes and then we do this.
24041,Howard,Dad.
24042,Raj,Three.
24043,Penny,Does it really say that?
24044,Leonard,Cinnamon. Give me another one.
24046,Leonard,Then Amy got mad and left?
24047,Leonard,Yes we did I just came from it.
24048,Sheldon,You know what? I feel uncomfortable engaging in a public display of affection while their relationship is strained.
24049,Howard,I have to feel sorry for myself. I’m the only one who cares. Just like I’m the only one who’ll have sex with me.
24050,Howard,Hey guys.
24051,Leonard,Take me to a bar with women.
24052,Sheldon,You wouldn’t make jokes if you could feel the way I feel.
24053,Penny,What?
24054,Leonard,Great. So how’d it go with Stuart last night?
24055,Sheldon,A I rarely kid. And B when I do kid you will know it by my use of the word bazinga.
24056,Sheldon,Keep the table. We don’t use that space.
24057,Leonard,You know what? Never mind. I’m going to tell him it’s okay to ask her out.
24058,Leonard,That’s really nice Sheldon I’m happy for you.
24059,Leonard,Sure.
24060,Penny,Just eat your dinner.
24061,Leonard,No we went somewhere new.
24062,Sheldon,I’ll tell you where I’ve been. You boys may have had gelato with Stan Lee and gotten autographed comics but I saw the inside of his house and got an autographed application for a restraining order.
24063,Penny,Oh wait. I remember.
24064,Howard,I still wear mine when there’s a nip in the air.
24065,Leonard,All rightie. Shirt coming off. Ta-da! Man nipples.
24066,Raj,Busting you.
24067,Penny,Okay one more time?
24068,Sheldon,No no no no. She’d be going alone. Well if you think I’m afraid of birds you should see me around sheep.
24069,Howard,Nothing. I was just calling to check in make sure she’s doing okay.
24070,Howard,Good idea. Bernadette?
24071,Sheldon,What are the odds that two individuals as unique as ourselves would be connected by someone as comparatively workaday as your son?
24072,Penny,Yes he was! He thought you were gonna blow up the moon!
24073,Leonard,It’s Leonard.
24074,Penny,Oh gosh Amy. I don’t know if I would call this an actual slumber party.
24075,Sheldon,I have plenty of experience in biology. I bought a Tamagotchi in 1998. And it’s still alive. Let’s do this.
24076,Penny,Yes but I don’t think she wants to see you.
24077,Sheldon,Morning.
24078,Leonard,You want to come watch?
24080,Howard,So why did you guys even agree to the deadline?
24081,Leonard,He just made her laugh something’s wrong.
24082,Leonard,When the transvestite lived here you didn’t care how he kept the place.
24083,Sheldon,Better.
24084,Leonard,Okay yeah he’s stupid.
24085,Howard,No. It’s just one of those times when it’s just you and me. Like when the three of us went to the movies and you and I waited outside the bathroom while Howard threw up Red Vines and Cherry Coke. Do you remember that?
24086,Howard,If it’s thank you for the home made jam you got in December congratulations you’re the first one.
24087,Leonard,Yes please.
24088,Sheldon,Wait it’s not all pants there’s one shirt.
24089,Raj,I’ll do it.
24090,Leonard,You know so we can go into this with no secrets between us.
24091,Leonard,Excuse me. What the hell is wrong with you?
24092,Penny,Alright you guys good luck.
24093,Sheldon,Do you think there comes a point in life when it stops feeling bad to be left out of things?
24094,Raj,Wow. It’s an antique sextant. Sailors used these to find their position by the stars.
24095,Penny,Oh no no no. I’ve had way too much already.
24096,Leonard,She’s a delightful woman. You’ll love her.
24097,Howard,I’m sorry for bothering you. I’ll hang up now.
24098,Raj,Excuse me.
24099,Sheldon,All right. Well I’m going to perform full backup reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems.
24100,Sheldon,Yeah and on top of that Leonard has the audacity to suggest that now that he and Penny are engaged he may not want to live with me any more.
24101,Penny,I think it implies that the elevator doesn’t work.
24102,Sheldon,Sarcasm?
24103,Howard,What is she doing in a comic book store?
24104,Leonard,I didn’t make it back. The ship sank I’m in hell.
24105,Penny,Hello.
24106,Howard,I was but it’s their anniversary and I didn’t want to be a third wheel so I figured I’d come over here and hang out with you and Penny on your date.
24107,Sheldon,No I just I got a little light-headed.
24108,Leonard,What’s the matter?
24109,Penny,Like who?
24110,Sheldon,Oh Lord I’m in Jewish hell.
24111,Raj,Yeah you didn’t have to buy groceries ’cause you were breast-feeding.
24112,Sheldon,As good? You just got pantsed in the schoolyard four-eyes.
24113,Sheldon,Is it my fault that my name came first on the paper alphabetically?
24114,Penny,Nope. I have no reason to… “B” mad at you. Minus.
24115,Sheldon,Fascinating.
24116,Raj,I’m just saying we don’t know who this guy is. What if he wants to steal our money or our kidneys or make a suit outof our skins?
24117,Howard,I have a surprise for you. Cover your eyes. Open them. It’s a real ruby. It was a little expensive but no one can put a price on love. Although the people at Cartier took a pretty good shot at it.  Oh Mummy Daddy. What a nice surprise.
24118,Penny,And?
24119,Sheldon,Keys! Keys! Keys!
24120,Leonard,Uh these are strong you should slow down.
24121,Leonard,What are you doing?
24122,Penny,All right standard state fair pie-eating contest rules are no hands first one to clean the pan wins.
24123,Penny,Why not?
24124,Sheldon,Okay. Ooh this is different hmm? Candles and music.
24125,Penny,No of course not.
24126,Penny,So you think I’ll be on TV and in movies and win awards.
24127,Penny,Yeah.
24128,Raj,Are you turning it the right way?
24129,Penny,And he’s back in the closet.
24130,Howard,Boy what I wouldn’t give to get her out of those pants and into something a little more stylish.
24131,Penny,He really seems into her.
24132,Leonard,If we have extra we’ll just take the leftovers home.
24133,Sheldon,Right just one thing before we start.
24134,Penny,No you don’t.
24135,Penny,And now me.
24136,Leonard,Uh there it goes it sticks I’m sorry.
24137,Leonard,You’re going out of your way to talk to that guy because I said we weren’t on a date.
24138,Penny,Nines or tens?
24139,Penny,Can you believe when I met you I was 22? I mean it’s crazy. Where did all that time go?
24140,Leonard,Coming. Hey lovebug.
24141,Raj,Sheldon that’s my water.
24142,Sheldon,Because of the two additional Ethernet ports.
24143,Penny,Ooh. Leonard Hofstadter will you marry me?
24144,Penny,What the hell are you doing? Howard is your best friend and that is his girlfriend. You should be ashamed of yourself.
24145,Sheldon,We better choose a name no one can make fun of. Sir Frederick William Herschel didn’t do Uranus any favours.
24146,Penny,No you didn’t. Look you are a great guy and it is things you love that make you who you are.
24147,Howard,Excuse me but I think you’re missing a big opportunity here.
24148,Raj,Yes Mummy was right. American girls are sexually voracious devils.
24150,Howard,I had no idea tortilla chips were such a good fuel source.
24151,Penny,Well then you get it.
24152,Leonard,Good.
24153,Leonard,Just relax it’s a joke. You don’t have hormones.
24154,Raj,Dude if we do this we’re gonna need a cool band name.
24155,Sheldon,What do you mean?
24156,Sheldon,Or the one. Dammit I’ll do it.
24157,Sheldon,But I made it better.
24158,Sheldon,For what it’s worth I thought it was humorous.
24159,Howard,You’d think it’d be because my parents didn’t love me but actually they loved me a great deal.
24160,Leonard,Come on Penny.
24161,Penny,So you just left them alone playing games in your house?
24162,Sheldon,Oh he’ll be back. Wine and a girl in the dark he’s gonna be bored out of his mind.
24164,Sheldon,You’ll get ’em next time.
24165,Sheldon,On Sunday?
24166,Sheldon,I have the same problem with him. My theory is that his lack of focus stems from an over-developed sex drive.
24167,Howard,I don’t know. Do you think this is really Hillary Clinton doing it with Oprah?
24168,Sheldon,Were you hoping we would because it’s prom?
24169,Raj,There are no rules in hell!
24170,Howard,Hey this pregnancy had an emotionally-needy third wheel way before you came along.
24172,Leonard,This ring.
24173,Sheldon,Nah she’s a good kid.
24174,Howard,Oh good. Namaste Grandpa.
24175,Sheldon,4.1855 times ten to the seventh ergs per calorie.
24176,Sheldon,In general yes.
24177,Sheldon,Yeah darn straight you can’t. Try to tell a grown man to go to sleep.
24178,Sheldon,I remember it perfectly. But I have an eidetic memory. If you’re interested I also remember how much you owe us for the food.
24179,Penny,Oh that’s a good question. How about awkward?
24180,Leonard,Uh I’ve been looking for a Professor Sharpe?
24182,Leonard,Here you go.
24183,Sheldon,Hello.
24184,Howard,Wrong smarty-pants. It’s Everything Is Awesome from The Lego Movie.
24185,Leonard,What for? It’s not going to rain.
24186,Sheldon,Ugh it’s like walking into the Amazon. And not the good Amazon with one-day shipping. The awful one with birds and snakes.
24187,Sheldon,Flags.
24188,Sheldon,You can. I’m happy when you come home. And I’m scared of fireworks. By the way on July Fourth we’re all sleeping here.
24189,Sheldon,It’s not a home. It’s a senior centre.  We’d never put Meemaw in a home!
24190,Sheldon,It’s kind of spooky.
24191,Leonard,Why don’t you just lie down on the floor and swim there?
24192,Raj,She’s curvy and she owns it. I like that.
24193,Leonard,There you go Pad Thai no peanuts.
24194,Penny,You were wearing her bra.
24195,Sheldon,It’s culturally universal a bed even a temporary bed is always oriented with the headboard away from the door. It serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders.
24196,Sheldon,You hit me. You saw him he hit me.
24197,Leonard,You don’t want that do you?
24198,Leonard,Excuse me but I think I’m just as qualified as you are.
24199,Leonard,Of course not.
24200,Leonard,Trust me you’ll be fine. See ya.
24201,Penny,Nothing. Okay well it sounds like things are going to work out.
24202,Sheldon,Yes.
24203,Howard,Are you going to let me tell the story or not?
24204,Sheldon,Well I’m sorry about Leonard. Thought I raised him better than that.
24205,Raj,It was for the girls. They broke up with me I don’t care if they get fat.
24206,Raj,Oh so kind of like what’s happening with Penny right now.
24207,Sheldon,I did. He said and I quote ask Penny it was her cockamamie idea.
24208,Leonard,Well what happened? We’ve been sitting here all night and the longest conversation you’ve had with a woman was when your mom called.
24210,Sheldon,Of course. Ask a silly question.
24211,Leonard,Thank you.
24212,Penny,I can’t get the damned key out.
24213,Raj,Penny is wearing the worst Catwoman costume I have ever seen and that includes Halle Berry’s.
24214,Sheldon,Yeah well take them apart and start with the edges. And stop wasting time.
24215,Leonard,Midnight. Really? You know what? Let’s do it.
24216,Penny,Very funny. Okay never have I ever… yeah you know what? Let’s just circle back.
24217,Raj,It’s not about that.
24218,Leonard,Well…
24219,Sheldon,Senior theoretical particle physicist at CalTech focusing on M theory or in layman’s terms string theory.
24220,Raj,Ah look at that. I have a date. I love America again.
24221,Penny,Oh Beverly I can’t talk to my boyfriend’s mother about his penis.
24222,Leonard,Um eight.  Point four.
24223,Leonard,That’s not a bad sign.
24224,Howard,Well I couldn’t have done it without my two favourite girls. Martha Stewart and Rachael Ray.
24225,Howard,She’s gonna know I was looking in it.
24226,Penny,I don’t want to spend the whole day playing a board game.
24227,Leonard,What are you idiots doing?
24228,Leonard,What?
24229,Sheldon,To be honest I did.
24230,Raj,Check.
24231,Leonard,Where?
24232,Leonard,Oh uh yeah I was trying to see if I could laugh as a woman.
24233,Leonard,Trying to have a magical night here guys.
24234,Raj,Oh my God that’s who you look like.
24235,Leonard,There’s a big difference. Arrow. Lantern.
24236,Raj,That’s very offensive.
24237,Penny,Yeah but that’s just his Earth parents. We don’t know anything about the ones that sent him here.
24238,Leonard,Huh. Okay. But my point is that you have absolutely no reason to be embarrassed.
24239,Leonard,It’s always fun watching him read someone else’s work.
24240,Howard,Uh I’ve got time booked in the telescope room all weekend scanning for rogue planets. You’re more than welcome to join me.
24241,Leonard,Uh yeah.
24242,Raj,Okay. What shall be first to taste the wrath of Monte?
24243,Leonard,Hey pal. You didn’t see me telling Kevin that you thought cold wars were only fought in winter.
24244,Leonard,Me too. So what do you think? Are we gonna get back together?
24245,Howard,I’m sorry. Honestly I didn’t think your job would bother me but I guess it did. And I hate myself for that. But there’s a lot of things about me that would totally embarrass you.
24246,Howard,And does Sheldon know you’re dating Sheldon?
24247,Penny,Fine.
24248,Penny,I think I know how to change your mind.
24249,Sheldon,No no no wait. I’m not done. Allow me to underscore my sentiment with a haunting rendition of Brenda Lee’s I’m Sorry played on the pan flute.
24250,Sheldon,Wolowitz told me he’s a big baby. But I didn’t know that and I played extract for 82 points. It’s all Amy’s fault. She told me to play it. I have got to cut her loose.
24251,Howard,She’s curvy and she owns it. I like that.
24252,Leonard,Are you hungry thirsty? Can I offer you anything?
24253,Penny,Um Raj honey you say you can’t talk to women but… you’ve been talking to me.
24254,Sheldon,Disagree. We’ve known about evolution since 1859 she still believes in Noah and his amazing zoo boat. This could have all been avoided if you’d only listened to me.
24255,Sheldon,He rejected train day.
24256,Penny,Uh did you notice your key chain?
24257,Sheldon,I believe they engaged in coitus but more importantly if Leonard had not abandoned his story would you have found it plausible?
24258,Sheldon,And yet you can’t speak to women.
24259,Leonard,Whatever. There’s no alphas here and this is your project. You’re in charge. How do you want to start?
24260,Leonard,Look I know our winter thermostat setting is 72 degrees but I’m a little warm so I’m going to turn it down.
24261,Leonard,Why didn’t you call?
24262,Raj,You should send that to Jimmy Fallon.
24263,Raj,Well you know whenever you and I would try to hit on women in bars and they’d blow us off and then we’d tell each other they were probably gay. It’s like that. Except this time it’s true.
24264,Howard,Hey what’s it like sharing a bathroom with Penny? Is there hair everywhere? Does she use your loofah?
24265,Sheldon,Thank you for my bobble head.
24266,Leonard,Well we’d better call somebody to come pick us up.
24267,Leonard,Would you be willing to read a book that concisely explains how all psychics are frauds?
24268,Penny,I just want to know why a five-year-old boy puts on his mom’s make-up and wears balloon boobies.
24269,Sheldon,Welcome to Texas.
24270,Raj,I just read a book about Oppenheimer seemed like a chance to show off.  There he is there’s my happy Hebraic homeboy. Yeah that’s the smile I’m gonna remember when you’re living in the desert and I’m living with your wife.
24271,Penny,Make this interesting? You bet money on me?
24272,Leonard,No it’s like that. Well I’m excited to show you around.
24273,Raj,How can you be so racist?
24274,Sheldon,Well one of the things.
24275,Leonard,Penny wait.  Damned contacts.
24276,Leonard,Thank you.
24277,Penny,Why not?
24278,Penny,Oh Raj.
24279,Raj,And that’s how Mommy and Daddy met.
24280,Sheldon,It’s a physical relationship too. Hand-holding hugging even on hot days. Ow. Okay here’s a new one. Apparently now we kick each other in the shin under the table. How do you like it when I do it to you? Not so much huh?
24281,Sheldon,Mmhmm. Mmhmm. It’s interesting. But isn’t ventriloquism by definition a solo activity? Yeah? Tell me another interest of yours. Hmmm. Is there any chance you like monkeys? What is wrong with you? Everybody likes monkeys. Hang on Kripke.  A loop counter? And an escape to the least objectionable activity! Howard that’s brilliant! I’m surprised you saw that.
24282,Howard,Excuse me for wanting a little magic in my life.
24283,Sheldon,That makes two of us. My new cuticle scissors will be here in one to two business days. Come on one.
24284,Sheldon,Well I was thinking about you helping me out last night  Penny.
24285,Penny,How do you not tear off his clothes and take him right here on this table?
24287,Howard,I don’t believe you you’re lying to me.
24288,Sheldon,Do we really have to go to Mrs. Wolowitz’s house?
24289,Leonard,Good?
24290,Sheldon,Am I? The mind’s a mysterious thing Leonard. He could be having the time of his life while she thinks she’s a chicken pecking for corn.
24291,Leonard,So?
24292,Raj,See what?
24293,Leonard,Next time you should open with that.
24294,Leonard,What?
24295,Leonard,Sacks sacks…
24296,Howard,I’d like to propose a toast to a rare and wonderful Sheldon-free evening.
24297,Sheldon,Look at Arthur cracking up at a joke I told him. I’ll never hear that laugh again.
24298,Penny,You’re all going?
24299,Penny,It was… okay.
24300,Penny,He’s such an angel when he’s asleep.
24301,Sheldon,Is that your final decision?
24302,Howard,On Caprica night?
24303,Raj,It’s intimate waxing. Quit looking at that.
24304,Howard,He’s right. This is an important achievement for two reasons. Number one and of course number two.
24305,Sheldon,You see Penny the Israelites were in the desert…
24306,Penny,Ooh my uncle just had a colonoscopy.
24307,Leonard,Don’t sit in his spot.
24308,Sheldon,Yes that’s right. I have Amy. In the past you’ve professed feelings for her. Does it eat you up inside that I have her and you don’t?
24309,Raj,Emily you know almost everybody here.
24310,Leonard,Listen to me Sheldon. I am not going to Lebanon to return Super Mario Brothers the movie.
24311,Sheldon,Oh of course. Wouldn’t want to intrude. This is yours.
24312,Penny,Did I see X-Men?
24313,Raj,Very well.
24314,Sheldon,But I don’t want to know how many underpants you own. Although based on the floor of your bedroom I’d say it’s a thousand.
24315,Leonard,He’s Glissinda the troll.
24316,Penny,It’s okay.
24317,Penny,Okay what do you think?
24318,Leonard,You can if you try. Think about it this way if I were Batman and you were Alfred you’d keep that secret. Right?
24319,Sheldon,Not to mention the impact on our social circle. Everything’s going to change. Howard won’t be able to come over as much.
24320,Howard,Yes it is. Very cool!
24321,Leonard,Yeah of course you do I’m not just a genius in bed. You sure are baby.
24322,Sheldon,Okay here we go. Episode I The Phantom Menace.
24323,Sheldon,Oh wait wait shouldn’t we just eat? You know I mean God did take time out of his busy schedule to bless these Sloppy Joes.
24324,Sheldon,Tell her I’m not here.
24325,Raj,Yeah okay whatever it takes to keep you busy for a few hours.
24326,Sheldon,Exactly the kind of spirit with which Princess Punchali led the monkeys to freedom.
24327,Penny,Okay. Ready set go.
24328,Sheldon,Oh and one last thing. If you find yourself working with a male scientist who’s as smart as me as tall as me and has hair like Thor well then I want you to step away from the situation and call me immediately.
24329,Sheldon,What I’d like is for him to have a more depressing home. This is quite lovely.
24330,Raj,I uh I guess you’re probably wondering what’s got me down.
24331,Howard,Like who?
24332,Leonard,What?
24333,Sheldon,Oh okay let me see this. All right so this particle here is the boson moving forward in time. Now I was thinking… Howard you go ahead and eat. This isn’t going to make any sense to you.
24334,Sheldon,Gentlemen the game offers us a choice between playing for the Republic and the light side or the Sith Empire and the dark side.
24335,Penny,Sheldon this is ridiculous.
24336,Sheldon,Yeah exactly. It’s an MP3 player brought to us by the makers of Xbox.
24337,Penny,You know I’ve done this before. In kindergarten I was supposed to marry Jason Sorensen at recess but by the time my class got out there he was already engaged to Chelsea Himmelfarb. So what did I do? Hung upside down from the monkey bars let all the boys see my underpants.
24338,Leonard,By stalking them?
24339,Sheldon,He gets a new office I can’t even get paper towels in the men’s room?
24340,Penny,Sheldon.
24341,Leonard,I just don’t understand why you invited him here today.
24342,Sheldon,Yes we skyped this morning and I’m sure I’ll check in with her before I go to sleep.
24343,Penny,Yes.
24344,Leonard,Sheldon…
24345,Penny,Okay.
24346,Leonard,Fine if you apologize to everyone they all say it’s okay then yes you can come.
24347,Leonard,I’m packing up all my collectibles and taking them down to the comic book store to sell.
24348,Raj,Okay um okay what if you rig up a pulley system and move yourself across the room in a harness?
24349,Leonard,Well it might not be a great idea to invite those two.
24350,Howard,Hello.
24352,Howard,Well Howard eating that pistachio was like when King Joffrey got poisoned.
24353,Sheldon, Leonard.
24355,Sheldon,While unlikely it’s still a statistical possibility. She might be performing sexual acts with him and not even know it.
24356,Howard,I’d like to back you up but it sounds like it was pretty precious.
24357,Howard,Smart looks like we’re being helpful.
24358,Sheldon,I don’t care it’s demeaning. And I refuse to be trotted out and shown off like a prize hog at the Texas State Fair. Which by the way is something you don’t want to attend wearing a Star Trek ensign’s uniform.
24359,Raj,What’s wrong with you?
24360,Penny,It’s just it’s my pattern. I break up then I find some cute guy and then it’s just thirty six meaningless of… well you know.
24362,Leonard,Yeah they are.
24363,Leonard,So we’ll just order three entrees.
24364,Sheldon,The fun loving and morally loose Miss Maggie McGeary.
24365,Sheldon,Move. Move. Move!
24366,Sheldon,Exactly.
24367,Howard,Aha. I see what’s going on here. You and I had our crazy night together and now you can’t stand to see me with another woman.
24368,Penny,Okay Sheldon you don’t have to do this because Leonard and I are not…
24369,Leonard,Oh look now he’s boring on an international scale.
24370,Penny,No you won’t. Uh can I hide out here for a while.
24371,Penny,And Zack’s engaged. Leonard has no reason to feel threatened.
24372,Penny,Oh that’s hot hot hot hot! Whoo! It really sneaks up on ya huh? All right I gotta go.
24373,Penny,Oh yay!
24374,Raj,I have three words for you. Wrath of Khan.
24375,Leonard,Why not?
24376,Sheldon,Why would she keep something from me you know? I shared my body with that woman. And my Netflix password. They recommended Stella Got Her Groove Back because of her.
24377,Leonard,Sorry. Syrup.
24378,Sheldon,I would throw a quick slant to a wideout given that the defence is showing blitz.
24379,Sheldon,Oh yes I pass out all the time. But it was worth it. I’ve made substantial progress in bonding with Kripke which brings me to an awkward moment.
24380,Raj,Let’s do this.
24381,Raj,Still making sure the telescope’s camera is white-field balanced.
24382,Sheldon,Wolowitz perfect. Everyone listen to Wolowitz.
24383,Penny,Yes.
24384,Howard,See? This is exactly the kind of thing I’m worried about you saying in front of her.
24385,Penny,You are such an ass. This is exactly why I didn’t want to tell you I was taking a class in the first place.
24386,Penny,Okay it may look that way but getting fired from that movie was the best thing that could have happened to me okay? I finally realize I don’t need to be famous or have some big career to be happy.
24387,Sheldon,I’ve made you breakfast. Juice coffee and pancakes in the shape of some of your favorite fictional characters. See here’s Frodo.
24388,Leonard,I swear that man is the most egotistical insufferable human being I have ever met.
24389,Howard,I think over time they started to resent each other and instead of talking about the things that bothered them they kept it bottled up and the hate just grew.
24390,Penny,What you doing? Trying to contact your home planet?
24391,Sheldon,Does it smell like blueberries?
24392,Sheldon,It’s like looking at the universe naked. 
24394,Leonard,Raj help me out here.
24395,Raj,Later losers!
24396,Howard,What do you mean a show?
24397,Raj,No no no I’m fine.
24398,Howard,For your information Emily is working tonight.
24399,Sheldon,Ooh the Green Lantern’s ring could make a big green hand that unscrews it.
24400,Sheldon,Don’t worry. My problems can wait while you two hens finish your clucking.
24401,Leonard,Well the last three nights I’ve had to take him to get a haircut to the train store and to a Walgreens in Arcadia where they still have the good ibuprofen. Now ask me how I’m doing with Amy gone.
24402,Sheldon,I’m trying to get these tables cleared. We’re slammed.
24403,Penny,Yay.
24404,Howard,His only options here are to fake a heart attack or have a real one.
24405,Sheldon,Who’s in the mood to laugh?
24406,Howard,Like I said you ladies have fun.
24407,Sheldon,Oh no thank you I don’t want to be an inconvenience. Chop-chop Leonard. We leave in ten minutes.
24408,Sheldon,If you’re having trouble deciding where to sit may I suggest one potato two potato or as I call it the Leslie Winkle experimental methodology.
24410,Sheldon,With or without a numbing agent?
24411,Sheldon,Yes General Tso.
24412,Leonard,Horse but mostly just for the height. A little bit for the genital girth.
24413,Sheldon,Oh fine I won’t shut my heart to the love of Jennifer Lawrence.
24414,Raj,It’s not just the kite thing. Every time we go some place you think you can just dump me whenever someone prettier comes along even though you don’t have a shot with them.
24415,Sheldon,There problem solved.
24416,Raj,Train day?
24417,Leonard,How did I ruin him?
24418,Leonard,Bye.
24419,Howard,I love it I’ll be all like busted and they’ll be like what? And then we’ll all be like oh yeah. Yeah I get it. I wouldn’t make out with me either.
24420,Howard,Hey.
24421,Leonard,You’re very talented. This is really good. Did you do… 
24422,Penny,Okay well thank you again.
24423,Leonard,Sometimes.
24424,Leonard,Uh rash that’s a bad rash.
24425,Howard,Oh and did they have kids?
24426,Sheldon,It’s going to take more than I’m sorry and a store-bought apology pie from Penny to make up for what you’ve done to me.
24427,Sheldon,Project Gorilla entry two. I am exhausted.
24428,Penny,We’re sorry. What do you need?
24429,Penny,Hey I just wanted to make sure you’re okay.
24430,Sheldon,Oh well.
24431,Leonard,Yeah. I’m excited to finally meet your girlfriend.
24432,Sheldon,Aren’t I?
24433,Sheldon,Oh I don’t know. Theon Greyjoy looks pretty good for a guy who had his genitals cut off.
24434,Sheldon,Well hello to you too.
24435,Penny,Yeah but if I become a successful actress we wouldn’t need the money.
24436,Penny,All right. Pass the soy sauce.
24437,Sheldon,Hello. I’m here for my haircut with Mr. D’Onofrio.
24438,Penny,I can’t believe I’m doing this.
24439,Sheldon,Well word around the university is I’m giving her sex organs a proper jostling.
24440,Sheldon,No misunderstanding. I’ve learned what that request actually means and I don’t want to be joined to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis.
24441,Sheldon,Not finished. It is because of you that I now have a criminal record and it is because of you that I missed out on having gelato with Stan Lee.
24442,Howard,What? No. ..
24444,Penny,But you’re curious about aluminium cans? You’re a weird little guy.
24445,Howard,Hey everybody! The bachelor boy has arrived! For he’s a jolly good fellow…
24446,Sheldon,I’m sorry I can’t imagine any of that.
24447,Sheldon,Oh easy Bill Nye the Science Guy.
24448,Sheldon,See I did all this great work and now he’s just going to come along and ruin it. I am angrier than ever and filled with despair.
24449,Sheldon,…the invitation to join the Arctic Expedition.
24450,Sheldon,You truly are the Goofus to my Gallant.
24451,Leonard,It does. But in my experience you don’t.
24452,Raj,Oh. Did you know at the United Nations there’s a Department for Outer Space Affairs?
24453,Sheldon,To quote Han Solo I know.
24454,Howard,No rush no rush.
24455,Howard,How old is this Jell-O?
24456,Leonard,Sheldon? Hello?
24457,Raj,Gamma.
24458,Leonard,Back in the pocket it goes. Look you do understand that Sheldon really doesn’t care when he gets the money back. It’s actually one of the few idiosyncrasies that doesn’t make you want to you know kill him.
24459,Raj,And it only took 28 minutes.
24460,Sheldon,Well I thought that too but I’ve come to realize I am completely dependent on you.
24461,Leonard,Well… I don’t know what to say.
24462,Leonard,He’ll figure it out when he falls off the roof.
24463,Leonard,What happened?
24464,Leonard,We can help you. We can be your team. Like uh Professor Xavier and his X-Men.
24465,Sheldon,Alright.
24466,Raj,I don’t want to be Aquaman. He sucks. He sucks underwater. He sucks fish pee.
24467,Raj,Dude! I put that thing on my face!
24468,Sheldon,Biology and physics coming together this is like the peanut butter cup of the mind. Oh I know what I want my treat to be.
24469,Sheldon,Uh-oh.
24470,Penny,That is an amazing idea. Okay how many of these have I had?
24471,Leonard,God Sheldon. What the hell are you doing out there?
24472,Leonard,Stay out of this. You and your stupid machine started this fight.
24473,Howard,She and I are both a little awkward in social situations so this seemed like a good idea.
24474,Howard,Course.
24475,Sheldon,I shall. Have a nice scoot.
24476,Sheldon,Is that really what you want to talk about Leonard?
24477,Sheldon,Well it is. If I wanted to hold three things at once I’d wear cargo pants.
24478,Leonard,Oh… uh… no… we don’t live together… um… we live together but in separate heterosexual bedrooms.
24479,Sheldon,Answer honestly. This is not a trial. That’ll come later.
24480,Leonard,Excuse me. You’re a world-renowned expert in parenting and child development and all you’ve got is buck up?
24481,Sheldon,I stand corrected. Fun.
24482,Sheldon,What I need is to get to work.
24483,Raj,Right now well well actually to to be completely honest I’m stopping by to see my ex-girlfriend because she’s having a tough time. But it’s not like we’re getting back together or anything.
24484,Sheldon,Never mind. You know Penny went to this spa to be away from you. Are you sure you should be going there?
24485,Sheldon,Really?
24486,Howard,You have a beautiful voice.
24487,Leonard,Yeah okay. Um Howard we need to talk.
24488,Sheldon,No?
24489,Sheldon,With gift-giving there’s an implied social contract. If I show up tonight with a present and she doesn’t have one for me she’ll feel terrible.
24490,Leonard,All right.
24491,Howard,Well I believe people do their best work when they feel safe and secure.
24492,Sheldon,Excuse me. I have a girlfriend. I’m already king of the train store.
24493,Leonard,The what?
24494,Howard,I’m not too shy and passive. You write her back and tell her I said that. You know when you have a second.
24495,Sheldon,Oh please you don’t even have a PhD.
24496,Leonard,O-o-o-o-oh.
24497,Leonard,So well before making any rash…
24498,Sheldon,Well that’s been my room since before I met Leonard and now someone else is going to be living in it. And that someone else is not me. And you know how I feel about people who aren’t me.
24499,Sheldon,I’d like a ride. Assuming you actually do take me to work.
24500,Howard,Legoland seems like a hollow dream now.
24501,Howard,Okay Sheldon. I’m going to be leading you through a series of meditation exercises. These methods come from the ancient gurus of India and have helped me overcome my own fears.
24502,Penny,Not yet. There it is.
24503,Sheldon,Tell me what?
24504,Penny,He really seems into her.
24505,Penny,No no no no. You’re right. We’re not going out anymore I should pay for myself.  What?
24506,Leonard,Got it. Oh. There. Oh yeah. Yeah now I’m feeling it. Oh this is great. I could do this for the rest of my life. Hey speaking speaking of things you do for the rest of your life uh did I read that you’re on that-that tenure committee?
24507,Howard,I can’t take it dude.
24508,Penny,Wait. No Amy you’re supposed to ask her something personal or embarrassing.
24509,Sheldon,Don’t waste my time.
24510,Sheldon,You know I’ve been wanting to go.
24511,Leonard,Okay I get it.
24512,Sheldon,Well then I hate it. Music should just be fun.
24513,Penny,I know I know.
24514,Sheldon,We don’t know that. Not to a certainty. All we know is that Leonard is home.
24515,Leonard,Great. How come?
24516,Penny,In a safe place.
24517,Howard,Why?
24518,Howard,Of course I do.
24519,Leonard,No but you can have mine.
24520,Leonard,Sure no problem.
24521,Penny,Oh look why is it so hard for you to keep one little secret?
24522,Sheldon,You’re out and you’re out. I win. Who wants pizza?
24523,Leonard,Yes they’re training dogs to operate the centrifuge for when they need dogs to operate the centrifuge for blind scientists I have to go.
24524,Penny,I thought the blowers were more sanitary?
24525,Sheldon,If I could of I would of.
24526,Sheldon,I’m sorry 294?
24527,Sheldon,Yeah well I’m not just some trained monkey dancing for coins.
24530,Sheldon,We really need to skedaddle. Thank you.
24531,Leonard,So how’d it go with Ramona last night?
24532,Sheldon,Me.
24533,Howard,Oh I’m having the nicest time. You guys are like family to me. You know that right?
24534,Sheldon,Well actually that would be all the more reason to you know check your engine.
24535,Penny,You know I remember the first time I got a bikini wax. My sister did it with melted Crayolas and duct tape. It’s a bad idea.
24536,Howard,Okay okay. Although many older women lead vibrant active…
24537,Leonard,I was just going off your comment about the nice guy…
24538,Sheldon,Yeah as the person beneath you allow me to say I know.
24539,Leonard,Next level.
24540,Leonard,That’s not helping.
24541,Leonard,I don’t know. I mean if he’s not nice it’s gonna make it hard for me to watch him in anything again.
24542,Penny,And begin. This is kind of creepy.
24543,Sheldon,Cersei uses her body to manipulate men. Penny just takes me to The LEGO Store.
24544,Leonard,No. No no no no. But if someday you decide you want to get married you have to propose to me.
24545,Howard,Actually there’s no proof of that.
24546,Leonard,Yes.
24547,Penny,Isn’t this when he says bazooka or something?
24548,Leonard,Okay well this might make you feel better. Uh we’re both scared that our marriage will be a disaster and so that’s something that we have in common. Also we both think I’m not funny. Huh? See you’re not laughing.
24549,Leonard,Blue and yellow make green.
24550,Sheldon,It’s three-person chess. Did you bring a friend?
24551,Leonard,It wasn’t it was not you are a nutcase.
24552,Leonard,Well it is their child.
24553,Sheldon,I’m sorry I thought this delay was so you could watch Wheel of Fortune with your mother.
24554,Penny,Okay I’m not innocent in all this but you basically called me stupid you asthmatic dumbass.
24555,Sheldon,Not a chance.
24556,Leonard,I get it. Uh just this morning Sheldon wouldn’t let me put almond milk on my Grape-Nuts because he said it was a theoretical nut conflict.
24557,Penny,Ugh. Can we just have sex?
24558,Penny,Uh well you can try but the people across the hall are being very noisy.
24559,Penny,My baby is sad and I’m gonna make him happy again.
24560,Leonard,Uh Hufflepuff from Harry Potter.
24561,Penny,If it’s such a big deal how come the biggest celebrity they could get for the cover is a molecule?
24562,Raj,I’m not a virgin Sheldon.
24563,Raj,Oh my goodness. Aren’t you the cutest little Yorkie ever? You got him for me?
24564,Leonard,Should we call Howard and Bernadette?
24565,Leonard,People are coming over it looked fun.
24566,Penny,And whenever you’re hungry you’ll be in a minivan with Cheerios all over the floor.
24567,Sheldon,What? But he’s a mediocre academic. And according to Beverley his sexual prowess is sub-par. He’s basically Leonard with a bigger prostate.
24568,Leonard,Come on it wasn’t that bad.
24569,Howard,Stay I’ll get her.
24571,Penny,Leonard said cockamamie?
24572,Raj,What’s this?
24573,Sheldon,Did you pick up the low-sodium soy sauce from the market?
24574,Sheldon,Well I think I have a nice 2009 AnaMantle HC. It’s usually indicated for acutely inflamed haemorrhoids but it also goes nicely with non mucosal body parts.
24575,Raj,Yes. Whenever things are going well I always find a way to ruin it. You two look happy how do you do it?
24576,Raj,I invited you to my murder mystery party.
24577,Raj,Okay let’s see if this drug works.
24578,Penny,Yes I will go out with you.
24581,Howard,I think it shows a lot of character.
24582,Leonard,Just to shoot the couch with a paintball gun?
24583,Penny,Cooper told Amelia about all the strange and incredible things the future would hold like computers and living past 30. He asked her if she had any questions. All she longed to ask was if his heart was beating as fast as hers but she was too afraid to hear the answer.
24584,Sheldon,What’s wrong with your closet?
24585,Leonard,Hold on you’re thinking of going there?
24586,Leonard,Penny kissing me is not insane. She used to kiss me all the time.
24587,Penny,It’s like he’s trying to win a prize. A word of advice don’t doze off. You will never hear the end of it.
24588,Howard,You could play Ping-Pong for it.
24590,Howard,No way. Not Bill Murray.
24591,Howard,That’s for me Ramon Julio Jesus and Rodrigo to know and you to find out.
24592,Leonard,Why do you regret uh never mind stupid question.
24593,Penny,Hey wouldn’t it be funny if after all your years of hard work I’m the one who makes a scientific breakthrough? He doesn’t think that’s funny.
24594,Sheldon,I can’t think of a reason why not.
24595,Penny,Please come out Bernadette. Let’s talk through this.
24596,Penny,Very. Leonard is so great.
24597,Leonard,Yeah we can always divide soup.
24598,Penny,Oh sorry sweetie I can’t help you till I’ve had my coffee.
24599,Sheldon,My hypotheses tend to have that effect.
24600,Sheldon,Moot. Rendered unimportant by recent events.
24601,Leonard,Anything?
24602,Penny,Yeah hang on just give me sec.
24603,Leonard,That actually does help.
24604,Sheldon,I can’t believe my own mother is abandoning me.
24605,Sheldon,Penny we’re in the red zone. The white zone is for loading and unloading. We’re breaking the law.
24606,Howard,Pardon?
24607,Sheldon,On the one hand the Xbox One has a better camera but the PS4 has a removable hard drive. Thoughts?
24608,Sheldon,Well I would have been here sooner but for some reason your home isn’t on this map of Hollywood stars.
24609,Raj,Now we are done.
24611,Penny,Oh are you here to see Leonard?
24612,Leonard,Hey.
24613,Leonard,Harry and Ginny get together?
24614,Raj,You’ll be happy I did. Okay little one here we are back at home because you weren’t quite ready to come out yet. You wanted to make an entrance. I get it. And here’s your daddy. When he tries to tell you he used to be cool you can see he wasn’t.
24615,Leonard,How do I have Penny? In what universe do I have Penny?
24616,Sheldon,It’s a laptop with a full charge. Honestly what do you see in him?
24617,Penny,Well Leonard used to do all these things like bring me flowers and wear pants.
24618,Sheldon,The online description was completely misleading they said eight slots plus removable ID to any rational person that would mean room for nine cards but they don’t tell you the removable ID takes up one slot it’s a nightmare.
24619,Penny,Sure.
24620,Sheldon,Well she talks a lot. She always wants to hold hands.
24621,Sheldon,Now try to increase your alpha-wave activity.
24622,Howard,Oh congratulations. You’re the first team to arrive.
24623,Leonard,Howard come on I didn’t plan on this. These things just happen. Usually not to me but they do happen.
24624,Sheldon,How could I not?
24625,Howard,Let’s go to the biology lab and find you some nice yummy mice.
24626,Penny,What do you want me to do?
24627,Leonard,I can’t believe I shaved my stomach for this.
24628,Sheldon,Well Amy enjoys knitting her own sweaters so I was thinking of getting her an all-expense-paid trip to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival.
24629,Leonard,High-energy lasers.
24630,Raj,Now take a sip swirl it around your mouth and try to notice the flavours the tannins the textures. Well?
24631,Penny,Come on don’t be like that. We had so much fun together the last couple of months.
24632,Penny,I can’t believe you’re seeing someone and we don’t even know about it.
24633,Leonard,Don’t worry. You’ll meet a girl someday.
24634,Penny,Actually that’s not true Leonard. In fact recently I’ve been thinking that given the parameters of your experiment the transport of electrons through the aperture the nano-fabricated metal rings is qualitatively no different than the experiment already conducted in the Netherlands. Their observed phase shift in the diffusing electrons inside the metal ring already conclusively demonstrated the electric analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum-interference effect. That’s it. That’s all I know. Oh wait! Fig Newtons were named after a town in Massachusetts not the scientist.
24635,Howard,When stuff like this gets me down you know what I like to do?
24636,Sheldon,I can just picture them all right now at Feynman’s house probably discussing Schrodinger and at the same time not discussing Schrodinger. See? They’re missing out on hilarious jokes like that.
24637,Leonard,At least it’s quiet when he takes bathroom breaks.
24638,Howard,Okay uh how about her?
24639,Howard,Don’t worry Jerry won’t be fooled by that type of behaviour.
24640,Leonard,Good to see you Mother.
24641,Sheldon,Morning.
24642,Howard,You know what? I think it’s a little weird that you remember me saying all these things. Maybe the truth is you’re jealous of all my relationships.
24643,Leonard,Uh well we didn’t actually get Chinese food.
24644,Sheldon,Of course not. I’ll have my usual.
24645,Leonard,You sure?
24646,Sheldon,I was talking about Leonard. And if make up is so truthful why is it called concealer?
24647,Howard,Did Bernadette think it was cool?
24648,Sheldon,Coins lodged in body parts is not a source of amusement. When I was five Billy Sparks put a Mexican peso up my nose.
24649,Sheldon,How is it sexist? My character wields a battle axe as well as any man.
24650,Sheldon,I have not ruled it out.
24651,Sheldon,Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Oh God not Euclid Avenue! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
24652,Penny,Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.
24653,Penny,Come on it’ll be fun and you know your mom was genuinely hurt we didn’t invite her to the first one.
24654,Penny,Shut up. I solved it.
24655,Leonard,No it’s more of a relentless narcissistic drone.
24656,Leonard,Mmm in all fairness Pictionary has verbal skills visual skills. It’s a pretty well-rounded game.
24658,Leonard,I don’t know. Tell her I’m sick.
24659,Leonard,Um I’m okay with you driving my car. I’m not okay with you flying my car.
24660,Raj,As long as we’re apologising Sheldon I I’m sorry I used your toothbrush.
24661,Raj,She won’t notice they’re missing?
24662,Leonard,I assume by never again you mean never again will you drink all of Penny’s beer then run down to the gas station for a couple of 40s a box of Slim Jims and the latest issue of Bombay Badonkadonks.
24663,Leonard,Raj?
24664,Raj,No no no that would be crazy. I mean if I were hitting on you you’d know it ’cause you’d feel uncomfortable and a little sad for me.
24665,Leonard,I would love that.
24666,Penny,Absolutely not. Help me out here I can’t afford another demerit.
24667,Penny,We never got to the bedroom.
24668,Sheldon,Ah yes well that may be the proximal cause of our journey but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause.
24669,Sheldon,I’m a teacher Leonard. It’s my job.
24670,Sheldon,Oh!
24671,Penny,You want me to stop reading?
24672,Sheldon,First of all you’re welcome. And furthermore not being familiar with Wil Wheaton’s body of work there was no way for you to know you were being rude to a national treasure. Get ready for 130 hours of I told you so.  She’s hooked.
24673,Sheldon,The next clue must be hidden under one of these rocks.
24675,Raj,That sounds like a yes.
24676,Leonard,Eh I’m worth it.
24677,Raj,Hell Hounds. Who let the Satanic dogs out? Who? Who-who?
24678,Raj,See? Better with the accent.
24679,Sheldon,This video. The baby panda sneezes and the mama panda gets so scared.
24680,Penny,What and you think I want to see a documentary about aluminium can recycling?
24681,Penny,Sheldon do you want to sleep here tonight?
24682,Leonard,I’ll be right back.
24683,Raj,Hey dude you’re killing me with Claire.
24684,Leonard,Okay let’s see.
24685,Penny,Okay so basically you’re the reason I have to walk up and down three flights of stairs every day?
24686,Sheldon,Now I know how the African slaves felt. Being dragged from their homes to labour under the yoke of the white man.
24687,Leonard,Hey you guys want to go on a real live quest?
24688,Sheldon,Well stick to your guns. There will be a lot of pressure.
24689,Howard,Oh well I was going to spend the night with my special little lady but uh she got worms and then I had to take her to the vet.
24690,Raj,Okay just to be clear roller skating was my idea and I’m very unhappy that you turned it into a double date and I hope you both fall on your asses and break your coccyxes.
24691,Howard,Of course you feel terrible. You completely screwed up your karma dude.
24692,Leonard,Just eat Sheldon you’ll feel better.
24693,Leonard,We are so smart.
24694,Penny,And I really appreciate it but now I don’t need it so here you go.
24695,Sheldon,I’m afraid I can’t allow that. Pursuant to Starfleet General Order 104 Section A you are deemed unfit and I hereby relieve you of your command.
24696,Sheldon,Technically Howard’s the gear head. Leonard’s just a dime store laser jockey.
24697,Sheldon,– Because it’s almost eleven o’clock.
24698,Leonard,Beats me. They were playing all last night too.
24700,Sheldon,Hit troll with axe. Hit troll with axe. Hit troll with axe. Oh my this is one tough troll.
24701,Leonard,Well I’m gonna go put on some pants just in case. But I have to say this is very freeing.
24702,Sheldon,I can’t talk right now I have several thousand updates to install.
24703,Raj,A hog? You have a two cylinder scooter with a basket on the front.
24704,Sheldon,Oh quite all right. After my forehead melanoma scare I’ve learned not to sweat the small stuff. Well sorry I don’t have all the ingredients to make chai tea.
24705,Penny,I guess it wouldn’t hurt to meet some fans and make a little extra money.
24706,Sheldon,Hey that’s my shirt.
24707,Sheldon,Thank you fellow Bozite. And may I say you are the living embodiment of all the promises made by our lovely town’s Chamber of Commerce.  One ticket to Pasadena California please.
24708,Howard,Maybe you don’t want someone exactly like you. You know what they say opposites attract.
24709,Raj,I like it I like it. Did they smell good despite their gothlike nature?
24710,Sheldon,That’s it. Prepare to be minimized.
24711,Penny,You don’t have a problem with this do you?
24712,Sheldon,Now I’ve learned some fun facts about New Jersey to help you make small talk. Would you like to know the state bird or the murder rate? They’re both shocking.
24713,Leonard,Have you ever seen them?
24714,Raj,I didn’t get a lot of that because of your accent but the general tone was soothing and somehow I feel better.
24715,Leonard,We got an e-mail from the East Rutherford New Jersey Gay Lesbian Bisexual and Transgender Alliance. They want another thousand Penny Blossoms.
24716,Sheldon,I bet that started off as a joke but by the third one you realized there was something strangely enjoyable about it.
24717,Raj,Sorry. Sorry.
24718,Penny,He’s a musician. He’ll sleep in his own vomit if he has to.
24719,Leonard,I’m just making a point.
24720,Raj,It’s true you’re both gorgeous. Kind of says something about the man who could bed you both. You get why I’ve been alone most of my adult life.
24721,Sheldon,Thank you Penny.
24722,Penny,You know I gotta go home and wash my hair.
24723,Howard,What?
24724,Leonard,It’s 7 a.m. I’m sorry it’s early but we’re leaving soon and I needed to talk to you.
24725,Sheldon,I suppose. Battlestar Galactica comes on tonight.  And then never ever watch it.
24726,Penny,Okay how about this. You keep him there a little longer and when you get to the party I’ll point out which of my friends are easy.
24727,Howard,I’ve missed you.
24728,Sheldon,Not with commentary.
24729,Leonard,Where are your snipers?
24730,Sheldon,I told you walking.
24731,Penny,Our pleasure.
24732,Raj,Not that one.
24733,Penny,Ha. Well that’s what I am queen of the nerds.
24734,Raj,What do you mean a show?
24735,Howard,Sheldon I think you might find the support you’re looking for if you realize that relationships are a give and take. She can only be there for you as much as you are for her.
24736,Howard,What difference does it make?
24737,Leonard,What should we do?
24738,Howard,Hey Leonard?
24739,Raj,Do you think they gave Wolverine an Adamantium prostate?
24740,Penny,Hey how are we doing over here? Can I get you something to drink?
24741,Leonard,You’re kidding.
24742,Sheldon,Penny?
24743,Leonard,No.
24744,Leonard,You know what? Why don’t we just ease into this. Let let’s go for a walk and and and see if we find a new restaurant.
24745,Raj,What is she doing in a comic book store?
24746,Sheldon,Hungry? Tired? I’m sorry this really isn’t my strong suit.
24747,Penny,Wow that’s all you got after you were the most obnoxious person on a double date that included Howard Wolowitz?
24748,Leonard,All right. Uh what’s new with you?
24749,Howard,What the hell is that?
24750,Howard,I’ll pull the van up.
24751,Sheldon,Clowder.
24752,Leonard,It’s classified. If we tell anyone we’d get in trouble.
24753,Leonard,Excuse me but what about me? Why don’t I get a shot?
24754,Sheldon,No. I’m not sure how we’re going to get past this.
24755,Sheldon,Well we gave it a shot. How about you?
24756,Raj,That’s rough.
24757,Howard,If you could feel how soft my skin is you wouldn’t have to ask.
24758,Sheldon, Penny.
24759,Leonard,Good night.
24760,Raj,Would you like me to help? I do have a certain je ne sais quois when it comes to soirees.
24761,Sheldon,You all have clearly put in a lot of hard work.
24762,Penny,Come on just open it.
24763,Leonard,How can I go out with a woman who believes in psychics?
24764,Penny,Come on Amy. That is not gonna work.
24765,Howard,Well didn’t think this is where my life would be.
24766,Sheldon,No problem I’ll just do my laundry another night.
24767,Penny,You want the fruit platter?
24768,Raj,I didn’t know you were coming again.
24769,Leonard,Good good. You?
24770,Sheldon,No.
24771,Howard,And nobody drew a penis on his forehead.
24772,Howard,Yeah. Well if you want to march in a fishnet crop top you better lay off that dip.
24773,Leonard,Oh no no. That’s Clarence Darrow. It’s from a game Sheldon made up called Chutes and Lawyers. You slide down a chute and then work your way back up through the appellate system.
24774,Raj,I got my new bloodthirsty savage warrior who will lay waste to all who stand before him. And I had a sensible salad for lunch so I can eat all the pizza I want.
24775,Penny,Is he still wearing the Batman suit under the Man-Bat suit?
24776,Leonard,I do of course I do.
24777,Penny,You walked out of the house in a fez and bow tie. I went so you didn’t get beat up.
24778,Leonard,He’s not going to have intercourse with Penny.
24779,Howard,Ask rhetorical questions that make people uncomfortable?
24780,Sheldon,Yeah.
24781,Leonard,Use your best judgement.
24782,Raj,If this was Star Trek we could use a phaser to blast it off.
24783,Sheldon,That is amazing. He made me care about the ogre.
24784,Sheldon,Hello.
24785,Leonard,I’m sorry?
24786,Sheldon,In the year 2000 Pope John Paul II was named an honorary Harlem Globetrotter.
24787,Leonard,Sorry let me help you.
24788,Penny,Why not?
24789,Leonard,What?
24790,Leonard,No no! No-no-no! The screen froze. It’s probably just buffering just give it a second.
24791,Raj,Sounds fun.
24792,Leonard,It’s perfect.
24793,Penny,To be cool? Yeah.
24794,Leonard,What makes you think I didn’t go to my prom? I went.
24795,Leonard,What do you want Sheldon?
24796,Sheldon,Well I’m not proud of it but I jaywalked.
24797,Leonard,If I could calm down I wouldn’t be having a panic attack that’s why they call it a panic attack.
24798,Penny,Yeah.
24799,Sheldon,You don’t remember me? How could he not remember me?
24800,Leonard,No. He can’t afford his apartment and he’s asking if anyone knows of a cheap place to live. I want to say India but it seems mean.
24801,Raj,Look I’m a lonely guy I watch a lot of movies. Look Penny if you truly want to be romantic it needs to come from you.
24802,Penny,Here we go again. Why is everyone so concerned with us setting a date? We’re committed to each other. We’re happy. A ceremony isn’t gonna change anything.
24803,Sheldon,Congratulations? The Newcomb medal? Oh please. That’s the scientific equivalent of a smiley face sticker on your homework.
24804,Leonard,Okay bug report taken. Next time I will have a better plan for our evening’s activity.
24805,Leonard,Lesley and I do research together at the University.
24806,Howard,Why should I back off you back off dude.
24807,Raj,That would be amazing.
24808,Howard,Would you stop writing? Wait so did all of you go on to better relationships after me?
24809,Leonard,So nothing let’s destroy him.
24810,Sheldon,Good night puny human! .
24811,Howard,Do you know if you look at Austria on a map it actually looks like a wiener?
24812,Sheldon,Why not?
24813,Penny,Oh. Oh okay well you know like I said I have plans so.
24814,Leonard,Not this time.
24815,Sheldon,Uh building on that we should order dinner.
24816,Raj,Okay the final image is coming in. And the object we discovered is…
24817,Raj,What else do we know about him?
24818,Howard,We’re good.
24819,Leonard,Get up we can’t lose at math.
24820,Raj,Oh please sit. I tried to cook you a meal from your homeland.
24821,Penny,Good morning slut.
24822,Leonard,I’d enjoy that.
24823,Sheldon,What does that stand for?
24824,Leonard,Oh yeah. You know you don’t have to stay for the whole thing.
24825,Raj,It means doo-doo.
24826,Sheldon,You know if you’d like I could call your landlord and complain.
24827,Sheldon,Oh Lord this couldn’t be any more humiliating.
24828,Raj,I’m so mad at you!
24829,Sheldon,Three tines is not a fork three tines is a trident. Forks are for eating tridents are for ruling the seven seas.
24830,Raj,The Wolowitz Coefficient?
24831,Penny,What was it called “I hate my son and that’s why he can’t have cake?”
24833,Leonard,Yes I’ve always admired that about you.
24834,Sheldon,My father loved football. He always made me watch it before I was allowed to do my homework.
24835,Raj,You know we’re not that far from my apartment. If you stop the car I can walk from here.
24836,Sheldon,Get him out Leonard.
24837,Raj,Oh we’re scientists.
24838,Penny,Oh my God! Sheldon and Amy.
24839,Sheldon,Well of course you are. Who else would you take?
24840,Howard,Three.
24841,Leonard,Found the backup inhaler want to have sex?
24842,Sheldon,How can you say that? The scientific opportunity of a lifetime presents itself and my best friend says don’t go.
24843,Penny,Oh! You’re kidding.
24844,Sheldon,To the planetarium.
24845,Leonard,Sure. The more the merrier.
24846,Leonard,Oh. You think he’s your first autograph?
24847,Sheldon,Why would she do this to me?
24848,Leonard,Hugh who?
24849,Leonard,Yeah. What did they say?
24850,Penny,Uh have you thought this through?
24851,Sheldon,Leonard wait. This is highly unethical.
24852,Leonard,What did I just…. Uh we’re here to pick up Penny’s TV.
24853,Leonard,Really?
24854,Sheldon,You’re going up Euclid Avenue?
24855,Sheldon,Are you saying that because the things are unspeakable?
24856,Leonard,Wow Raj you were not lying about her.
24857,Leonard,Great you’re not only more successful than me now you’re more mature.
24858,Penny,Morning.
24859,Sheldon,No it’s not going to be fine change is never fine. They say it is but it’s not.
24860,Leonard,I can’t believe you saved all this stuff.
24861,Penny,Yeah well sadly I do.
24862,Sheldon,I don’t recommend it. You’ll be doing it the rest of your life. Anyway if you’re looking for Leonard he’s with Koothrappali.
24863,Sheldon,Leonard I’m trapped in quicksand the axe is dragging me down.
24864,Sheldon,You remember my mother.
24865,Leonard,Are you gonna laugh at the answer?
24866,Penny,Yeah we could’ve waited till Monday signed the papers this all would have been over.
24867,Sheldon,Twelve hundred dollars. That’s my final offer.
24868,Penny,I know I got it. Sheldon I’m sorry.
24869,Penny,Yeah well a circumstance can happen twice and still be special.
24870,Howard,Hello Hawaii. This is Dr. Koothrappali in Pasadena. I’d like you to reposition the telescope please. Scarlett Johansson’s house! I’m kidding Hawaii. Mahalo. Whoo!
24871,Sheldon,In Leonard? Oh even the Sparkletts guy could see that’s unlikely.
24872,Leonard,How’d it go with my mother?
24873,Penny,Hey.
24875,Raj,What if she wasn’t kidding?
24876,Penny,Yeah you’re out of line.
24877,Howard,Is there anything you’re both equally bad at?
24878,Penny,Oh um you know I think I have the dinner shift on Friday.
24879,Howard,She’s scary but it’s a cute scary.
24880,Leonard,Yes but it’s okay. Now that we know what the problem is there’s a simple solution. 
24881,Leonard,You’re right you should go.
24882,Sheldon,I have to admit leaving you to move in with Amy has been harder than I thought it would be.
24883,Leonard,Oh. Wait then what is it if you just have hair up here?
24884,Leonard,Hey.
24885,Leonard,What the hell is going on?
24886,Penny,I know. It just…
24887,Leonard,W-w-wuh no no hang onuh uh roommate agreement. No hootenannies sing-a-longs or barbershop quartets after ten p.m.
24888,Raj,Everything okay?
24889,Sheldon,Excuse me I believe Aquaman uses his telepathic powers to request the fish do their business elsewhere.
24890,Raj,Why?
24891,Leonard,Say what?
24892,Howard,Name one.
24893,Leonard,Hello.
24894,Penny,Well why the hell did I memorize the Pledge?
24895,Leonard,Did you make it clear that it’s two different train cars turned into hot dog stands?
24896,Penny,God what am I doing with my life?
24897,Leonard,I’m not going you can’t make me.
24898,Leonard,Tough break. You want eggs?
24900,Sheldon,Because despite his fame and fortune he strikes me as a lonely man.
24901,Howard,Oh uh come in come in. Oh I uh I didn’t think I was going to get to see you until tomorrow.
24902,Penny,You think about dying?
24903,Sheldon,Understandable. Your entire life seems to be crumbling around you and your future appears bleak at best.
24904,Sheldon,Yes. In fact he was quite enthusiastic. He said “Frankly if I could send you tonight I would.”
24905,Sheldon,Amy’s changed. I might have to let her go.
24906,Penny,No. Come on let’s talk about our lives. Tell me something about you I don’t know.
24907,Leonard,Here we go.
24909,Raj,So Missy. Have you ever met a man from the exotic subcontinent of India?
24910,Sheldon,Thank you.
24912,Leonard,And the rest of us have had our budgets cut to the bone.
24913,Leonard,You don’t even like Yorkshire pudding.
24914,Leonard,I play a lot of Grand Theft Auto. I think I know how to handle a gat.
24915,Penny,Well ever since she helped me get this job she won’t stop bugging me.
24916,Howard,No.
24917,Leonard,Okay now shift into drive pull out slowly into traffic.
24918,Sheldon,But it’s Friday. Friday’s always vintage game night. Look mom included the memory card we can pick up where I left off in 1999 when I had pernicious anaemia.
24919,Leonard,Yes.
24920,Leonard,You’re lucky I didn’t run you over.
24921,Penny,Deal.
24922,Sheldon,All right then. Good night.
24923,Sheldon,Isn’t it a little late for coffee?
24924,Penny,Is everything okay?
24925,Leonard,I don’t know he was pretty badass on Heroes.
24926,Leonard,Mm butt print. There’s no discernible butt print.
24927,Penny,Okay here.
24929,Penny,Hey I know let’s take Sheldon dancing.
24930,Howard,Not as fun as the night we blew up grapes in the microwave. We really have led full lives.
24931,Leonard,No. Maybe to her.
24932,Leonard,Sorry. I’m moving a little slow. I think I bruised my coccyx.
24933,Leonard,I haven’t heard from Sheldon in a while. You think he’s okay?
24934,Leonard,To my bones. I mean I’m not gonna do anything about it. I love Penny. It’s just nice to have a young attractive woman sniffing around the goods.
24935,Sheldon,Oh well this would be one of those circumstances that people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence.
24936,Leonard,Way to hit ’em with both barrels.
24937,Penny,He’s in trouble with his girlfriend and needs to buy her a present.
24938,Sheldon,Actually I’d say she’s a poor man’s Madhuri Dixit.
24939,Leonard,Hey guys.
24940,Sheldon,My sympathies. I am no stranger to the crimson scourge that is dermatitis. Can I interest you in a topical steroid from my lotion and unguent collection?
24941,Sheldon,For me.
24942,Penny,Wow you really struck a nerve. I’ve never heard him use the M word before.
24943,Penny,Okay. Well I went to this psychic who told me that if I cut my hair I’m going to get a national commercial.
24944,Raj,The big-boobed weather girl on Channel 2?
24945,Sheldon,Why on Earth would we have sex?
24946,Penny,Thank you. Now behave yourself and eat your dinner. Maybe later if you’re lucky you get to sleep with a college girl.
24948,Leonard,Why don’t we just talk?
24949,Penny,Really? That’s it? Well that doesn’t sound so complicated.
24950,Leonard,Is it possible he said Bros before Hos?
24951,Leonard,Really?
24952,Howard,But I need to earn enough money so I can go to Comic-Con.
24953,Sheldon,Oh never have I ever drunk milk past its expiration date.
24954,Penny,Um no.
24955,Howard,Sixty years. Used to be a watch factory.
24956,Sheldon,Tandoori Palace?
24957,Penny,What? I’m not going to apologize to that nutcase.
24958,Penny,You know it’s none of my business but isn’t a guy who can’t speak in front of women going to hold you back a little?
24959,Raj,Well he could bring the baby here.
24960,Sheldon,I’m confused. If there’s no costume parade what are we doing here?
24961,Penny,Okay I give up can we just do something else?
24962,Howard,I don’t think my character should be in a place like this. Everyone’s undressing her with their eyes.
24963,Leonard,It’s too small and too perfect.
24964,Howard,Oh so kind of like what’s happening with Penny right now.
24965,Raj,What do you mean?
24966,Sheldon,I missed a number of date nights while I was on my train trip and I’m contractually obligated to make them up under the terms of the Relationship Agreement.
24967,Leonard,Yes.
24968,Leonard,Fine.
24969,Penny,You know being in a relationship with Leonard also comes with its challenges.
24970,Howard,All right I will.
24971,Leonard,Oh no come on!
24972,Penny,Okay look if I agree to go out with you guys will you promise to stop pestering me about Leonard and Priya?
24973,Howard,Why?
24974,Raj,By moving on do you mean she’s going out with other men and you spent the afternoon making fifteenth century soap with Wolowitz?
24975,Leonard,Wow. That that was crazier than I thought.
24976,Leonard,Well forget it. I was the one who was invited I get to decide who goes with me and it’s Penny not you!
24977,Leonard,What are you doing?
24978,Leonard,What do you mean?
24979,Penny,So that’s it? We’re not going?
24980,Raj,Come on dude you’re being too hard on yourself. You’ve got a lot of good stuff going on.
24981,Leonard,Did we really need to be here for this?
24982,Howard,Where are your tools?
24983,Sheldon,My apologies. I’ve been living with your son too long. Gotten into some bad habits.
24984,Raj,Well this is not for me this is for the baby. Some day she’s gonna want to see this.
24985,Sheldon,Yeah but what happens when we each get a peek behind the curtain? I mean she’s never even seen me unshaven.
24986,Penny,Yeah. Sheldon can I ask you a question?
24987,Penny,I’ll just go look for it.
24988,Sheldon,Get together tonight? Leonard stop trying to control everything and give poor Raj a chance to come up with what we should do. Go ahead Raj.
24989,Leonard,Sheldon I don’t care if you get scalped tickets with us or not but please don’t be creepy and go stalking this poor guy. You’re gonna get in trouble.
24990,Sheldon,Yeah okay I can see you’re going to take this the wrong way. Let me try again. Imagine you’re the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but chimps.
24992,Sheldon,So this conversation is as pointless as your door-knocking soliloquy?
24993,Sheldon,If you’d like to take your mind off what’s troubling you uh word on the street is a bobcat has been spotted.
24994,Leonard,Mm if it makes you feel better you still dress like a child.
24995,Leonard,What are you grinding about?
24996,Howard,Okay okay guys new back stories. Uh Penny and Leonard you two lovebirds are super successful and living in New York. Uh you’re an actress you’re a professor and you have three beautiful kids.
24997,Howard,Sixty seconds. This is not looking good.
24998,Sheldon,Excuse me but a grand unified theory insofar as it explains everything will ipso facto explain neurobiology.
24999,Penny,Mm-hmm.
25000,Penny,All right got it. Is there anything else?
25001,Howard,Hey.
25002,Leonard,I’m also really happy but I can’t pretend it’s for you. New Star Wars in three days.
25003,Leonard,Gonna be a long night.
25004,Leonard,According to the world’s worst cuckoo clock it’s two.
25005,Howard,Yeah me too.
25006,Leonard,Dr Gablehauser.
25007,Penny,Actually you know what? Can we do one more? I think I could do it better.
25008,Leonard,I usually don’t like lemon bars but these these are really good.
25009,Leonard,Hey you guys are talking again. Good. What happened?
25010,Penny,Well why is he turning here? The restaurant’s the other way.
25011,Raj,I’d rather have Fishbine’s it’s bigger.
25012,Penny,What you? Really?
25013,Sheldon,Well I’m not looking forward to it but it is a wonderful opportunity and you need to take it. Besides Princeton is in New Jersey so it’s not like you’re gonna want to stay. Uh I know it’s not your birthday but if you’re interested…
25014,Sheldon,I’m simplifying the task of packing for our trip. See by attaching RFID tags to my clothing it will enable my laptop to read and identify the items with this wand. I will then cross-reference them against destination anticipated activity spectrum weather conditions duration of trip et cetera.
25015,Howard,Uh well I was dating a woman at the university but we broke up.
25016,Sheldon,In what world is a four-four-six-four a four-ten-four?
25017,Leonard,None at all?
25019,Howard,Can we get another bottle of champagne for the table? Don’t worry. It’s my treat.
25020,Leonard,How come you didn’t tell me that you and Father were getting a divorce? How come you didn’t tell me you had surgery? How come you didn’t tell me my dog died?
25021,Leonard,No you don’t. No he doesn’t.
25022,Howard,Paul.
25023,Raj,Oh of course not. She was just sniffing around your goods because she was hunting for truffles.
25024,Leonard,Is it about the rotational symmetries you should be figuring out or your fake caffeine problem?
25025,Penny,Well then why are you going?
25026,Sheldon,To what end?
25027,Leonard,Hey buddy. How you doing?
25028,Raj,You know there is a way we can get action figures to look exactly like us.
25029,Sheldon,Mm.
25030,Penny,Hey Leonard is your wi-fi down? I can’t get on.
25031,Penny,I don’t think he’ll be making that mistake again.
25032,Howard,No it’s not. I’ve always thought that was unfair.
25033,Raj,This is my friend Bernadette. She’s pregnant and she’s a bit worried so I thought maybe you could talk to her.
25034,Penny,Hey you.
25035,Sheldon,Hi.
25036,Leonard,Here?
25037,Leonard,Me too. And he was able to take a sabbatical from…
25038,Penny,It stung Amelia when he spoke to her this way. In her little one-room schoolhouse she was always the smartest student regularly besting the boys in her class but this was no boy in front of her this was a man.
25039,Sheldon,That’s a peculiar conclusion. By any standard Amy is more similar to me than anyone I’ve ever met.
25040,Penny,Well someone had to say it.  What?
25041,Leonard,Yeah but to make him leave not to make him stay.
25042,Leonard,Yeah we watched it last week. You said you liked it.
25043,Sheldon,Is it any wonder he doesn’t have a doctorate?
25044,Penny,Well it just wasn’t the right time.
25045,Howard,I’ve uh created some other user accounts so I can post positive comments about their paper.
25046,Sheldon,I am a scientist. I never apologize for the truth.
25047,Leonard,Because you’re impossible to work with.
25048,Leonard,Okay he’s in the bathroom let’s go.
25049,Howard,Fair enough. Now what’s up with Clarinet? Bernadette!
25050,Penny,Oh really? Well good for him.
25051,Leonard,Terrific it’s just that I don’t think Penny wants me to go.
25052,Penny, Trust me we are not a couple.
25053,Sheldon,Oh alright this is my desk these are my books this is my door please close it behind you. Goodbye.
25054,Sheldon,Yeah there’s hooks in the closet I can hang it right now.
25055,Sheldon,Oh. I hadn’t considered that. I suppose she will have to have access to our progeny. And you don’t think I can achieve the required intimacy via text messaging?
25056,Raj,I was wrong. This is worse.
25057,Sheldon,I do. It fails as drama science fiction and it’s hopelessly derivative. But you like it and you’re my friend.
25058,Leonard,That’s not what it is.
25059,Penny,Zack was a perfectly nice guy and then you ruined him!
25060,Raj,I keep telling you if I wasn’t an astrophysicist I would have been a party planner. It was always a coin flip.
25061,Sheldon,And it’s not a cartoon it’s anime.
25062,Penny,Well can we get on another airline?
25063,Leonard,I’m sorry things turned out this way.
25064,Sheldon,You know people are quick to accuse me of being difficult to live with but the truth is Amy is just as challenging.
25065,Leonard,We all have other costumes we can change.
25067,Penny,What’s wrong?
25068,Howard,Great. Now how are you going to settle it hmm? There is no way to determine the species of the cricket without examining it.
25069,Sheldon,When is the last time I asked you to do something that wasn’t a medical emergency?
25070,Howard,Me too. I’m just I’m a little on edge.
25071,Penny,So was the fight really bad?
25072,Howard,Are you Spock?
25073,Leonard,Good for you Howard. I’m proud of you. And still you’re the first one of us to get married. We have to do something special.
25074,Sheldon,Is that the prototype drive system for the high-G rover?
25075,Penny,Well you don’t like it?
25076,Leonard,Hey Raj I read a couple of guys in your department may have discovered a new planet in our solar system?
25077,Sheldon,Uh-huh. Interesting. Okay.
25078,Sheldon,Exactly. It’s like asking the Human Torch to heat up your frozen burrito.
25079,Penny,Well come on he’s a grown man in his 30s pretending to be a grown man in his 20s. He’s fine.
25080,Leonard,Oh a blanket.
25081,Penny,Honey honey honey let me stop you. That is is not a funny story.
25082,Penny,Oh my God I can’t believe it.
25083,Penny,Oh.
25084,Raj,Of course but it’s all Indian food. You can’t find a bagel in Mumbai to save your life. Schmear me.
25085,Penny,Well I don’t think it’s the kind of part that’s good for my career.
25086,Sheldon,Actually I can’t. Before Leonard left he made me promise that I’d take care of you.
25087,Sheldon,Well we had dinner uh played some games and then I spent the night. Oh you’ll be happy to know that I now have a much better understanding of friends with benefits.
25088,Leonard,You’re surprised? Your psychic didn’t tell you I was going to be a jerk?
25089,Sheldon,No it’s not good enough. It has to be perfect.
25090,Sheldon,That’s all. I’ve just been thinking about it. Now I’m thinking about fractal equations. Now I’m thinking about the origin of the phrase train of thought. Now I’m thinking about trains.
25091,Howard,Okay so Saturday night can I count on my posse?
25092,Leonard,Really?
25093,Penny,Hey. Isn’t tomorrow your usual laundry night?
25094,Leonard,Why are you saying we have marital problems? We don’t have marital problems.
25095,Penny,No come on. You are not going anywhere all right? I am here for you and we are gonna fix this together.
25096,Sheldon,Five minutes? We must be doing it wrong. It took us hours.
25097,Raj,If I don’t have to boom-boom.
25098,Leonard,Yes.
25099,Howard,You should send that to Jimmy Fallon.
25100,Penny,That’s fine. You know I hate that your sister and her friends used to torture you. But what I hate even more is if I was there I would have tortured you too.
25101,Raj,Well then I should tell you I broke the wheel and the handle. So is everyone from Bernadette’s company going to Vegas?
25102,Sheldon, Leonard and Penny.
25103,Howard,No no no the sixth season is great. We go to Paris with Carrie and get our heart broken and then Mr. Big shows up we don’t know if we can trust him again. It’s a wild ride.
25104,Howard,What’s wrong with me Penny?
25105,Sheldon,For me. You’re going to have to listen more carefully when you’re on the job.
25106,Sheldon,Why don’t you show me yours first.
25107,Sheldon,When he finished he shouted Eureka!
25108,Penny,You know I gotta tell you I think you got a real winner with Priya.
25109,Sheldon,No.
25110,Sheldon,Excuse me. No one does a better job pretending to be a person than I do. Siri comes close but I know more jokes.
25111,Howard,I don’t want to go back to India. It’s hot and loud and there’s so many people. You have no idea they’re everywhere.
25112,Howard,Maybe I can save her.
25113,Penny,Well I do.
25114,Sheldon,You health nuts kill me.
25115,Leonard,Well how do I carry it if I’m on my hands and knees?
25116,Leonard,I proposed twice you proposed once. Two to one.
25117,Penny,I’ll talk to Leonard.
25118,Leonard,Nobody wants that.
25119,Leonard,They’re Collectables.
25120,Howard,Twice a month.
25121,Leonard,What’s going on?
25122,Leonard,Really?
25123,Sheldon,Now there’s no need to get defensive. I’m not unsympathetic to your plight. My father used to say that a woman is like an egg salad sandwich on a warm Texas day.
25124,Raj,Hello? What do you mean you found my dog? She’s with my friends. Is she okay? Oh thank you. Uh just text me your address I’m on my way. Oh and if she’s hungry go ahead and feed her. But do not give her anything starchy. She’s having risotto for dinner.
25125,Raj,Because when I use my regular voice I feel like I’m making fun of them.
25126,Penny,Who’s that?
25127,Howard,Why?
25128,Sheldon,I think you’re just making that up.
25129,Penny,He’s still mad at Leonard huh?
25130,Sheldon,Ask me why.
25131,Leonard,Okay.
25132,Sheldon,A crazy person with a long memory and if all goes according to plan a robot army.
25133,Sheldon,All right you can’t breathe our air without an inhaler he’s allergic to Earth nuts but I’m the alien.
25134,Leonard,Sheldon I need to talk to you.
25135,Raj,No. We would just walk around and see what’s what.
25136,Penny,Really? Why not?
25137,Sheldon,I didn’t say outside.
25138,Penny,Come in.
25139,Howard,No thanks.
25140,Howard,No.
25141,Penny,…chinese food right here.
25142,Sheldon,Some York Peppermint Patties a couple of Dr. Peppers and run to Best Buy and see if they have a portable DVD player and season one of a show called Hannah Montana.
25143,Howard,Okay great everybody loves their grandmas! Now come on Sheldon finish him off!
25144,Sheldon,That’s rude.
25146,Penny,Or I invite a few girlfriends ’cause hearing you say the two of us just sent a chill right down my spine.
25147,Penny,Only if it doesn’t rhyme.
25148,Penny,All right. Well you guys have fun. I guess I’ll see you Sunday night.
25149,Leonard,What are you talking about?
25150,Sheldon,If a zombie bites you you turn into a zombie. However if a mummy bites you all you turn into is some schmo with a mummy bite. So like a zombie that’s been eaten from the waist down you sir have no leg to stand on.
25151,Raj,Nothing I’m fine.
25152,Sheldon,Bye.
25153,Sheldon,No one is running anywhere. We’re not getting a dining room table.
25154,Sheldon,That presupposes Penny is tense.
25155,Howard,Fine. What do one point three billion people know about having babies?
25156,Penny,Oh.
25157,Sheldon,It’s nothing like that. I just I thought about Raj’s situation and I had a change of heart. You know and regarding your gift you said surprise me and boy did I. Hello.
25158,Raj,Of course you feel terrible. You completely screwed up your karma dude.
25159,Howard,I just got her a couple of things. She gives me things too.
25160,Raj,You still might get on a magazine.
25161,Howard,Hey we can say it. You can’t.
25162,Leonard,Not really I’m just an enthusiast.
25163,Leonard,Yeah yeah it is good. Did you want to start now?
25164,Sheldon,Hey you already ruined Thor give it a rest.
25165,Sheldon,Good. Don’t do it.
25166,Penny,I just thought it would make you happy.
25167,Leonard,Should I say something? I feel like I should say something.
25168,Leonard,Well Sheldon turns out we didn’t need you after all.
25169,Howard,What’s that?
25170,Sheldon,Good morning Friend Howard. Friend Raj. I see you gentlemen are enjoying beverages. Perhaps they would taste better out of these.
25171,Leonard,And Orcs!
25172,Raj,Good-bye Emily. That was rough you guys.
25173,Howard,Hello? What do you mean you found my dog? She’s with my friends. Is she okay? Oh thank you. Uh just text me your address I’m on my way. Oh and if she’s hungry go ahead and feed her. But do not give her anything starchy. She’s having risotto for dinner.
25174,Leonard,At least I didn’t have to invent twenty-six dimensions just to make the math come out.
25175,Raj,I wish we could do more stuff without Sheldon.
25177,Raj,Check.
25178,Leonard,It’s not what we planned but this isn’t so bad right?
25179,Leonard,Thank you.
25180,Leonard,There’s this thing online you put yourself on tape and just send it in anyone can do it.
25181,Sheldon,Nothing. Just wanted to see if you were both okay.
25182,Sheldon,You’re wrong again. If my superpower were arrogance my name would be Dr. Arroganto.
25183,Sheldon,Then there’s really no reason to live is there?
25184,Sheldon,Hi Rebecca I’m your new friend Sheldon.
25185,Raj,Okay and here’s the hook. Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning the other plays with bones.
25186,Howard,Oh so my uh parents’ 40th anniversary’s coming up and I can’t think of a thing to get them.
25187,Leonard,Okay that was uncalled for.
25188,Leonard,Yeah.
25189,Howard,I didn’t get a good look. Can I go again?
25190,Leonard,Okay well I ju… I think it’s important to remember that we move at a pace that is our speed and… oh shoot I had it!
25191,Raj,Yeah I’ve been there as well. I like your tee-shirts with the little pocket.
25193,Penny,And you think it’s better than Tennessee Williams?
25194,Penny,Oh balls.
25195,Sheldon,You know we were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command.
25196,Leonard,He’s not that bad. Hey Stuart got any plans Thursday night?
25197,Howard,We can split it two two and two.
25198,Sheldon,My good man dereliction of duty in the face of the enemy is a court-martial offense.
25199,Leonard,Oh yeah no. Turns out that Raj and Howard had to work and Sheldon had a colonoscopy and he hasn’t quite bounced back yet.
25200,Penny,Yes I can’t get my stupid door open.
25201,Penny,Sounds perfect.
25202,Howard,Peering through his telescope at the birth of the cosmos.
25203,Howard,That could have been about anyone. Besides you have nothing to worry about because now I’m the dusky half of Koothrapenny.
25204,Raj,I’m an astrophysicist. The stars don’t take a day off.
25205,Leonard,Ah you’re going off the grid.
25206,Sheldon,Just a toy robot?
25207,Leonard,Mm I don’t know. I get a lawyer he gets a lawyer it’s just easier to stand behind the tape.
25208,Sheldon,No it wasn’t. Uh now let’s tabulate the results of the experiment. I think it’s safe to say that you’re not in love with me and I’m not in love with you. And psychology has once again proved itself the doofus of the sciences.
25209,Sheldon,That is apt and amusing. I think I shall share that with Amy Farrah Fowler. She’ll appreciate the witticism.
25210,Sheldon,Leslie Winkle. Of all the overrated physicists in all the labs in all the world why does it have to be Leslie Winkle?
25211,Penny,Do you want him back?
25212,Leonard,To mend her broken heart. This situation is much less complicated. There’s some kind of dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV. She just wanted to avoid having a scene with him.
25213,Sheldon,I’m looking forward to him teaching us glove-slapping.
25214,Sheldon,No.
25215,Penny,Star Wars. They get all cranky when you mix the two up.
25216,Howard,No. I’m looking for a hookup.
25217,Sheldon,All right.
25218,Sheldon,So let’s hear from some people who were there at the very start. How Howard flashback sounds.
25219,Leonard,So do they have a name for a first date with someone you used to go out with?
25220,Sheldon,Oh I’m working on time-dependent backgrounds in string theory specifically quantum field theory in D-dimensional de Sitter space.
25221,Leonard,Hey.
25222,Howard,It’s been around for years. It’s like folk music but with a sci-fi/fantasy theme.
25223,Penny,Yes. Yes it is. Okay well um come on in.
25224,Howard,Well when someone looks at your dating profile the first thing they see is your picture. I just want to make sure you look fun and full of life and not like a body they just pulled out of the river. All right here we go and smile. Okay uh-uh that one’s in the bank. How about this? Turn away and then turn back into it. But when you do imagine the camera is the girl you want to meet.
25225,Sheldon,Well that’s not acceptable. I mean I’m her boss. She needs to be solely focused on my needs not distracted by your pasty androgynous brand of sexuality.
25226,Sheldon,I beg to differ. I used to live in those genitals. And if someone wants to move into my old room I should at least get a vote.
25227,Penny,Not where I can hear you guys.
25228,Raj,Alright why don’t we do it your way then? We’ll arrange for this girl to move in across the hall from Dennis so he can pathetically moon over her for months on end.
25229,Sheldon,It’s surprising because I generally don’t feel comfortable around well anyone.
25230,Sheldon, Howard?
25231,Penny,Wait wait who’s gonna break it to the penguin?
25232,Leonard,Hang on. Penny do you have plans for dinner?
25233,Raj,Well if Wil Wheaton and Stuart win their match and we beat lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants in the next round we’ll face off for the championship.
25234,Sheldon,I hardly think so.
25235,Penny,No.
25236,Sheldon,Really Leonard? You’re just going to try to recycle Adler’s doctrine of the inferiority complex? I could probably get that from the woman at Ralph’s. And she’d let me taste some pieces of cheese for free.
25237,Penny,Look I grew up on a farm okay from what I heard they’re either having sex or Howard’s caught in a milking machine. Do you mind if I stay here tonight?
25238,Leonard,You’re welcome. How’s your fish?
25239,Raj,I can’t believe you kissed my sister with moth mouth.
25240,Sheldon,Well maybe you should. There’s lots of books called Sherlock Holmes and there’s no books called Officer Hernandez.
25241,Howard,Hey bud.
25242,Penny,Let’s just take the test.
25243,Howard,Without me.
25244,Leonard,Yeah sure.
25245,Penny,This isn’t funny anymore. Just say no so we’re done with this. Will you marry me or not?
25246,Howard,Are you here alone?
25247,Howard,This is great.
25248,Penny,Kind of like Sheldon’s ant farm.
25249,Leonard,We are young and fun.
25250,Leonard,Did you ever do anything like this since we’ve been?
25251,Penny,Really? Boy you’d think you could trust a horde of Hungarian barbarians.
25252,Sheldon,No I made him up. I think you’d call him Lee.
25253,Penny,Who is it?
25254,Sheldon,Hello everyone. I brought my new friend Barry Kripke home for dinner.
25255,Howard,You’re nervous? I’ve been stress-eating for four days. Look at me. I’m wearing my fat pants.
25256,Leonard,Because I want to go back and keep myself from getting a time machine.
25257,Leonard,Hmm?
25258,Penny,Fine cheeseburger.
25259,Sheldon,Actually our friendship group is at capacity. But if anybody drops out you’re at the top of the list. Unless it’s Raj in which case we’ll probably get a person of colour.
25260,Howard,Maybe. If it did I’d be famous. I’d be on the cover of magazines. And then instead of living alone in my tiny apartment I’d have a big mansion.
25261,Sheldon,All right. I don’t want to but at least that makes sense.
25262,Howard,How do you know?
25263,Leonard,Oh I don’t know. Who cares? Look at me.
25264,Leonard,No problem I’m very skilled at postponing intercourse. So I guess I’ll call you and we’ll arrange another evening.
25265,Howard,Yeah she seems friendly and easy to… never mind she’s gone. You know maybe talking to people is too hard.
25266,Sheldon,Feelings? What am I a hippie at a love-in? No. The problem is she laid out a series of logical arguments that I couldn’t refute.
25267,Raj,You know he won’t be looking at other girls.
25268,Sheldon,I’ll start you off easy. Electric eel pufferfish shrimp.
25269,Penny,Come on even you checked your e-mail during the eulogy.
25270,Howard,If you were standing behind me nagging I might.
25272,Leonard,I can’t press any of the buttons with my gloves. Oh son of a bitch!
25273,Penny,Thank you.
25274,Leonard,Bifurcated uvula Sheldon!
25275,Penny,Well now we know next time we go to the farmers’ market the order is petting zoo first then buy vegetables.
25276,Leonard,Another football game?
25277,Sheldon,Leonard this is Tom.
25278,Leonard,Well hey we’re grown-ups. We can still be friends.
25279,Sheldon,And if I may get serious for a moment hosting this show has been one crazy ride. But with all its ups and downs I wouldn’t give it up for the world. Except for now when I’m giving it up. Before I sign off I’d uh I’d like to share with you all one last use for a white flag. It’s good for times like this. Good night.
25280,Sheldon,I believe it means that the U.S. Government is going to expel him from the country. He could then either return to his native India emigrate to another country that’s willing to accept him or wander the high seas as a stateless pirate. Personally I’d choose pirate.
25281,Leonard,It actually looks good Sheldon.
25282,Raj,Yeah maybe that is something. How did you find that?
25283,Penny,I haven’t been on a job interview in years. I’m really nervous.
25284,Raj,Thirty seconds.
25285,Penny,May.
25286,Penny,Oh thank you very much. Come back soon. With the other half of my tip. Hey Sheldon what are you doing here?
25287,Leonard,Well uh I can’t believe you used Sheldon’s toothbrush.
25288,Howard,I’m a little jealous of the people who get to do it.
25290,Penny,Oh. You know you can just get one of those universal remotes at Radio Shack they’re really cheap.
25291,Leonard,jISovbe’ 
25292,Sheldon,Well well well. If it isn’t Wil Wheaton the Green Goblin to my Spider-Man the Pope Paul the fifth to my Galileo the Internet Explorer to my Firefox.
25293,Penny,Ooh how about white-water rafting?
25294,Raj,Okay I guess.
25295,Sheldon,No.
25296,Penny,What was that?
25297,Sheldon,You know what they all do right?
25298,Leonard,Way to think outside but pressed right up against the box Sheldon.
25299,Penny,Well sometimes you can get free food and Wi-Fi from the neighbours. Just know you might have to marry one of ’em.
25300,Leonard,Sheldon I’m gonna get the surgery it’s no big deal. End of story.
25301,Sheldon,No. I quit. 
25302,Howard,Oh no. I hope everything’s okay.
25303,Raj,I think you’d be pleased to hear that this morning in the parking garage I saw this oil stain on the ground that was shaped just like my ex-girlfriend Lucy and I didn’t get upset at all.
25304,Sheldon,You put no thought into that.
25305,Leonard,Okay good night.
25306,Raj,Okay okay the point is that we accept your apology.
25307,Penny,Okay so so you don’t want to marry me?
25308,Raj,When we tell this story let’s end it differently.
25309,Howard,Oh dude I wish you had said something before I pounded that last Red Bull.
25310,Penny,A… are you talking to me?
25311,Leonard,I know.
25312,Leonard,What the hell is eighth base?
25314,Howard,I appreciate the offer but if things don’t work out with you two I’m swooping in on her like a vulture.
25315,Leonard,Hee-hee just classic.
25317,Raj,What? No.
25318,Sheldon,I asked if you were in the shower but that’s moot now.
25319,Sheldon,Well I should hope so. I don’t see anyone else banging on this door to put up with your nonsense. Not even a good-bye? You see that’s the kind of thing that makes people think you’re weird. Poor kid. She just doesn’t see it.
25320,Sheldon,I spent so much of my childhood at that hospital. When I was 12 I got to ride there in a helicopter.
25321,Penny,Hey guys.
25322,Penny,Okay we can’t keep explaining everything. Read that book we got you.
25323,Sheldon,Well first we don’t have house guests frankly if I could afford the rent I’d ask you to leave.
25324,Sheldon,Careful it’s that kind of sass that can get a person uninvited to this year’s Who Con.
25325,Leonard,Go go go go!
25326,Leonard,Don’t yell at me. I’m not manufacturing. I’m just Web design.
25327,Sheldon,Yes.
25328,Penny,Oh balls.
25329,Sheldon,Finally something breaks our way.
25330,Sheldon,No. She helped Barry Kripke make an advancement in string theory.
25331,Sheldon,Well it’s not what he said.
25332,Howard,Hey I was being hypothetical okay? I would never marry you.
25333,Penny,Why you guys going somewhere?
25334,Penny,My Rabe-what-ly?
25336,Penny,Well Leonard wants me to do more stuff like that with him so I thought maybe this year I’d tag along.
25337,Raj,Emily listen I’m sorry but I can’t come by.
25338,Raj,One Ring to find them.
25339,Penny,You think he’ll notice?
25340,Sheldon,Now let me see you feel bad for lying and staying in Detroit longer than you needed to.
25341,Penny,Can I bring Leonard?
25342,Sheldon,Um… she distracted me. I told you Penny I don’t have time for your nonsense I have important things to do.
25343,Leonard,Thank you.
25344,Leonard,Give me one circumstance in which that would be useful.
25345,Leonard,Now Raj kill Sheldon.
25346,Howard,But it’s beautiful.
25347,Sheldon,No I’m a little rattled. But like the flag over Fort Sumter I’m still here. And take two. Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper and welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Over the next 52 weeks you and I are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology.
25348,Howard,And I like to think I helped.
25349,Penny,Yes we’re fine.
25350,Leonard,It’s okay you can owe me.
25351,Sheldon,Mother warrior-princess franchise owner I hear glass ceilings shattering all over town.
25352,Sheldon,Sorry won’t bring their kites down. Ow! String burn! String burn!
25353,Penny,Hi!
25354,Howard,Ooh this is exciting. We’re innovating. I feel like we’re in the Facebook movie.
25355,Leonard,Okay great. Um… uh the thing is we’ve got this friend and he’s kind of down in the dumps and we thought that maybe you could cheer him up.
25356,Penny,Anyway to this day I still can’t see a box of crayons without crossing my legs.
25357,Leonard,Howard you in on this?
25358,Penny,Yes.
25359,Leonard,Stan Lee.
25360,Sheldon,You know what this place needs? A suggestion box.
25361,Raj,Okay. Penny two of the brightest stars in the night sky are Altair and Vega. And it is said they were deeply in love but forever separated by the celestial river of the Milky Way.
25362,Leonard,C’mon Raj how am I supposed to know who she’s attracted to. Or was attracted to. Or who she might be attracted to. In the future.
25363,Sheldon,For science.
25364,Sheldon,That’s the one. I believe you went last so uh please?
25365,Penny,I can laugh about it now.
25366,Howard,So who’s up for a movie?
25367,Leonard,Oh Penny you don’t want to get into it with Sheldon. The guy is one lab accident away from being a supervillain.
25368,Sheldon,It’s customary when using the rest room at a retail establishment to make a small purchase. Did you?
25369,Howard,Mm. Last night I had a dream we got so rich from the app you and I bought matching side-by-side mansions. But there was a secret tunnel connecting your front yard to my back yard. What do you think that means?
25370,Sheldon,We don’t. This is a disturbing aberration.
25371,Penny,No Sheldon I’d rather sit on this freezing cold floor sobbing like a three year-old.
25372,Leonard,The volcano thing? No.
25373,Sheldon,I’ll tell you exactly what you should do avoid the presumption of the Terran sensory input paradigm.
25374,Raj,Dude that’s my sister you’re talking about.
25375,Sheldon,Hey everybody. This is my friend Dr. Nowitzki.
25376,Raj,Thank you Howard.
25377,Howard,Oh we could set it up like a scavenger hunt where the last puzzle gives the winner Sheldon’s contact information.
25378,Raj,I’m curious what part of America is that accent from?
25379,Raj,I I think he wants us to pull over.
25380,Penny,Still haven’t heard from her?
25381,Penny,What’s wrong Superman? Locked out of your big ice thingy?
25382,Sheldon,That’s the only kind of admonishing I do.
25383,Howard,I’m going to be 30 years old and I have no one in my life to love me. I’m such a basket case I can’t even talk to a woman without having alcohol in my body.
25384,Penny,It’s not a big deal just a one night showcase but they invite a lot of casting people and agents so you never know.
25385,Leonard,You understood the math?
25386,Leonard,Okay. You want to start loading this stuff into the truck?
25387,Penny,Sweetie I know you’re trying to make me feel better and I love you for that but it’s making me feel worse and I kind of hate you. This isn’t your car.
25388,Howard,That’s very mature of you.
25389,Sheldon,Oh you’re singing. Well I’m sorry.
25390,Leonard,Oh SETI the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. You should introduce him to Sheldon. The search is over.
25391,Penny,Yeah.
25392,Raj,Oh snap.
25393,Howard,We hide behind the Dumpsters in the parking lot and ambush people when they come to pee.
25394,Raj,What are you doing right now?
25395,Sheldon,Hmm. You see your words sound reasonable but your face looks angry. Help me out here this is not where I shine.
25396,Leonard,Or we could do something we’ll all enjoy like play a board game.
25397,Raj,Sweet!
25398,Leonard,Sure.
25399,Sheldon,I’d like to do the math.
25400,Penny,Yeah and actually I drink Sauvignon Blanc.
25401,Sheldon,Yeah well who wants to spend the whole weekend running around a bunch of pretend planets battling made up monsters. That’s for babies.
25402,Penny,You can’t get fired even if you’re bad at it?
25403,Leonard,Hey you guys let Stuart live with you. Why not Raj too?
25404,Penny,What and you think I want to see a documentary about aluminium can recycling?
25405,Howard,Leonard just realized that Penny’s been hiding him from her friends because he’s a tiny little man who flies kites.
25406,Howard,Oh yeah? What if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to take a shower in the locker room and let other guys see you naked?
25407,Sheldon,What are you doing?
25408,Sheldon,A cross we all must bear. You know in difficult moments like this I often turn to a force greater than myself.
25409,Sheldon,Oh I see. Penny I’m not sure I’m comfortable harbouring a fugitive from the 2311 North Los Robles Corporation.
25410,Leonard,Hey buddy. Heard you’re having a rough day. You all right?
25411,Sheldon,Leonard excellent I want to show you something.
25412,Raj,You’re just saying that.
25414,Sheldon,No.
25415,Howard,I think you were mean before you were pregnant but it’s fine. So uh instead of cleaning out the room why don’t we just decide on a theme for the nursery?
25416,Leonard,Sure. What does he like?
25417,Penny,How’s your leg?
25418,Penny,Well thank you.
25419,Sheldon,Of course I do.
25420,Sheldon,Yes and he never unified gravity with the other forces. If he hadn’t been such a hound dog we’d all have time machines.
25421,Leonard,Leonard?
25422,Sheldon,A good wife would go to the store.
25423,Leonard,Hi!
25424,Sheldon,Well up until now I’ve had better things to do. So what are we making today?
25425,Sheldon,I’m I’m sorry; I didn’t realize you were on a date.
25426,Leonard,Aw!
25427,Penny,You couldn’t sleep either?
25428,Leonard,I just want to make sure that we’re all clear standard robotic fighting league rules apply.
25429,Howard,Material Girl needs ot be retired that is your karaoke song.
25430,Penny,No. I promise I will be here when you get back. Just go help Sheldon.
25431,Leonard,No they ended up calling me Sock Mouth. Because they took away my yo-yo and stuffed their socks in my mouth.
25432,Leonard,Uh no. Oh this is Zack. He’s a friend of ours. Zack this is Stuart. He owns the store.
25433,Sheldon,Well as you know I’ll be celebrating Amy’s birthday with her and I could use your assistance in helping me select the perfect gift.
25434,Howard,Eleven. Wait. Do I count the 200-pound Sailor Moon girl that Howard and I had a threesome with at Comic Con?
25435,Sheldon,Pardon me. Excuse me.
25436,Howard,That is that is so good!
25437,Howard,No. We would just walk around and see what’s what.
25438,Leonard,Hey.
25439,Sheldon,Good good. And your name is on the electric bill and mine isn’t. And I’m okay with that.
25440,Sheldon,I forgot my flash drive.
25441,Sheldon,Um I’m putting on lotion. Are you in or not?
25442,Sheldon,According to a recent study simply thinking about exercise even while sitting still can have physical benefits. For all you know I could be exercising right now.
25443,Howard,That depends do they have Mexican food in Cuba?
25444,Leonard,Whoa it’s a little early to start dropping J-bombs don’t you think?
25445,Leonard,We all got the Christmas card Cinnamon.
25446,Howard,Almost. Franken Berry Boo Berry Sugar Bear and the Honey Nut Cheerio bee I believe his name is Buzz.
25447,Penny,Like this?
25448,Leonard,That’s true.
25449,Raj,Yeah take advantage of that window of opportunity before it slams shut on your little dinky.
25450,Leonard,How’d you get ready so fast?
25451,Penny,Okay answer it. Just be strong. And if she starts to cry don’t make any promises. And most importantly put it on speaker so we can hear.
25452,Sheldon,Yeah well you should be. Your socks were still in it. I had to throw it away. Anyway I uh trust that you’ve resolved your conflict.
25453,Raj,Yeah. Huh. Forty-three? What the hell does that mean?
25454,Sheldon,Look at the two of us. Me a highly regarded physicist. The kind of mind that comes along once maybe twice in a generation. You the common man tired from your labours as a stockbroker or vacuum cleaner salesman or bootblack. But deep down inside apparently we’re just two peas in a pod. A regular pea and the kind of pea that comes along once maybe twice in a generation. Rain. Another great equalizer. Falling on the head of the brilliant and the unremarkable alike.  Smarty-pants.
25455,Sheldon,What are you doing in there? She can’t be in here.
25456,Raj,Bernie I just forwarded you a list of the top five lactation consultants in Los Angeles. I know my favourite but I’d love to hear what you think.
25457,Penny,Oh wow that doesn’t seem fair.
25458,Raj,Fine. But no more making fun of how I say tings.
25459,Penny,Mm-hmm yeah you don’t think I’m smart enough. You think I’m gonna be a liability. Even though I totally just used the word liability correctly in a sentence. Yeah.
25460,Raj,Come on.
25461,Penny,Oh. Okay I see. So while he was telling you things did he mention he owns not one but two Star Trek uniforms?
25462,Sheldon,Well think about it it’s a product that doesn’t spoil and you’re going to be needing them for at least the next thirty years.
25463,Sheldon,Remarkable. I’m just realizing how much Leonard’s been skating by all these years.
25464,Leonard,How’s it working out?
25465,Leonard,Leonard and Penny I’m sorry for all the trouble I’ve caused. I went to stay at Howard’s. PS Cinnamon’s with me but if you feel like messing with Sheldon tell him she’s loose in the building.
25466,Penny,No one ever bought me drinks at a bar because my brain just popped out of my shirt.
25467,Leonard,What?
25468,Leonard,Wait Sheldon’s going to be there? We all promised we weren’t going to go.
25469,Penny,Oh stop it he’ll be fine.
25470,Leonard,You can be Aquaman.
25471,Sheldon,Oh! Great roll! Now you can demolish your Soviet-style cyclotron and build the large Hadron Collider.
25472,Sheldon,Uh stop selling it kid. You won.
25473,Sheldon,In a few minutes when I gloat over the failure of this enterprise how would you prefer I do it? The standard I told you so? The classic neener-neener? Or just my normal look of haughty derision?
25474,Penny,Ooh look who’s out on a date. Pasadena’s favourite power couple Shamy.
25475,Howard,You know what? At least you guys did something. You know you you had a theory you wrote a paper you made an actual contribution. All guys like this do is just stand on other people’s work.
25476,Sheldon,Simple! You want a girlfriend Amy wants to be someone’s girlfriend. Take her off my hands. I give you my blessing.
25477,Leonard,Uh she’s your friend. Step up.
25478,Sheldon,Careful Amy. The friend of my enemy’s girlfriend is my enemy.
25479,Leonard,Me too but I paid three bucks for it.
25480,Penny,No Cinnamon ate the chocolates. That’s really bad for dogs.
25481,Sheldon,I don’t care.
25482,Sheldon,Well that’s a little hard to hear but all right. As you know the essence of diplomacy is compromise. With that in mind I propose the following. I will take Rothman’s office and you will find a way to be okay with that.
25483,Penny,That carrot was delicious.
25484,Leonard,Sheldon this was your idea. A little extra money to get fractional T1 bandwidth in the apartment.
25485,Penny,So this is the plan? From now on we’re just gonna hide out in here to avoid the Shamy?
25486,Leonard,Why do you think I’d be like that? I get it you’re taking one class. It’s nice. Maybe if it goes well you take another you enrol full-time. Ooh be sure to keep an eye on which credits transfer to a four-year college.
25487,Sheldon,You never know when two pieces of paper might temporarily need fastening in the top left corner.
25488,Leonard,Got you a little something too.
25489,Leonard,Sheldon.
25490,Leonard,That soy Frappuccino I had.
25491,Penny,Because you are not at Big Boy!
25492,Raj,Okay in Avatar when they have sex in Pandora they hook up their ponytails so we know their ponytails are like their junk.
25493,Raj,Thanks.
25494,Penny,Yeah he really is.
25495,Sheldon,Tonight is Halo night it’s like talking to a wall.
25496,Sheldon,Leonard I’m trapped in quicksand the axe is dragging me down.
25497,Howard,Keebler Elf? I’ve got your Keebler Elf right here.  Okay it’s a stalemate.
25498,Sheldon,Not Penny me!
25499,Leonard,Me neither. Oh look what I’m reading. It’s you.
25500,Sheldon,Are you sure you have enough comics? You’re going to be monitoring the telescope for 12 hours and by my estimate you’ve only selected seven hours of reading material. That’s even factoring in your difficulty in parsing American comic book idioms like Bamf and Snikt.
25501,Raj,Oh. Is it Amy?
25502,Howard,Penny. 
25503,Raj,We might as well go ahead and eat. She’s not coming back anytime soon.
25504,Leonard,Like it was ten hours ago. What about it?
25505,Sheldon,Wonderful. Now what about Euler-Lagrange theorems?
25506,Raj,That sounds amazing. First movie I’m watching Annie.
25507,Howard,Hello.
25508,Sheldon,73 is the 21st prime number. Its mirror 37 is the 12th and its mirror 21 is the product of multiplying hang on to your hats seven and three. Eh? Eh? Did I lie?
25509,Sheldon,Hi.
25510,Raj,It’s my father you jerks. Hello Daddy.
25511,Leonard,Well it matters a lot. I don’t want to be a bran muffin. I I want to be a Cinnabon you know? A strawberry Pop-Tart. Something you’re excited about even though it could give you diabetes.
25512,Leonard,All right Sheldon we’re going to Wil’s. This is your last chance.
25513,Leonard,I know. I feel so grown up.
25514,Sheldon,I don’t drink.
25515,Sheldon,I think I’ll keep it for myself.
25516,Penny,Oh that’s what Amy said. So what’s going on with the research project? Are they gonna let you run it?
25517,Sheldon,Fine. I’ll have a virgin cuba libre.
25518,Leonard,It’s just a theory. Uh it’s not even worked out.
25519,Sheldon,Oh of course. It’s right here in my hand.
25520,Sheldon,Sorry you diverted me. Anyway in 1935 Erwin Schrodinger in an attempt to explain the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics he proposed an experiment where a cat is placed in a box with a sealed vial of poison that will break open at a random time. Now since no-one knows when or if the poison has been released until the box is opened the cat can be thought of as both alive and dead.
25521,Sheldon,Typically that’s an indicator. To you know check your engine.
25522,Sheldon,I understand why no-one else bid.
25523,Sheldon,I suppose that’s one way to look at it.
25524,Penny,I didn’t say you were I just said she was cute.
25525,Sheldon,Who told you you could touch my board?
25526,Sheldon,I’m making s’mores. I wanted to alert you in case you smelled caramelizing marshmallows and thought a nearby candy factory was on fire.
25527,Leonard,We were on our way to the Chinese restaurant when we thought we saw Adam West so we followed him.
25528,Sheldon,No. They’d rather spend the holiday with each other than find out of this is the year I finally touch a starfish. Anyway I wouldn’t want the tickets to go to waste so take whomever you’d like.
25529,Penny,You know you’re gonna make up with him. Can we just skip to that part?
25530,Leonard,Come on. It’ll be fun.
25531,Leonard,So you just want us to disagree with whatever you say?
25532,Leonard,Well hey come on just tell me.
25533,Sheldon,Oh you’re right. I could never be with a woman whose self-esteem was so low she’d be with Leonard.
25534,Raj,Oh fine. Let’s agree she kissed both of us.
25535,Sheldon,Well cell service is down to one bar so if anyone needs medical attention or to tell a stranger their political views are stupid now’s the time.
25536,Sheldon,You’re really going without me?
25537,Howard,Man call spoiler alert before you say things like that.
25538,Penny,Schrodinger? Is that the woman in 2A?
25539,Penny,Yeah but they don’t have to glue the books together. How the hell are we going to make a thousand Penny Blossoms in one day?
25540,Sheldon,No I said you were teaching someone a lesson. Now let’s go.
25541,Leonard,Of course sometimes the Federation and the Romulans would enter the Neutral Zone to negotiate a temporary truce.
25542,Leonard,Well…
25543,Raj,Okay. That’s cool. I guess everybody’s involved in this project but me. So see ya.
25544,Penny,And this is also not the right time. Do not propose.
25545,Leonard,Oh.
25546,Leonard,And what are you getting him back for?
25547,Sheldon,Oh you’re right. I’m sorry.
25548,Leonard,Yes sir.
25549,Sheldon,How about your follicle-stimulating hormone levels?
25550,Sheldon,I saw you having naked sex.
25551,Leonard,Really? Great. Sheldon look. Good as new.
25552,Raj,Well obviously you don’t remember your circumcision.
25553,Raj,Course.
25554,Sheldon,They should. It’s one of the first things I plan to bring up upon arrival.
25555,Raj,She’s gonna be okay; they’re gonna let me take her home.
25556,Leonard,Uh yeah uh right here.
25557,Leonard,We did not. That’s not true. Can I speak to you alone for a second?
25558,Sheldon,I’m sorry Raj but the rules of aerial warfare dictate at the fallen kite go to the victor. And without rules the competition has no meaning. And without meaning the following would be an empty gesture.  I have your kite. I have your kite.
25559,Raj,I’ve got him Leonard. Tonight I spice my meat with goblin blood!
25560,Raj,You can’t ruin a friendship with sex. That’s like trying to ruin ice cream with chocolate sprinkles.
25561,Sheldon,The Velcro on my wrist brace caught on my shirt.
25562,Leonard,I’ve never done it on a big old pile of cash before. Me neither Leonard. It’s my first time too.
25563,Leonard,You only had one.
25564,Howard,This means a lot.
25565,Leonard,It was but one night Sheldon came home from work… 
25566,Raj,Guys this person’s just going out of their way to get a rise out of you.
25567,Penny,August 7 842 a.m. This is humiliating. What was wrong with diapers?
25568,Leonard,Yeah but I don’t see a better one on the horizon so…
25569,Howard,When did you learn how to pick locks?
25570,Leonard,This is our year! With those guys out the entire physics bowl will kneel before Zod.
25571,Sheldon,Other people might be interested.
25572,Sheldon,I hate to pile on the bad news but I just got a raise.
25573,Leonard,Well now hold on how about this? How about we still hang out but on the down-low?
25574,Leonard,Yeah I know I know that part.
25575,Sheldon,Wouldn’t you like to know?
25576,Raj,Stuart and I are putting dating profiles online and it’s one of the questions. And thank you I’d kill for that woman’s bone structure.
25577,Raj,Maybe. It’s a prime number. Encryption systems are built on prime numbers.
25578,Penny,Yes.
25579,Sheldon,It won’t work. No way to mount it.
25580,Leonard,I really appreciate this.
25581,Sheldon,You frightened me.
25582,Leonard,I’m sorry. I’ll I’ll take care of it.
25583,Sheldon,Already taken care of. Observe. This is a live shot of Kripke’s lab via a mini webcam I was able to install thanks to a dollar bill discreetly placed in the night janitor’s shirt pocket. At the same time I also secured large quantities of these chemicals above the tiles in the drop ceiling.
25584,Sheldon,I’m just in a good mood. While my compatriots are in Las Vegas I will be enjoying a blissful evening in my personal Fortress of Solitude.
25585,Penny,Not that far back!
25586,Penny,Oh yeah you know what maybe we should just slow things down a little.
25587,Penny,It was pretty good. We won.
25588,Sheldon,They were out of scones.
25589,Sheldon,Here’s an interesting fact about alcohol.
25590,Raj,Hello Hawaii. This is Dr. Koothrappali in Pasadena. I’d like you to reposition the telescope please. Scarlett Johansson’s house! I’m kidding Hawaii. Mahalo. Whoo!
25591,Sheldon,Go north. You can’t go that way. Go west. A troll blocks your passage. Okay fasten your seatbelts kill troll. With what? With sword.  You don’t have the sword. Good golly it’s as if it’s actually happening to me.
25592,Penny,Screw it. I’ll go later.
25593,Penny,What up Shel-Bot?
25594,Raj,All right. I’ve made up my mind. I’m gonna do the right thing call this girl and let her know that I’m in a relationship.
25595,Howard,I’m having my windows untinted.
25596,Penny,Wait what is going on?
25597,Leonard,Oh yes you do. You know you have a weird brother-sister-Elliott-E.T. relationship with him.
25599,Sheldon,So why is it no longer a specialty? Did the chef lose confidence in the dish or himself? And look over here shrimp in mobster sauce. What is mobster sauce?
25600,Penny,Oh yeah? Then how does the sun come up every day?
25601,Leonard,Hey I got to hand it to Raj he found a really nice spot to have a bachelor party.
25602,Penny,Yeah I don’t care I don’t care. The point is Leonard isn’t the kind of guy I usually go out with.
25603,Sheldon,Well I know but he means well. Sing.
25604,Sheldon,That’s Princess Punchali.
25605,Leonard,It’s a lot cooler when girls aren’t looking at it.
25606,Howard,My parents’ money. Uh what did you put for your best feature?
25607,Raj,What?
25608,Sheldon,I can’t be impossible. I exist. I believe what you meant to say is “I give up he’s improbable.”
25609,Sheldon,Excuse me?
25610,Howard,You are because dating two women I mean I can’t even remember the last time I slept in my own apartment. I wake up and I’m like am I at Claire’s or am I at Emily’s? Is there a third girl I’ve forgotten about? Like where am I?
25611,Sheldon,Here is a hot beverage to comfort you. It’s in a to-go cup. Make of that what you will.
25612,Raj,Just because I didn’t express myself well doesn’t mean my underlying point was invalid! You bloviating buffoon!
25614,Leonard,Right 
25615,Sheldon,Really?
25616,Leonard,Come here you.
25617,Leonard,Is it true even when the man lets his dog lick peanut butter off his tongue?
25618,Penny,Okay are you sure about this?
25619,Penny,Oh look she calls you Moon Pie. That is so cute.
25620,Sheldon,Ah that’s my girl.
25621,Sheldon,You know very well how it went.
25622,Sheldon,What do you think.
25623,Howard,But we just got tattoos. Wouldn’t we be concerned about bacterial infection?
25624,Leonard,I’m not indoorsy. I just wear the appropriate sun block because I don’t take melanoma lightly.
25625,Raj,It’s called being nice.
25626,Sheldon,If the judge couldn’t explain it to me I don’t see how you will.
25627,Leonard,Why?
25628,Raj,Really? I just made it up. Have you seen Slumdog Millionaire?
25629,Penny,You’re welcome.
25630,Penny,Yes Sheldon. Keep watching.
25631,Leonard,Got it.
25632,Raj,Don’t be silly. Sit. You look like you’ve had a long day.
25633,Sheldon,What if we were to go as dinner table favourites salt and pepper?
25634,Leonard,Oh absolutely.
25635,Sheldon,Oh don’t play the Einstein card. His great breakthroughs happened when no one knew anything. So everything was a great breakthrough.
25636,Penny,So? That’s my dinner from last night.
25637,Sheldon,You did it Leonard you stood up to your bully.
25638,Leonard,You were just humming.
25639,Penny,I knew I could smell ’em.
25640,Sheldon,She watched it. I’m gonna get that girl back.
25641,Sheldon,Changes in jet streams can affect the speed at which the Earth rotates on its axis so bad weather can actually make the day longer.
25642,Howard,We are testing a new medication for social anxiety panic attacks agoraphobia and obsessive compulsive disorder. Why would they be looking for test subjects here?
25643,Sheldon,Good good if you had said something clever she might’ve gotten suspicious.
25644,Sheldon,I’m a big boy and if I missed one I’d throw a big-boy tantrum.
25645,Leonard,Oh wait here almost forgot. Here.
25646,Penny,I want tickets to that please.
25647,Sheldon,What if every person in front of us let someone cut?
25648,Penny,Yeah. Come in.
25649,Leonard,And we lived happily ever after.
25650,Howard,Which part?
25651,Sheldon,Stop counting!
25652,Penny,He’s gonna be all right. That is sticky.
25653,Sheldon,Yes. Bazinga. Leonard?
25654,Leonard,I checked the App Store. No one is doing handwriting-recognition differential equation solving.
25655,Raj,That’s a penguin I sponsor. They’re losing their homes to global warming and my car gets like seven miles a gallon so I felt bad.
25656,Sheldon,Well good for you guys. Look I have a grease smudge on my hand and I’m okay with it.
25657,Howard,Fine I’ll leave. But it sounds like somebody needs a fresh diaper.
25658,Leonard,It’s okay. I don’t have to say them.
25659,Raj,Excuse me I thought we were trying to solve my problem?
25660,Sheldon,I need to speak to you.
25661,Leonard,What the hell was that about?
25662,Sheldon,Nice. Kick a man when he’s down.
25663,Sheldon,I know. It’s replaced Godzilla as my principle source of anxiety.
25664,Leonard,Hey.
25665,Sheldon,Arthur. I thought you were dead.
25666,Penny,Look just forget I told you about me not graduating from community college. Okay?
25667,Penny,Hang on I think the emergency key is around here somewhere.
25668,Leonard,Approaching the speed of light doesn’t slow down time. Approaching them does.
25669,Leonard,There you go. Now any e-mail from Wolowitz will go right into your spam folder.
25671,Raj,Ah.
25672,Sheldon,What’s your formula for the corner.
25673,Leonard,Although if you are gonna do it again please let me know so I can get it on video.
25674,Sheldon,Of course. First consider an ordinary magnet which has  a north and south pole. If you cut that in half you have two smaller magnets each with its own north and south pole.
25675,Raj,No problem. My treat. I’ll swing by after work.
25676,Leonard,Thank you. Finally there’s a Mrs. Hofstadter who isn’t disappointed in me.
25677,Sheldon,BRB. That’s short for be right back. I’m saving so much time.
25678,Penny,Midnight.
25679,Sheldon,Doctor Hofstadter I want you to meet my mother Mary.
25680,Raj,No never heard of ’em!
25681,Penny,Okay.
25682,Howard,Oh I take it back don’t mention me.
25683,Howard,Um well in my defence I tell everybody.
25684,Howard,Yes Rajesh Koothrappali. Look uh I just I wanted to say I’m sorry. Okay? You were like the coolest person I ever found online and I got really nervous and I I just blew it.
25685,Penny,Hmm.
25686,Sheldon,No no I’m still hopelessly stuck on that but I figured out how to figure it out.
25687,Howard,We hope. The signal has to travel over three billion miles. So it’s gonna be hours before we know if it even survived.
25688,Sheldon,Well I appreciate your concern but I won’t be seeing any more of Amy than I already do. I assume we’ll deduct any extra time we spend together at work from our weekly quota.
25689,Sheldon,It’s also your roll.
25690,Sheldon,Joke if you must but you’re going to miss these moments. With Leonard home in a few days this was your last time driving me to the grocery store.
25691,Sheldon,Oh Leonard great news. We discovered a medium-sized asteroid together.
25692,Leonard,Look I appreciate your signature blend of concern for me and incredible selfishness. If I get the chance to do this there is nothing you can say that’s going to stop me.
25693,Raj,And you do it all the time. Last week in the mall at Radio Shack we were looking for a phone with giant numbers for your mother and I suddenly realize you’re not even there.
25694,Howard,Um kind of hit a bump. When I was honest and told Emily she wasn’t the only person I was seeing it went great. So I tried the same thing with Lucy.
25695,Sheldon,And if water is involved we’re going to have to ground the crap out of the thing.
25696,Raj,Well you’ve probably never had to do this stuff ’cause you’re young and beautiful and men have always thrown themselves at you.
25697,Penny,Yes?
25698,Sheldon,I’m going to find her and ask her to marry me. And if she says yes we can put this behind us and resume our relationship. And if she says no well then she can just ponfo miran.
25699,Sheldon,I’m invoking the Skynet clause of our friendship agreement.
25700,Leonard,I also love you.
25701,Howard,Yeah well I wouldn’t get too close. If I give the right command in German she’ll rip your face off.
25702,Sheldon,Welcome aboard old chum.
25703,Penny,Probably. I’m just enjoying the foreplay. Does this mean you are done mocking my acting career?
25704,Sheldon,Your characterization of approximately 171 different men as a few.
25706,Penny,Really?
25707,Howard,What?
25708,Raj,Of course. What?
25709,Howard,Yeah. He’s 24. He’s a deejay. He brews his own beer. He’s got awesome tattoos. Dude he’s got a hot girlfriend too.
25710,Leonard,I didn’t agree with him.
25711,Raj,Whatever you like.
25712,Leonard,Got it. So can I see you again?
25713,Sheldon,It’s a warm summer evening in ancient Greece…
25714,Raj,It was a nice retirement party.
25715,Penny,Hey I’m sorry about today. And I promise next time I get married it won’t be a joke. It’ll be for love. Or money.
25716,Penny,Then no.
25717,Howard,Great. It’s not like I brought it up because I wanted to go.
25718,Raj,I feel like I’ve been called down to the principal’s office. Although I wouldn’t mind if Brown Sugar suspended me. From a sex swing. This may have been a mistake.
25719,Howard,Yay.
25720,Leonard,Alright um just uh let me get my keys.
25721,Penny,An acting choice.
25722,Leonard,They’d say why does he touch himself so much?
25723,Howard,It it doesn’t matter. Howard has a girlfriend.
25725,Sheldon,Oh it’s hardly hacking when you use the same password for everything Kal-el.
25726,Sheldon,No. No I’ve changed. Like the frog who’s put in a pot of water that’s heated so gradually he doesn’t realize he’s boiling to death.
25727,Leonard,We don’t ask Sheldon things like that.
25728,Penny,Leonard you’re back.
25729,Penny,Yeah you know the sad thing is it’s really not. Ooh is this one of those paintball guns?
25730,Sheldon,You’re bluffing.
25731,Penny,Oh you really sleep on the sidewalk huh?
25732,Sheldon,What’s the big deal? It’s full of classified information about the air force project.
25733,Penny,Whatever. Look if Zack and I had just gone to a regular club or a party it would have been fine but this with the costumes and you.
25735,Howard,Okay who gets the extra dumpling?
25736,Penny,I’m sorry and what flavour is your bubble gum cigar?
25737,Sheldon,Don’t be melodramatic. I’m just getting on a train and leaving forever.
25738,Sheldon,There you go perfect.
25739,Penny,Going online to buy shoes!
25740,Leonard,What are you doing?
25741,Sheldon,Hey it’s not even called the Genius Grant it’s the MacArthur Fellowship. Just like it’s not Frankenstein it’s Frankenstein’s Monster. Which brings us back to that hulking simpleton over there. And if anyone’s a genius it’s me for the way I brought that full circle.
25742,Leonard,No it’s nice to see you enjoying a holiday beverage. Pretty Christmassy.
25743,Sheldon,Look at the 4K resolution. Next time we Skype I’m gonna count all those nostril hairs.
25745,Penny,Now?
25746,Howard,I don’t have plans which is why I booked time on the big telescope that night.
25747,Raj,That is a great idea.
25748,Howard,You enjoy giving people grades.
25749,Leonard,Oh yeah two zero zero eight NQ sub seventeen.
25750,Penny,I seem to be losing.
25751,Penny,Sweetie let me put this in a way you’ll understand. From the waist down my shields are up.
25752,Leonard,Why is there a hole here?
25753,Raj,So how were your holidays?
25754,Howard,Yeah I think we’re getting close.
25755,Raj,Thanks Barry. Siri remind me Friday morning to make my famous popovers.
25756,Sheldon,Two tea bags in one cup? You’re not at a rave.
25757,Penny,Anguish?
25758,Sheldon,Well I know this is a difficult time for you. You’re losing your apartment you’re in debt and you just you must be humiliated.
25759,Howard,What would you name him?
25760,Howard,Sorry I started without you. I’m a little nervous. It’s been a long time since I’ve been on a date.
25761,Howard,No because she wants to have sex with me in a graveyard.
25763,Leonard,Some things are more important than toys. 
25764,Howard,Oh that’s a shame he’s gonna be devastated.
25765,Penny,Gummy bears? Thank you.
25766,Sheldon,Howard are you having a make your own sundae bar?
25767,Leonard,Uh-uh.
25768,Sheldon,Forget! You want me to forget? This mind does not forget. I haven’t forgotten a single thing since the day my mother stopped breast feeding me. It was a drizzly Tuesday.
25769,Sheldon,Muggles.
25770,Howard,We’re having a conversation about probing the heinies of superheroes. There are no stupid questions.
25771,Penny,Yeah I’m busy so goodnight.
25772,Leonard,A little.
25773,Leonard,You could have waited until morning. I know look who I’m talking to.
25774,Sheldon,Alone?
25775,Sheldon,Let’s see. Oh this person is most famous for never having gotten his nose mutilated with elective surgery and never living the rest of his life in the shadows as a hideous disfigured freak.
25776,Leonard,Sheldon I don’t need an alibi. Nobody’s going to ask about last night as long as you just zip your lip.  Thankyou. Now don’t worry everything is going to be fine. (Sheldon writes “I doubt it” on Leonard’s whiteboard.
25777,Penny,Seriously I have a great idea for one.
25778,Raj,I can’t believe this is only 64 calories.
25779,Sheldon,Of Texas.
25780,Sheldon,Yeah and you’re still eating our food.
25781,Penny,Is is everything okay.
25782,Howard,Better. I guess the news just hit me a lot harder than I expected.
25783,Penny,No. He was a beloved member of the family.
25784,Sheldon,Mm-hmm.
25785,Sheldon,They had a terrible time of it Leonard.
25786,Howard,Okay. Here we go say cheese. Iskip) Say cheese. Iskip) Say cousin. Iskip) Say…
25787,Sheldon,I’ve decided to take your advice and have arranged to go on a date with Amy Farrah Fowler.
25788,Penny,Leonard you’re… you’re giggling in your sleep.
25789,Sheldon,Hello? Oh Chancellor Morton how are you sir? Yes I was expecting your call  Problem.
25790,Sheldon,Agreed. Wait till you hear how he dumbs down Werner Heisenberg for the crowd. You may actually believe you’re in a comedy club.
25791,Howard,Go Monte! Go Monte!
25792,Leonard,What do you want to do? You want to come with me or do you want to sit here alone?
25793,Sheldon,One Star Trek The Next Generation phaser. That’s Leonard’s.
25794,Raj,Maybe we can go up to Napa Valley. They’ve got that wine train.
25795,Leonard,Oh great well the key to acquiring proficiency in any task is repetition.
25796,Sheldon,Perhaps the emotion you’re referring to was shock at you having something cleaned.
25797,Sheldon,Well of course I… oh! Yeah I have an idea let’s throw Leonard a kick ass birthday party.
25798,Raj,We just told you.
25799,Leonard,Not yet but I can remove unwanted hair from two miles away.
25800,Leonard,Oh that’s too bad.
25801,Penny,Well you’re losing your son.
25802,Leonard,I will. Excuse me.
25803,Howard,Wait are you saying that we didn’t have a vibe?
25804,Raj,He never touched my telescope.
25805,Leonard,Oh of course because I’m the only adult around here.
25806,Sheldon,Wait no no. No. The word is Polish. See look. Polish sausage. And the the model of the solar system developed by Nicolaus Copernicus a Polish astronomer. And then finally if that wasn’t enough which it should have been this is Madame Curie killing herself by discovering radium who although she was a naturalized French citizen was Polish by birth.
25807,Raj,Oh man. Scooter sucks. He’s the Aquaman of the Muppet Babies.
25808,Sheldon,All right then I have no choice but to go on to plan B.
25810,Howard,Yup.
25811,Sheldon,Well seems like a bit of a let down after our lichen conversation but what do you know you’re half swan.
25812,Howard,Oh what’s the point of everything?
25813,Sheldon,It’s good.
25814,Leonard,When is the time?
25815,Howard,Psh what a bunch of crybabies. No guts no glory man.
25816,Penny,Okay look. We’re not really me and him.
25817,Leonard,One across is Aegean eight down is Nabakov twenty-six across is MCM fourteen down is… move your finger… phylum which makes fourteen across Port-au-Prince. See Papa Doc’s capital idea that’s Port-au-Prince. Haiti.
25818,Leonard,Did you make it clear that it’s two different train cars turned into hot dog stands?
25820,Sheldon,Well rest assured I am in full possession of my faculties.
25821,Leonard,We think we can help you with your stage fright.
25822,Sheldon,And I saw Jabba the Hutt riding by on a motorcycle. Although that was right after the Tasing so who can say for sure?
25824,Sheldon,Stand by for my upcoming tat.
25825,Howard,Over what?
25826,Penny,We turned your room into a sex dungeon.
25827,Sheldon,It’s on bitch.
25828,Sheldon,I usually don’t put too much stock in charms and talismans. However even I must admit feeling Richard Feynman’s butt dent cupping my own bottom that does get the creative juices flowing.
25829,Raj,And he’s all white.
25830,Sheldon,Well you be sure to let us know when you win the Nobel Prize for boysenberry.
25831,Penny,No. Something’s going on. What’s wrong with it? I remember you saying how great it would be to have a first edition.
25832,Penny,Stare at them and make them feel uncomfortable.
25833,Penny,We’re going to Disneyland. He’s going to eat junk food.
25834,Sheldon,Hmmm? She certainly has the symmetry and low body fat that western culture deems desirable. It’s noteworth that at other points in history heavier women were the standard for beauty because their girth suggested affluence.
25835,Leonard,How about the toaster oven?
25836,Penny,You guys are going out two nights in a row?
25837,Raj,Then I’d take you home slip off your little black dress and just pile-drive you into oblivion.
25838,Leonard,No I don’t need any fish nibbling my business.
25839,Howard,Hang on.
25840,Sheldon,Oh no he broke my collarbone. I can still hear it click.
25841,Sheldon,Uh guys it sounds like you’re getting angry again.
25842,Leonard,Over puppets?
25843,Leonard,I’m sorry. Just just give me another chance.
25844,Penny,Howard here’s the difference. The possibility exists that Leonard could have a birthday party before hell freezes over.
25845,Raj,Thanks a lot.
25846,Raj,Wait. Are we starting now? Or is that what you’re going to say when we do start or…
25847,Penny,Well why not?
25848,Raj,Okay you got me there. You here looking for money?
25849,Howard,Oh Ooh maybe we could get one of those party buses to take us there.
25850,Raj,Spending Valentine’s Day with Emily.
25851,Penny,Did he just somehow give me the finger?
25852,Sheldon,At my age do you know how I’m statistically most likely to die?
25853,Penny,No I know. It’s long overdue. So what ya doing? Better not be building a robot girlfriend.
25855,Sheldon,Okay babe let’s do this.
25856,Raj,What makes them think they’re always in charge of everything?
25857,Sheldon,This is interesting. Apparently a key component in some forms of humour is the element of surprise.
25858,Leonard,Oh uh building manager. They have to fix a pipe so the water will be off tomorrow from noon to two.
25859,Leonard,I’m still not adjusted to how the SyFy channel spells their name now. S-Y-F-Y. That’s siffy.
25860,Howard,Okay.
25861,Leonard,No no. Maybe a little.
25863,Raj,Great.
25864,Penny,Oh yeah I know that place. What do you think?
25865,Raj,Here you go.
25866,Raj,Twice a month.
25867,Penny,Hey don’t name him. Just jab a hook in his face.
25868,Sheldon,Hmm what do you think?
25869,Leonard,They might be smarter than some people.
25870,Penny,Thanks for the update 
25871,Howard,I’m glad that men are wearing hats again. They’re so distinguished.
25872,Penny,Well you defended me right?
25873,Howard,Actually it’s for both of us. Last night I watched West Side Story and I’m a little freaked out by street gangs.
25874,Sheldon,Leonard these rental tuxedos have been worn by hundreds of sweaty strangers. I don’t like my own sweat touching my skin how do you think I feel about theirs?
25875,Leonard,I don’t know. When I’m in bed with a girl it’s just it’s my go to response.
25876,Raj,Hey this pregnancy had an emotionally-needy third wheel way before you came along.
25877,Leonard,Please don’t be mad.
25878,Leonard,With all these women chasing me I kind of do feel like Captain Kirk.
25879,Howard,Relax it’s Nyquil.
25880,Penny,Okay sweetie let me tell you exactly how that would have gone down.
25881,Penny,I didn’t mean shut up.
25882,Penny,No they said I was too perky.
25883,Howard,Uh… blackened salmon?
25884,Penny,Great well what do I have to do?
25885,Leonard,You think that’d help?
25886,Raj,Okay uh will I get to see you tomorrow?
25887,Raj,Are you willing to risk it?
25888,Raj,Yes you made that brutally clear to me. What I was going to suggest is if that you’re willing to wait until Sunday morning the Google satellite will be over Pasadena. You can have a wedding photograph from space.
25889,Raj,I’ll try it. Like this?
25890,Leonard,Yes I remember.
25891,Penny,Holy smokes.
25892,Raj,That’s disgusting dude.
25893,Sheldon,Oh you are killing me.
25894,Penny,Are you sure? Come on it’s Halloween.
25895,Leonard,You cannot possibly be that arrogant.
25896,Leonard,Sheldon I got you your tangerine chicken. I hope you’re hungry.
25897,Penny,How come you didn’t go into work today.
25898,Raj,Oh okay Leonard?
25899,Leonard,I don’t care. I don’t have anything to hide.
25900,Sheldon,I reject them all.
25901,Penny,Inevitable you say?
25902,Leonard,So Mom you haven’t seen Penny since we got engaged.
25903,Penny,Oh. We were just talking about how much we love working with you. Isn’t that right? Dan?
25904,Leonard,Uh-oh hang on.
25905,Sheldon,Of course it’s not you’re only a level 25 the Hungarians are just using you for dragon fodder.
25906,Leonard,All right just stop. This is ridiculous.
25907,Sheldon,You’re good friends with Penny right?
25908,Leonard,I don’t want to talk about it.
25909,Penny,Well yeah sure. When you put it that way. But it all worked out right?
25910,Leonard,Sounds like a great plan.
25911,Penny,I missed you so much.
25912,Sheldon,The smartest? All right you know I may not have a firm grasp on sarcasm but even I know that was a doozy. Leonard you can’t live in fear of this man forever.
25914,Leonard,No they’re not.
25915,Howard,Which celebrity would you say I look like the most?
25917,Leonard,Well he’s been having a couple of tough days. I’m sure he’s fine. He probably just needs a little alone time to decompress.
25918,Leonard,Really what changed?
25919,Leonard,Well I had to you see what he’s like.
25920,Raj,Beefaroni and a show? How do you turn that down?
25921,Sheldon,Oh you know what they say the best things in life are free.
25922,Raj,That’s why I already cleaned up in here and all the other rooms in the hall.
25923,Leonard,Okay that should do it.
25924,Penny,Alright Sheldon let’s just calm down and we’ll call the building manager he’ll come open your door you just eat your dinner here while you’re waiting.
25925,Raj,Can’t believe Bert has a girlfriend and I don’t.
25926,Sheldon,Eat? My dinner? In your apartment?
25927,Howard,Do you know what he did. He watched me work for ten minutes and then started to design a simple piece of software that could replace me.
25928,Penny,Sheldon what’s the point?
25929,Sheldon,You weren’t the ball.
25930,Sheldon,Where exactly does the half-sandwich come from? Are you giving me half of someone else’s sandwich or do I have to wait for someone else in the restaurant to order the other half?
25931,Sheldon,Bernadette before you change the subject does anyone have any final comments on Leonard’s faulty digestive system?
25932,Raj,No problem. How’s your mom feeling?
25933,Raj,It’s pretty cool they’ve got me in with a guy who’s doing something about hunger in Indonesia and a psychotherapist who’s using dolphins to rehabilitate prisoners and Ellen Page star of the charming independent film Juno.
25934,Penny,Okay I got a box but there’s no key in here. Just letters.
25935,Raj,She’s not hiding. She needed privacy to call her grandmother who’s apparently very sick. Oh and then I believe she has to wash her hair.
25936,Leonard,Doctor and Mrs Koothrappali in all fairness it wasn’t entirely Raj’s fault.
25937,Sheldon,Oh!
25938,Sheldon,No?
25939,Sheldon,Thank you. My mother is very excited. She’s convening her Bible study group to listen in and then pray for my soul.
25940,Leonard,Great. That’ll be five dollars. I am having the best time. I’m so glad you suggested we do this.
25941,Sheldon,Perhaps you’d prefer this one. The itsy bitsy spider is not an insect at all because it haseight legs and two body parts.
25942,Sheldon,A precocious little Internet show known as Fun With Flags.
25943,Sheldon,Bert? I wanted to let you know that I read your research and your award is well-deserved.
25944,Penny,Why’d you get that? You hate lamb.
25945,Penny,He is cuter now that I know he’s rich.
25946,Sheldon,Fine let’s go. Thank you for letting me sleep on your couch.
25947,Sheldon,And Emily I’m sorry for saying dermatologists aren’t real doctors. And I’m sure you’re tired of hearing that.
25949,Sheldon,Topic one. Faster-than-light particles at CERN paradigm-shifting discovery or another Swiss export as full of holes as their cheese? And converse.
25950,Sheldon,I want you to know that that is sincere. I do feel bad. I’m not just saying it to be included on your trip.
25951,Leonard,Lesser Warlord of Ka’a.
25952,Penny,Well I’ve never been friends with any of my exes.
25954,Sheldon,You really think so?
25955,Sheldon,Or the chainsaw.
25956,Sheldon,That feels like a bonus question. I’m going to stop here while I’m ahead but I’ve had a great time.
25957,Penny,Okay so we’re getting this one?
25958,Penny,Okay look Zack come on. You know neither of us thought this was real. I mean we were married by an Elvis impersonator.
25959,Penny,He’s counting hobbits and superheroes right?
25960,Howard,Look at us sneaking around in the middle of the night like a couple of cat burglars.
25961,Leonard,Yeah but uh think about what this represents. The fact that we can do this is the only way of definitively proving that there are man-made objects on the moon put there by a member of a species that only 60 years before had just invented the airplane.
25962,Howard,Nobody can.
25963,Sheldon,The supermarket was out of my regular fabric softener. If this one under or over-softens I’ll need time to make things right.
25964,Howard,All right it’s almost game time. Get it? Game of Thrones game time?
25965,Leonard,Oh okay alright good.
25966,Sheldon,You fellows are planning a party for me aren’t you?
25967,Leonard,Why is it odd?
25968,Penny,Oh. Wow. Good job. Okay um can you do this?
25969,Leonard,See you. 
25971,Howard,A Romulan battle bagel?
25972,Sheldon,Or caffeine tobacco sushi soft cheese processed meats and jacuzzis which can all be harmful to an unborn baby.
25973,Sheldon,No. Hmmm. What happens if you use argon lasers instead of helium neon?
25974,Leonard,You hate Babylon 5.
25975,Penny,Oh actually that’s okay. we already have…
25976,Sheldon,I understand why you’re upset.
25977,Leonard,Oh Bernadette please play my clarinet.
25978,Sheldon,What?
25979,Howard,I don’t. I have a hole in my belly button that may or may not have been a piercing.
25980,Leonard,Well maybe we can get some time on the supercomputer.
25981,Howard,The fires of Mount Doom?
25982,Leonard,She’s in.
25983,Sheldon,Forgive me as you know I’m no adept at reading facial cues but I’m going to take a stab here you’re either sad or nauseated.
25984,Raj,Eh. Although to be fair I watched E.T. build a telephone out of a Speak & Spell and an umbrella. Dude was like a little brown MacGyver.
25985,Sheldon,Well if you want to see less of me maybe we should go out again.
25986,Penny,Yeah if that’s your idea of what’s cool you should get one.
25987,Sheldon,Leonard are you in the shower?
25988,Penny,What? Oh why would he say that?
25989,Penny,Oh come on what is that?
25990,Penny,Okay go home crazy man.
25991,Leonard,Yeah. Go ahead open it.
25992,Sheldon,Me. Sorry Leonard.
25993,Penny,What? Where did you get 171 men?
25994,Sheldon,I suppose that works.
25995,Howard,Yeah. Absolutely. It wouldn’t kill you to take a Pilates class with me now and then but you have a certain wiry appeal.
25996,Sheldon,You know it just occurred to me if there are an infinite number of parallel universes in one of them there’s probably a Sheldon who doesn’t believe parallel universes exist.
25997,Howard,Well this is all your fault.
25998,Howard,He’s living at my place so I’m living here.
25999,Howard,You’re welcome.
26000,Penny,Oh that’s okay a lot of the guys’ girlfriends don’t know football. They just kind of drink and talk in the kitchen.
26001,Sheldon,It is. Aligns the lumbar cradles the coccyx balances the buttocks. This is a chair worthy of the name.
26002,Raj,Ordinary yet I sense it is dripping with magical potential.
26003,Howard,Right yeah right. But what do you think?
26004,Leonard,Oh.
26005,Sheldon,Structure constant structure. One atom…
26006,Penny,Yeah Leonard and I are gonna be cooking all day.
26007,Howard,Maybe there are other things we have in common. Come dinnertime do you enjoy eating food?
26009,Leonard,That is a tough one. Uh I know he brushes both of them.
26010,Sheldon,No I don’t drink coffee.
26011,Leonard,No wait! If anyone asks you where I went you don’t know.
26012,Sheldon,You are happy?
26013,Howard,You should’ve seen your face.
26014,Sheldon, Amy? I’ll get right to the point. I think we need to end this relationship so just sign this with your finger and uh please don’t cry on my iPad I didn’t get AppleCare.
26015,Howard,I took the liberty of burning us a mix of heroic questing music.
26016,Penny,Nothing. Diet coke. And yoghurt. A little nail polish.
26017,Sheldon,They made me promise I wouldn’t talk.
26018,Raj,Oh what’s the point of everything?
26019,Howard,The lonely guy and the two happy couples? I’d rather get a prostate exam from a leper who walks away with nine fingers.
26020,Sheldon,No. As a fight it was excellent. She used harsh language and slammed the door. Although as I say this that might not have been what you were asking.
26021,Sheldon,You’re dodging the question I knew it was you. What was that?
26022,Howard,There’s got to be a smarter way of removing it.
26024,Raj,Ooh Mark Harmon he’s a dreamboat.
26025,Sheldon,I’m not going to a cabin in the woods. Did you see the movie Cabin in the Woods?
26026,Raj,When did he leave?
26027,Penny,I think we’re there.
26028,Raj,Oh Penny. That’s ridiculous. You know you love him. You you look him in the eyes and you say it.
26029,Leonard,Your attendance implies it’s not.
26030,Raj,Come on guys! Hurry up! Hurry up!
26031,Raj,Which is?
26032,Leonard,Thank you.
26033,Sheldon,So your solution is to promote me and pay me more money so that I can impart my knowledge to the next generation of scientists?
26035,Leonard,I never thought I’d say these words but come on nose spider.
26036,Sheldon,He doesn’t need them he’s already got a 640 connect switch
26037,Sheldon,So what? His observation of high-energy positrons has provided the first conclusive evidence for the existence of galactic dark matter.
26038,Raj,Gotcha. I’ll have a Brandy Alexander.
26039,Penny,Sheldon’s in jail.
26040,Sheldon,Oh. I guess you’re just friends with anybody.  Aagh!
26041,Sheldon,Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Betty and Veronica? Ugh.
26042,Sheldon,If that’s sarcasm please save it for our enemies.
26043,Howard,Seriously guys I don’t want to know.
26044,Leonard,No that was a different guy.
26045,Leonard,Oh I have so many things to tell your biographer.
26046,Raj,What do you mean not really?
26047,Sheldon,Happy Halloween.  If it’s any consolation I thought that homo-habilus line really put him in his place.
26048,Penny,Go away Sheldon.
26049,Raj,These here parts?
26050,Penny,Why are you smiling?
26051,Sheldon,You’re soft. This world’s going to chew you up and spit you out.
26052,Sheldon,Question one where are my pants?
26053,Penny,Okay. Are are you hoping to get it telepathically?
26054,Sheldon,I saw my mommy with a naked man and she was trying to be a mommy again.
26055,Raj,Ooh fire demon. Sheldon’s turning up the heat.
26056,Leonard,Hold on. We always do this.
26057,Leonard,They texted me.
26058,Sheldon,You know I’m not sure. You know you’d have to ask him. Excuse me.  Aah. Leonard I hurt myself again.
26059,Leonard,I don’t know. We just started to think about this. Maybe I’ll move in with Penny or maybe she and I’ll take this place and you can move across the hall.
26060,Leonard,You think Penny’s right? Were we bullying Zack?
26061,Penny,Was this supposed to be a date?
26062,Raj,As it turns out yes.
26063,Howard,Can I pour you some wine? I think you’ll enjoy it. The traditional choice with Peking duck is a Sauvignon Blanc but Siri suggested an off-dry Riesling. I wasn’t sure but I didn’t want to have an argument with her in the middle of Trader Joe’s. Now what should we put Siri in for dinner? Leopard sparkles or to paraphrase Coco Chanel you can never go wrong with a little black case. Siri play some smooth jazz.
26064,Howard,Oh that’s great. I’ve been wanting her to meet you guys too so this seems like the perfect opportunity.
26065,Leonard,Got it. Can I have my water?
26066,Howard,What took you so long?
26067,Penny,Well who cares what I think? What do you think?
26068,Sheldon,Although a few minutes ago would have been better.
26069,Penny,No problem.
26070,Howard,Me too.
26071,Sheldon, Raj.
26072,Leonard,That’s a good idea. There’s a bed in there and I’m very very very pro-bed.
26073,Penny,Is there any chance I’ll learn to love it?
26074,Sheldon,The alternative would be to think backwards. And that’s just remembering.
26075,Penny,Oh ha-ha oh. That’s amazing.
26076,Howard,Yes Mummy was right. American girls are sexually voracious devils.
26077,Leonard,The laser?
26078,Leonard,Is your brother out of prison?
26079,Sheldon,An original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure.
26080,Sheldon,Well what if it’s his only way out? I can’t risk it. Here is twelve dollars. Now we’re even. Wait wait wait I bought a card. Give me two dollars. And for the record this is why I hate gift-giving.
26081,Leonard,What? I don’t want to do that.
26082,Sheldon,Boy double-sixes again. You know if I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes I wouldn’t believe it. I wonder how long we’re gonna be stuck here.
26083,Leonard,Well you’ll ski I’ll fall but yeah we will be in Switzerland for Valentine’s Day.
26084,Leonard,Is that a pregnancy test?
26085,Howard,Everybody knows genetic diversity produces the strongest offspring. Why not put a little mocha in the family latte.
26086,Leonard,It’s just for my notebooks. Thanks Penny.
26087,Penny,Hey.
26088,Sheldon,Sarcasm. Good-bye.
26089,Leonard,Bifurcated uvula Sheldon!
26090,Penny,Why are you asking me?
26091,Leonard,What did she say? Is she still mad at me?
26092,Penny,Okay. Well thank you. Oh God no I can’t. Sheldon honey I don’t want things to be weird between us.
26093,Howard,Unlikely but it could be a dwarf planet.
26094,Penny,Uh do you guys mind if I start?
26095,Howard,That’s how much we’re gonna melt people’s faces off.
26096,Sheldon,Coming Kripke. Okay. Harness seems to be secure. Small amount of incontinence just now but the website said that’s to be expected. Hey this isn’t so bad. A bit like vertical swimming.
26097,Penny,Okay. Good.
26098,Leonard,Well what did she mean by that? Was that just a generic platitude or was that a subtle bid for attention?
26099,Raj,This is great.
26100,Sheldon,Is that regular or honey nut?
26101,Penny,Yeah honey you’ll be fine as long as you don’t do that bungee cord thing okay?
26102,Sheldon,Yeah but ours can recognize a specific data stream among background noise.
26103,Leonard,And you actually got in a pool?
26104,Leonard,I drove Mother. I’m driving now.
26105,Penny,I am not your squeeze. There is no squeezing.
26106,Sheldon,I was going to name him Herman von Helmholtz but he’s so zazzy.
26107,Leonard,It was pretty cool.
26108,Penny,Really? Why is that?
26109,Sheldon,Professor Hawking?
26110,Leonard,So what is it you’re doing?
26111,Leonard,I wish that all the time. Usually before I blow out birthday candles.
26112,Leonard,Hang on. You travelled across the entire country and never left a train station?
26113,Howard,Okay.
26114,Leonard,It’s not funny.
26115,Sheldon,Thank you. Not necessary. We know everything there is to know about kissing. It requires 34 facial muscles and 112 postural muscles.
26116,Leonard,That’s awesome. Is this for Serial Ape-ist?
26118,Leonard,No it’s all over.
26119,Leonard,The clue must be in the bag.
26121,Howard,You know we’re not that far from Vazquez Rocks.
26122,Howard,Yeah right. Wait is it rose gold? Actually don’t tell me I want to be surprised.
26123,Leonard,Fine. We’ll take it right now.
26124,Sheldon,He’s not here. Maybe the Avenger summoned him.
26125,Howard,Is that the American idiom for giant big-ass desk?
26126,Penny,Oh Sheldon we didn’t bring any.
26127,Sheldon,I think you mean telekinetically. And no I just wasn’t sure of the proper protocol now that you and Leonard are no longer having coitus.
26128,Sheldon,Oh I don’t know. He kind of looks like a jerk. How about this one?
26129,Penny,Oh gee dad he’d love to but Leonard has to work in the morning.
26130,Penny,I suddenly wish Sheldon was here.
26131,Leonard,Peter Jackson’s office in New Zealand. It wasn’t ours.
26132,Howard,I know. You guys should totally be making out with me.
26133,Penny,Aaaaaaah!
26134,Leonard,Sorry.
26135,Sheldon,I was acting odd intentionally.
26136,Howard,Yeah well all the other comments said really nice things. Focus on those.
26137,Penny,Oh okay. So you’re saying this is my fault?
26138,Leonard,How is that a new invention?
26139,Howard,I didn’t crash it okay? My playlist was too up-tempo I got light-headed and I fell off. Okay. It all comes down to this.
26140,Sheldon,It’s not a touch phobia it’s a germ phobia. If you’d like to go put on a pair of latex gloves
26141,Sheldon,Agreed. Most primates don’t show that sort of discretion. A female bonobo will copulate with a new male in front of the old one without so much as a how do you do?
26142,Sheldon,First of all when you say things like that people think you’re crazy. Second the reason I’m cancelling is because I have to attend a memorial service for Professor Tupperman.
26143,Raj,That’s it we’re dead.
26144,Sheldon,I’m familiar with everything but go on.
26146,Raj,Okay you got me there but you’re wrong about this!
26147,Sheldon,No more than Penny.
26148,Sheldon,Looking into the blank innocent eyes of a creature that couldn’t begin to comprehend anything I was saying? Basically just another day at the office.
26150,Raj,Foamy vengeance.
26151,Sheldon,Thanks for giving me your limited edition Green Lantern lantern.
26152,Sheldon,Ha! I knew it. All right. We have a lot of information to cover before your first test. Which by the way is in eight minutes. The good news is I’m grading on a curve so you’re pretty much guaranteed a C.
26153,Penny,That’s what I said to the woman who had her legs wrapped around his neck.
26154,Leonard,Hold on. When did Priya get here?
26155,Sheldon,You sounded in distress. I was worried something unpleasant was happening to you. Like a murder. Or spontaneous coitus with Leonard.
26156,Leonard,I don’t care. Two millimetres? That doesn’t seem right.
26157,Sheldon,Is it better than your idea to move to Los Angeles and become a famous actress?
26158,Howard,I’d like to tell them things are going well.
26159,Sheldon,I never met them. That’s what made them perfect there were no awkward hellos in the halls there was no clickety-clacking of high heel shoes on hardwood floors they may as well have been a family of cats just jumping around from drape to drape without that annoying ammonia urine smell.
26160,Leonard,Hello boys.
26162,Sheldon,When when we were apart I learned how important you are to me. And I realize that when two people are in love sometimes they…
26163,Sheldon,Please. Even assuming you could answer any question the way I would the algorithms used by matchmaking sites are complete hokum.
26164,Howard,Oh come on.
26165,Leonard,Those are not mine.
26166,Leonard,That doesn’t work any more. He just thinks I’m taking him to the doctor. So now that you’re no longer invested in string theory what are you gonna pursue?
26167,Penny,Whoa whoa give me a second to catch up here. Hold on. 
26168,Raj,But he’s right Papa listen to him.  You! You are the one who ruined everything!
26169,Penny,Look sweetie relationships aren’t about money okay? It’s about respect and having things in common and… yes Sheldon?
26170,Leonard,Where you going with this Raj?
26171,Penny,No at the sub shop we were only making out.
26172,Raj,What’s the big deal? You guys are bringing your girlfriends. I didn’t want to sit by myself.
26173,Raj,All the wealthy and beautiful people in movies ride Jet Skis. That can’t just be a coincidence.
26174,Sheldon,Look everyone. Wil Wheaton is my friend!
26175,Sheldon,Well you didn’t discover him you merely noticed he was here much like he did with 2008 NQ sub 17.
26176,Leonard,That’s a nice way of looking at it.
26177,Raj,And I will return to New Delhi in triumph atop a bejeweled white elephant. And you know what will be on that elephant’s back? A seat warmer. No Father you may not have a ride.
26178,Penny,Six thirty.
26179,Leonard,I’m not there because I’m taking things slow. Which by the way compared to you guys approaches warp speed. And take down that camera.
26180,Leonard,Whose tongue?
26181,Sheldon,Yeah I did but then Wil called Amy a pain in the A-S-S. She got huffy and left then Wil and I headed out to dinner. That place really did remind me of my hometown. Because there we also have a HomeTown Buffet.
26182,Penny,Um I brought coffee. I wasn’t sure what you like so I got a regular a cappuccino and a Chai tea. Since you like Raj I thought you might be into that.
26183,Sheldon,That’s the one to beat. Leonard?
26184,Leonard,Hold on. So your idea is to get a van and cruise the streets looking for kids to pick up?
26185,Sheldon,Fine. Thank you for asking. I love you so much.
26186,Sheldon,I think we can safely assume that all Kryptonian condiments were destroyed when the planet Krypton exploded.
26187,Penny,Now is that a smart thing to say on a holiday that’s basically national sex night?
26188,Sheldon,All right. Hello.
26189,Leonard,Believe it or not he was worse when I met him.
26190,Howard,No.
26191,Penny,What do you mean every time you see her?
26192,Leonard,May what?
26193,Raj,That was before Penny. I make it a rule to only fall for one of my friends’ girlfriends at a time. I’m very old-fashioned that way.
26194,Leonard,They’re basically pure hydrocarbons soaked in fat. Let’s hope the lug nut expands.
26195,Raj,A little bird told us. Apparently you are a magnificent beast.
26196,Penny,You mean when he was little.
26197,Leonard,It’s never safe.
26198,Penny,All right fine pick another game. Amy and I will beat you at anything.
26199,Leonard,Fine. You walk up to the house knock on the door and demand your stuff back. What if he says no?
26200,Sheldon,Strongly pro.
26201,Leonard,What about when you did uh Anne Frank at that cute little theater?
26202,Sheldon,Just come with me.
26203,Howard,Why would I want her number? I don’t want anything to do with this woman.
26204,Raj,Okay.
26205,Leonard,Ah congratulations and may God have mercy on your soul. I’m Leonard. This is Raj.
26206,Leonard,How are you doing Stuart?
26207,Leonard,I’m the one who thought of it.
26208,Sheldon,Oh no no no well now there’s always the possibility that alcohol and poor judgement on her part might lead to a nice romantic evening.
26209,Penny,Just as challenging?
26210,Leonard,Here you go Copenhagen boy how about a taste of Hans Christian Hand Grenade.  Come on come on oh you clever little…. Come on come on take that!
26211,Penny,Sheldon a gift shouldn’t be something someone needs it should be something fun you know something they wouldn’t buy for themselves.
26212,Raj,You really think so?
26213,Penny,A proof that algebraic topology can never have a non self-contradictory set of abelion groups. I’m just a blonde monkey to you aren’t I?
26214,Leonard,Yeah. I got a dressmaker’s mannequin I stuffed it with an electric blanket so it would be warm and built two radio-controlled arms that would hug me and pat my back.
26215,Leonard,Because I don’t want it any more.
26216,Penny,Yeah.
26217,Penny,No what’s stupid is a physicist who doesn’t understand when you swing an axe you don’t let go.
26218,Sheldon,Have you notified NASA?
26219,Sheldon,Ooh I think she’s a fan of Garfield as well. Oh darn it now so am I.
26220,Howard,Oh Leonard you remind me of the funny old story about a man who walks into a women’s correctional institution with a stack of paperwork that will allow the female convicts to go free.
26221,Penny,Hey Sheldon.
26222,Sheldon,Wait where are you going?
26223,Leonard,Okay that’s all I got. Howard you’re up.
26224,Penny,I said get out.
26225,Sheldon,No no no no. We are done here. Would you mind opening the door and then angrily slamming it behind me?
26226,Raj,I don’t want to be a ninja I want to be a cat burglar.
26227,Sheldon,A date. You and me. Dining dancing perhaps you’d like to take in a prizefight.
26228,Penny,Okay what does all this have to do with the elevator?
26229,Sheldon,You’re clearly misremembering. Your mother is brilliant analytical insightful and I’m betting she never hit you with a Bible because you wouldn’t eat your Brussels sprouts.
26230,Leonard,That’s enough Sheldon.
26231,Howard,I’ll take one.
26232,Leonard,Okay now this is ridiculous!
26233,Penny,Squared?
26234,Leonard,Okay Sheldon I’m going to say why and your answer cannot be because I forgot my flash drive.
26235,Raj,Really? A robot hand’s got a death grip on your junk dude. That’s funny ask anyone.
26236,Sheldon,I’m not going to get my pecan pie am I?
26237,Sheldon,Told you.
26238,Leonard,Because of the reasons that Penny will now tell you. Penny?
26239,Leonard,No reason. Oh you know what maybe this isn’t such a good idea.
26240,Penny,No. Yeah I remember specifically. You started by asking if I was from Mars because my ass was out of this world.
26241,Penny,Uh I don’t think any of your comfort zones are showing.
26242,Penny,Ah du-du-du-du-du. How did they meet?
26243,Leonard,Um shut up.
26244,Penny,Uh not really a great outfit for work unless something opens up in the hookers and whores division. Hey can I ask you something?
26245,Raj,Stop it. You’re ruining girls’ night.
26246,Penny,Well which is it ten or eleven?
26247,Howard,Oh okay. I’ll just go home and be alone. Which is cool. I eat alone I sleep alone I cry alone so cool.
26248,Leonard,Hey how’s it going.
26249,Leonard,And you don’t think that’s too rough?
26250,Raj,I don’t know. Why do I own one?
26251,Sheldon,Get a load of this guy.
26252,Penny,Really? That that’s it? That’s comforting?
26253,Leonard,Hi. We’re from the university. We’re trying to get some information about Professor Abbott.
26255,Penny,Oh okay. Well I guess it’s just the two of us huh?
26256,Sheldon,Yeah well now well keep it short. From what I gather brevity is your friend. So are we good here?
26257,Leonard,What am I supposed to say? Sure Penny I’m cool with your old boyfriend sleeping in your apartment. Well Leonard it doesn’t matter if you’re cool or not because I’m Penny and I’m pretty and I can do whatever the hell I want! Oh I get it! You think you’re doing me a favour just by being in a relationship with me! No no Leonard! I’m doing you a favour just by being in the same room as you!
26258,Howard,Not really.
26259,Leonard,Oh yeah speaking of work do you know if you have Thursday night off?
26260,Raj,And a cow and a penguin. Face it dude whether it’s a real car or a virtual cartoon car you can’t drive.
26261,Leonard,Yeah. Shame he has to wake up.
26262,Leonard,Where do I sign?
26263,Sheldon,Oh this is a nightmare!
26264,Penny,Mm I think so. Dragons snow zombies and all the hot guys are dead.
26265,Leonard,Right.
26266,Penny,How did you know I was here?
26267,Raj,Would you stop writing? Wait so did all of you go on to better relationships after me?
26268,Leonard,I’m glad you’re enjoying yourself.
26269,Howard,Well there’s no toilets we’ll have to do our business in a bucket.
26270,Leonard,Right. Sorry.
26271,Raj,I… I don’t believe it this is a terrible betrayal of my trust.
26272,Sheldon,I would like to propose that the three of you accompany me.
26273,Sheldon,No no no no no no no…
26274,Howard,Would you look at this? I paid twenty five dollars to some kid on eBay for a handcrafted Harry Potter wand. He sent me a stick. He went into his backyard he picked up a stick.
26275,Penny,Sure. Just when you say dressed up you mean nice clothes right? Not like capes and tights and crap?
26276,Leonard,And in the darkness bind them.
26277,Sheldon,Oh no. Not that. I I understand the mechanics.
26279,Penny,I know but she’s kind of a bully.
26280,Sheldon,If it’s any consolation I’m not happy about it either. Good night.
26281,Penny,Um yeah starting with the champagne a little early aren’t you?
26282,Leonard,Okay.
26283,Leonard,Wow. That that’s a big step.
26284,Penny,Um Raj there’s someone I want you to meet. This is my friend Emily. I know her from my spin class. Raj relax. She can’t hear you. She’s deaf.
26285,Leonard,Mm I thought it’d be fun to show her my old stomping grounds. I even know the exact spot where they used to stomp me.
26286,Leonard,Oh the girls really did a nice job.
26287,Sheldon,My point.
26288,Penny,No come on tonight we are trying new things.
26289,Leonard,Okay we used to go out right?
26290,Penny,Sweetie I can buy my own stuff. I have a good job now.
26291,Raj,Prostitute.
26292,Sheldon,Oh yes they are. I mean what?
26293,Penny,And then Raj you bring the stuff across the hall and start setting up.
26294,Leonard,Sheldon Penny was our only hope.
26295,Raj,Thank you.
26296,Penny,Got it.
26297,Howard,Okay. That’s cool. I guess everybody’s involved in this project but me. So see ya.
26298,Leonard,I don’t look you know words don’t always have to mean things.
26299,Howard,Did you take a band aid off in front of him?
26300,Sheldon,How can you trust Wikipedia if they use between to refer to three parties?
26301,Leonard,That sounds fun. When’s it start?
26302,Sheldon,Did you offer him a hot beverage?
26303,Sheldon,That trophy is meaningless I forfeited therefore you did not win.
26304,Raj,But what if one of them asks me what I was up to the night before and I was with the other one? Then what do I lie?
26305,Leonard,All right here’s the deal. Sheldon is gone so the tree decorating rules are out the window.
26306,Leonard,God I had the most horrible night.
26308,Leonard,Those are movies.
26309,Sheldon,Everything I say is true. Now of course the dung beetle also enjoys eating faeces living in faeces and making little balls out of faeces so you know pick and choose which aspects of its lifestyle you want to embrace.
26310,Howard,It’s a piercing. So uh how many tattoos?
26311,Sheldon,See I remembered because if it looks like Kim it’s Kim if it looks kind of like Kim it’s Kourtney and if it looks nothing like Kim it’s Khloe.
26312,Penny,Why not? 
26314,Leonard,Should be it’s thirty dollars a pound.
26315,Sheldon,I was analysing our lie and I believe we’re in danger of Penny seeing through the ruse.
26316,Raj,Sitar music for her ringtone is not cool dude.
26317,Leonard,Look I know they have money. I don’t think it’s that much.
26318,Howard,It’s a human emotion Sheldon. Everyone gets jealous. I’m jealous of Leonard and Penny and Howard and Bernadette for being in such happy relationships.
26319,Leonard,I do too but there’s not.
26320,Sheldon,As you know lizards cold-blooded animals lack the ability to sense temperature. But they do move more sluggishly when it’s cold. So lizard weathermen would say things like bring a sweater it’s slow outside. I love my mind.
26321,Howard,Bruce Banner Reed Richards Sue Storm Stephen Strange Otto Octavius Silver Surfer Peter Parker oh and worst of all J. Jonah Jameson Jr.
26322,Leonard,Look you can trust us. We’re respected scientists.
26323,Penny,Oh terrific. High school quarterback against four mathletes.
26324,Penny,Oh. Oh. Thank you.
26325,Sheldon,Yeah really? You think those hippies in Washington and Oregon can stop them?
26326,Penny,Come on Howard. You hurt her feelings by not calling her all week. Plus I’ve kind of been talkin’ some smack about ya.
26327,Penny,Because I know how important it is to you that I’m having some success.
26328,Raj,And you’re afraid it’ll do a better job than you?
26329,Leonard,What is wrong with you? If I did that you’d bitch about it for weeks.
26330,Raj,So I’ve been trying to come up with a cute couple’s nickname for me and Emily. What do you like better? Emippali or Koothrapemily?
26331,Raj,I don’t want to speak for Leonard.
26332,Penny,No buts. You got to stop letting him boss you around.
26333,Penny,Okay the whole point of this is to loosen you up a little so I’m thinking you’ll play the role of your mother and I will bring life to Mr. Spock.
26334,Howard,Anyway I’m among a handful of scientists that have been asked to submit a design proposal for the message and its delivery system.
26335,Howard,A hog? You have a two cylinder scooter with a basket on the front.
26336,Leonard,I don’t believe it. Stuart’s putting the moves on Penny.
26337,Howard,Sheldon listen to me. I have a big decision to make and I’m scared.
26338,Penny,I can see that. What team did you get?
26339,Penny,Yeah well maybe we do.
26340,Penny,Sheldon? What are you doing?
26341,Leonard,Yes.
26342,Penny,It was spur of the moment.
26343,Raj,You told me you were going to have the talk with him.
26344,Penny,What?
26345,Leonard,Why would you open mine?
26346,Sheldon, Arthur. Door knocker. That’s TV money.
26347,Penny,Oh all right. S’u’up?
26348,Penny,It wasn’t cheap. It was free.
26349,Penny,Yeah I know. I’m a total bitch.
26350,Sheldon,So he’s using his money to attract a mate. Is that any different than me using my intelligence to attract Amy? Or Leonard using his power of grovelling to get Penny?
26351,Penny,Hi.
26352,Penny,No.
26353,Penny,Okay these are Uggs. These are Crocs. These are knockoff Manolo Blahniks.
26354,Howard,When did you take my blood?
26355,Leonard,Your birthday is December 2 you grew up on Perkins Street the last four digits of your social are 7 6-2 1 and the odds of me letting you forget this are zero.
26356,Raj,I was distracted. It’s weird seeing a member of the Night’s Watch with a kayak strapped to his car. Come on. Hi excuse me s sorry I I don’t mean to bother you but we’re just really big fans of Firefly. And Dr. Horrible.
26357,Penny,They all live in a house together.
26358,Raj,Okay uh anybody else? Huh? No? Okay it all comes down to me the best man. Ooh! This grasshopper is kicking my ass-hopper. Okay when I first came to this country I-I didn’t know how to behave or how to dress or what was cool I was pretty lonely. But then I met Howard and suddenly my life changed because we could be lonely together. This man became my whole world.
26359,Penny,Yep. Hey and maybe this time you don’t try and talk sports with the guys.
26360,Penny,Fine. I want to release butterflies.
26361,Penny,Oh I don’t know. Can I see them in another colour?
26362,Leonard,All we have to do is rig up a 3-D communication system.
26363,Leonard,You heard him no.
26364,Sheldon,I’ll walk you through it. The game is not called Words with Strangers. No it’s not even called Words with Acquaintances. It is called Words with…
26365,Penny,Oh hey and do yourself a favour all right? When Beverly gets here do not bring up last night. All right? As far as you’re concerned you don’t know anything you didn’t see anything. I want you just to play dumb.
26366,Penny,Maybe some of us should stop talking altogether.
26367,Leonard,Are you sure?
26368,Sheldon,You’re right. I guess I just have to make lemonade out of the two of you. He played! He played! Coop and Rolling Thunder are together again. He was okay with that nickname.
26369,Howard,Leviticus 113 “Only that which parteth the hoof and cheweth the cud among the beasts shall ye eat.”
26370,Leonard,Oh.
26371,Leonard,It’s probably not as bad as you think. Let’s take a look. Maybe we can find some corners to cut. Oh here’s something if you don’t have electricity then you probably don’t need cable. Just a suggestion. 170 dollars for acting classes?
26372,Sheldon,You’re talking about me. Very funny. Although I would enjoy drawing up a budget and forcing Raj to adhere to it without an ounce of compassion.
26373,Penny,Oh honey is your medication wearing off?  
26374,Leonard,There’s not? Gee cos it sure sounds like there should be.
26375,Penny,Excuse me?
26376,Raj,Dude I’m a single man. Saturday night is my party night.
26377,Penny,Okay I will think about it.
26378,Sheldon,I suppose that could be a legitimate concern in a relationship. Uh perhaps even a a red flag. And speaking of red flags check out this sexy number from the former Soviet Union. Hubba hubba.
26379,Sheldon,Bernadette?
26380,Sheldon,No no. I will never have another chance to have gelato with Stan Lee because opportunities to have gelato with Stan Lee come but once in a lifetime. The moving finger writes and having writ moves on!
26381,Leonard,Oh yeah.
26382,Sheldon,If you’ve got a problem basing a relationship on a contract I’d like to tell you about 13 plucky colonies that entered a relationship agreement called the U.S. Constitution. And it may not be cool to say so but I think that love affair is still pretty hot today.
26383,Howard,Couldn’t leave him one friend could you?
26384,Leonard,That’s a rude thing to say out loud.
26385,Leonard,It’s not boring at all. You see in higher order mathematics there are certain sets of equations that…
26386,Sheldon,In the prom department.
26387,Penny,All right that’s enough. 
26388,Leonard,And I promise after waiting four months fast is what you’re gonna get.
26389,Howard,I can never find the tiller. I got a book; it didn’t help.
26390,Sheldon,You know I’ve given the matter some thought and I think I’d be willing to be a house pet to a race of super-intelligent aliens.
26391,Sheldon,Because I’m not interested in getting published in Mad magazine. Zingers fly fast in the Thunderdome Barry.
26392,Penny,I guess.
26393,Leonard,Thanks.
26394,Penny,Oh well then good!
26395,Sheldon,Are you just getting home?
26396,Leonard,Some perfect couple. He won’t even share his food with her.
26397,Sheldon,Meemaw. I’m so happy to see you.
26398,Penny,All right fine don’t tell us.
26399,Raj,I know she’s so thoughtful.
26400,Sheldon,Oh and here’s a picture of me receiving my bachelor of science degree.
26401,Leonard,All right I really didn’t want to do this but… here.
26402,Leonard,Would you like a glass of wine?
26403,Raj,Hey we can say it. You can’t.
26404,Sheldon,It’s slowing down.
26405,Leonard,I I don’t understand. All you’ve done since you discovered this stupid element was complain. I was trying to make you happy.
26406,Raj,This is not over.
26407,Leonard,I was actually the one who noticed okay let’s just start.
26408,Penny,Oh say no say no say no say no.
26409,Sheldon,I’m making hydrogen sulphide and ammonia gas. Just a little experiment in pest control.
26410,Sheldon,Howard’s allergic to peanuts. How can I use that against him?
26411,Howard,Be careful.
26412,Leonard,Uh sure why not.
26413,Leonard,Alicia is an actress just like you.
26414,Penny,Hey is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower. Oh. Hi sorry. Hello!
26415,Penny,Oh I think I see our next stop.
26417,Howard,I haven’t bonded with it.
26418,Leonard,No. He wanted me to find out if you’d have a problem with him asking her out.
26419,Penny,Yes.
26420,Howard,You want a TUMS?
26421,Sheldon,Lipid residue. An anal autograph. A colon calling card if you will.
26422,Sheldon,It’s a game that I just invented in which the participants answer physics questions in remedial Spanish. Um ¿Dónde está el boson de Higgs?
26423,Leonard,Hey.
26424,Leonard,You know some people might say that it’s great that we’re trying to make things work long distance. They’d say things like love is stronger than the miles between you.
26425,Penny,Oh wow. I wish it was better.
26426,Sheldon,Y-you’re being ridiculous. Those are perfectly clean.
26427,Leonard,No come on in. Hurry.
26429,Leonard,It’s two a.m. What are you doing up?
26430,Penny,Oh yeah.
26431,Sheldon,Uh for the hundredth time I smelled kettle corn and couldn’t find the cart.
26432,Leonard,So if any of you are considering going into experimental physics my door is always open. Once again I’m sorry that the demonstration didn’t quite work out but now we know what happens when you accidentally spill peach Snapple into a helium neon laser. Short answer is… don’t. And now to tell you about the theoretical physics department is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Dr. Cooper?
26433,Howard,You know you you and I you and I have a lot in common.
26434,Penny,Aw how cute. Is this like a diary?
26435,Leonard,Okay.
26436,Sheldon,I’m confused. Was there some sort of peer review committee to determine which scientists would be included?
26437,Raj,Well I I thought about…
26438,Sheldon,But why? Other than you two fighting we’re having such a good time.
26439,Leonard,I’m sorry that really is how it works.
26440,Sheldon,No it’s not. I’ve got five more slides.
26441,Raj,I don’t put pepper on salads.
26442,Leonard,Oh true but think of how much you’ve accomplished. Who got him to stop Purelling his pocket change?
26443,Leonard,I guess.
26444,Sheldon,It’s a limited edition Green Lantern lantern. My friend is looking for someone to copulate with.
26445,Sheldon,Name calling that is perfect. Now when I get to this equation here really let me have it. You know? If it helps I’m not the sharpest dresser.
26446,Sheldon,Do I detect a hint of condescension?
26447,Penny,Why not?
26448,Sheldon,Lot of big talk from a man who can’t draw a chocolate chip cookie.
26449,Leonard,I’m in.
26450,Sheldon,Well how can you say that? Professor Proton’s the best.
26451,Penny,Oh. You could tell it to me.
26452,Howard,Hey don’t talk to her like that. She’s a lady.
26453,Raj,Well so? So you think Bernadette’s just gonna let you jet down to San Diego for five days and leave her alone?
26454,Leonard,Ladies?
26455,Sheldon,Although Amy’s already taken me out of my package and played with me.
26456,Penny,But I don’t know anything about pharmaceuticals.
26457,Raj,Okay murder suspects Leonard has found the time machine the killer must’ve used. You’re all inside it and we hurtle through the very fabric of time. And welcome to 20 years in the future. Hey you guys just time-travelled. Stop looking so bored.
26458,Leonard,Oh hey Dave. And Penny what a surprise.
26459,Sheldon,I don’t need to explain myself to you!
26460,Sheldon,Movies or video games? Or board game? Or trading card games? Or Lego’s? Or dress up? Or comic books? Or dramatic readings of novelizations? Yes to all!
26461,Sheldon,A functional MRI of my brain. I did Sudoku before they took it so I’d be ripped.
26462,Raj,You know you keep quoting Wrath of Khan but he was in next generation. It’s a totally different set of characters.
26463,Sheldon,Well I didn’t hear the phone ring.
26464,Sheldon,Let’s not call it a problem. Let’s call it an opportunity. To solve a serious problem.
26466,Howard,Then don’t do it.
26467,Leonard,You know what you’ve convinced me maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet.
26468,Howard,No not really.
26469,Penny,Oh sorry I’ve just I’ve heard it before.
26470,Leonard,Sheldon’s nervous about me leaving. Just keep an eye on him while I’m gone.
26471,Leonard,No. You always picked and it was always the same. An hour and a half of beach houses in the rain until the woman turns around and realizes love was here all along.
26472,Sheldon,You’re taking advantage of us? We clarified nomenclature together.
26473,Leonard,Oh that’s cool.
26474,Sheldon,Outdoor? Oh. I can RSVP no right now.
26475,Sheldon,Penny the labour force is a living organism that must be carefully nurtured. Any counterproductive grumbling must be skilfully headed off by management. Observe. Hey! Less talk more work!
26476,Sheldon,And you said you pressed record. Anyway please sit back relax and join us as we take our final lap as indicated by the waving of this racing flag. And of course white flags can also represent surrender the Stewards of Gondor and the Japanese Minamoto clan but I’m sure you remember that from episode sixty-two White Flags Who’s Wavin’ ‘Em and Why?
26477,Sheldon,Please tell the judge I’m ready to apologize.
26478,Penny,He’s very shy how do I make him feel more comfortable around me?
26479,Sheldon,Yes you’re fine as long as you have a buffer living with you to distract from your marital problems. It used to be me. Now it’s Raj and his attack Tribble. Anyway I’m sorry for everything. Oh and FYI if you cry while they’re fighting they’ll take you to McDonald’s.
26480,Raj,You always do this you know? You ditch me for a woman you don’t have a shot with.
26481,Penny,Well didn’t he do a lot of the work?
26482,Howard,Bye.
26483,Raj,You’re right. You realize what this means?
26485,Leonard,Just think this time tomorrow we’ll be in Geneva Switzerland for our first Valentine’s Day.
26486,Raj,Okay okay. Although many older women lead vibrant active…
26487,Leonard,Yeah.
26488,Leonard,Not too bad. Did you hear about Howard and Bernadette?
26489,Sheldon,Can we please change the subject?
26490,Leonard,So Penny’s a little messy.
26491,Leonard,Yeah uh you guys have to sign here and here. On Monday we’ll file for the annulment and this marriage will be over.
26492,Raj,That is so cool.
26493,Sheldon,You can’t. I’m the lead author.
26494,Sheldon,I don’t follow.
26495,Raj,Isabella.
26496,Howard,Engaging my olfactory sense helps make it real for me.
26497,Penny,Really?
26498,Leonard,No.
26499,Leonard,Still I’d like to know the details. His mother was human his father was Vulcan they couldn’t just conceive.
26500,Leonard,Sure. If the pigeon’s stoned or a trucker.
26501,Leonard,Since when?
26502,Leonard,Warriors unsheathe your weapons magic wielders raise your wands.
26503,Penny,Hey Raj.  Hey listen I don’t know if you heard about what happened last night with Leonard and Sheldon but I’m really upset about it I mean they just they let themselves into my place and then they cleaned it I mean can you even believe that? How weird is that?
26504,Penny,Aw. So handsome. Like James Bond.
26505,Penny,Leonard you’re looking for a way to sleep with both women and have everybody be happy about it.
26506,Sheldon,Well why should I leave this is my apartment too.
26507,Leonard,So you and Zack again huh?
26509,Sheldon,Drat. Is this your card?
26510,Sheldon,Ta-da!
26511,Sheldon,Cookies?
26512,Howard,Sixty seconds. This is not looking good.
26513,Penny,Maybe if you’re working on a tuna boat.
26514,Howard,Oh my God I just got it. Fun onions Funyuns. Hold on. Is that a wobble? Yes. That’s definitely a gravitational wobble.
26515,Leonard,Okay. Hey Howard any thoughts on where we should get dinner?
26516,Sheldon,I don’t like bearclaws.
26517,Leonard,Where are we going?
26518,Leonard,Sheldon it’s three o’clock in the morning.
26519,Leonard,Well maybe you can go at it from a different angle like um you see a glimmer of goodness in him and you only said what you said because you want to nurture it and make it shine.
26520,Leonard,Wow. Teasing the guys at the Apple store seems a little redundant now.
26521,Raj,Thanks for skipping the movie. I couldn’t sit in that theatre for two hours wondering about Emily and that guy.
26522,Raj,And about three hundred dollars worth of makeup so this thief could look like anyone right now.
26523,Leonard,Uh yeah I’d be… I’d be happy to Penny.  I feel really guilty.
26524,Sheldon,If I were not being careful your telling me to be careful would not make me careful.
26525,Sheldon,That’s a semantically null sentence.
26526,Raj,Really? What was I doing to your neck last night while you were playing X-Box?
26527,Leonard,I would hope so.
26528,Penny,I think I started to suspect it was a bad movie when I looked at the script and saw the title Serial Ape-ist 2 Monkey See Monkey Kill.
26529,Raj,Uh I’ve got time booked in the telescope room all weekend scanning for rogue planets. You’re more than welcome to join me.
26530,Penny,Oh it’s not bad. Kind of hungry.
26531,Sheldon,Thank you.
26532,Leonard,Well it’s Thai food night.
26533,Raj,Okay. If I make this shot in the trash can the probe will have arrived in perfect working order.
26534,Sheldon,That sounds rehearsed. We are not alone.
26535,Leonard,I turned on the heat in my car and some vomit came out so my levels right up there.
26537,Leonard,Oh Madame Curie.
26538,Leonard,No.
26539,Leonard,Papaya?
26540,Penny,Well and his fiancée will be there so you know if the conversation lags we can talk about their wedding.
26541,Sheldon,Fine. How about one of the most beguiling and influential couples of the 20th century? Hewlett and Packard. Dibs on Hewlett. What? You want to be Hewlett?
26542,Sheldon,Evolution has made women sensitive to high pitched noises while they sleep so that they’ll be roused by a crying baby. If you want to avoid waking her speak in a lower register.
26543,Howard,Oh my God that’s so generous.
26544,Raj,What did she say?
26545,Leonard,Where on earth did you get that from?
26546,Sheldon,Do so do so.
26548,Howard,Trailing badly Wolowitz needs a strike if he has any hopes of catching up with Sheldon Cooper who is dominating in the ninth frame with a career-best 68.
26549,Leonard,Hey. We’re about to buy tickets for Comic-Con.
26550,Howard,I’m sorry?
26551,Leonard,I think so.
26552,Sheldon,Physically yes but I’m upset because everyone’s mad at me for no good reason.
26554,Sheldon,Oh I’m working on my lesson plan for Wolowitz. He is going to be so lost. Look at this section over here. Even I don’t really understand it.
26555,Leonard,I’m out.
26556,Leonard,I guess I’ll see you.
26557,Leonard,Uh sorry Raj. Howard and I are going out to dinner with Penny and Bernadette.
26558,Sheldon,Ah touché.
26559,Sheldon,Leonard wait. Am I correct in assuming that your attempt to be accepted by Penny’s peers is based on your desire to ensure your continuing mating privileges with her?
26560,Leonard,I’ve been thinking about names I’m kind of torn between Einstein Newton and Sergeant Fuzzyboots.
26561,Penny,All right want some French toast?
26562,Sheldon,You.
26564,Sheldon,A little messy? The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy this is chaos. Excuse me explain to me an organisational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid. I’m just inferring that this is a couch because the evidence suggests the coffee table’s having a tiny garage sale.
26565,Sheldon,Yes.
26566,Leonard,I know. Just do it. There’s a big inspection coming up and I don’t want to lose my TV privileges.
26567,Sheldon,It would but you know how much I admire preparedness. How did you know we’d be in the living room?
26568,Sheldon,I know that’s why I shortened it.
26569,Sheldon,Yes see of the handful of women Leonard’s been involved with she’s the only one I have ever found tolerable.
26570,Penny,So if I move my horsey here isn’t that checkmate and I win?
26571,Raj,You don’t like Mouse Boy? How about uh uh Kid Vermin?
26572,Sheldon,Why are you getting annoyed?
26573,Penny,All right round one. Here.
26575,Penny,No I I really didn’t.
26576,Sheldon,Well if we accept your premise and also accept the highly improbable assumption that Penny is the only woman in the world for you then we can logically conclude that the result of blowing it would be that you end up a lonely bitter old man with no progeny. The image of any number of evil lighthouse keepers from Scooby Doo cartoons comes to mind.
26577,Penny,All right don’t worry. I talked to Leonard. He is gonna sit the guys down and set them straight.
26578,Leonard,I don’t need to see your presentation. This discussion is over!
26579,Leonard,Shouldn’t we talk to him? Have you learned nothing in six years?
26580,Sheldon,I so loathe you.
26581,Sheldon,No. Not only that it has shifted from clear to milky green.
26582,Sheldon,In a tall glass with a lime wedge.
26583,Sheldon,Well I can’t help it. That’s an involuntary twinkle.
26584,Leonard,Agreed what’s your point?
26585,Leonard,Stephanie Barnett is single.
26586,Penny,This old guy was choking on his food and I saved his life.
26587,Penny,Hey. Sorry I ditched you.
26588,Sheldon,If that changes let me know. And finally area rugs pro or con?
26589,Leonard,Boy you sure get your money’s worth out of these games.
26591,Penny,Look Leonard what goes on between me and Stuart is none of your business. So just leave it alone okay?
26592,Sheldon,I have insufficient data to proceed. Excuse me miss?
26593,Leonard,It just makes things seem small. It diminishes them.
26594,Leonard,That’s great I’m happy for you.
26595,Sheldon,But I still need to use the bathroom.
26596,Sheldon,And you want to rub my nose in the fact that my contributions are being overlooked again? I am the William Shatner of theoretical physics. All right I’ll play. What self-important preening fraud are they honouring this year?
26597,Raj,Oh no.
26598,Leonard,Um if you don’t have any other plans do you want to join us for Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?
26599,Sheldon,Excuse me but the problem is not solved. If your head had been accidentally amputated and we transplanted a dog’s head in its place would that be “problem solved”?
26600,Sheldon,Technically swashbuckler is a combination of two terms. Swash referring to the sound of the sword. Swash. And then buckler meaning a small shield which you don’t have.
26601,Sheldon,See if Raj is done with Pilates.
26602,Sheldon,You’re welcome. Now let’s get this over with.
26603,Leonard,No that shouldn’t be a problem Venus is up during the day. They’re probably just all staring at the sky.
26605,Sheldon,Okay I’ll tell you but you can’t tell Leonard.
26606,Sheldon,People can’t be in my bedroom.
26607,Leonard,That completely was a forward pass which they threw intentionally incomplete to avoid loss of yardage or to conserve time. I can’t believe they’re not being penalized with the loss of a down and by having to move the line of scrimmage back to the spot of the foul.
26608,Sheldon,BRAIN LESIONS!
26609,Penny,How long have you had this secret account?
26610,Leonard,Ah so like every other M. Night Shyamalan movie I’ve seen you spoil it in advance.
26611,Sheldon,His name isn’t Toby. Toby is an absurd name for a cricket.
26612,Sheldon,Yes I am. It’s Wednesday. Wednesday’s Halo night.</i>
26613,Sheldon,Yeah please Amy! It’s got lightsabres!
26614,Raj,No I kind of feel like being alone right now.
26615,Leonard,I don’t understand why we’re leaving so early for the movie.
26616,Penny,It’s the comic book store it’s the comic book store it’s the comic book store.
26617,Leonard,Smart. Take relationship advice from a man who spent last night braiding Raj’s hair.
26618,Sheldon,You brought me my comic books when I wasn’t feeling well. That that was thoughtful. And I was insensitive. I’m sorry.
26619,Raj,Actually I’m busy.
26620,Sheldon, Amy?
26621,Penny,No.
26622,Penny,Yeah but you two make such a cute couple. Like Burt and Ernie. You guys even teach me stuff about words and numbers.
26623,Leonard,And bring you home. So why don’t you pack up your stuff and we’ll head back.
26625,Penny,I’m implying that you’re a creature of habit and if something were to prevent you from doing your laundry on Saturday at 815 you might find it unpleasant.  Knuckle under my ass.
26626,Sheldon,Fine. Mock Parliamentary procedure. At least put it on mute.
26627,Penny,Letting him make me happy.
26628,Howard,I say you tell Alex your heart belongs to Penny I provide her a shoulder to cry on and then roughly half a year later I give it to her good.
26629,Penny,Oh no.
26630,Sheldon,I believe you.
26631,Sheldon,Well you could have set Newton’s gravitational constant to one. And ugh the whole thing reeks of blueberry. You know I can’t stand these scented markers.
26632,Raj,Boy it wasn’t this hard with Bon Jovi. I said you rock he said thanks man and that was that.
26633,Howard,Oh that would be a good way to go.
26634,Sheldon,Rock rock water fountain. I am not proud of this but I have been envious of your recent success.
26635,Sheldon,Perhaps you can think of this n a more positive light. In one day you’ve managed to do what it takes many couples decades to achieve.
26636,Raj,Well you eloped and we didn’t get a chance to throw you a bachelor party so there’s a van downstairs and we’re here to take you to a surprise location for the weekend.
26637,Raj,Oh who was that girl from our Starbucks?
26638,Leonard,What did Penny mean you’d make a cute couple?
26639,Leonard,Mmm you liked Professor Guyster’s wedding.
26641,Raj,Uh wasn’t there supposed to be a zombie?
26642,Sheldon,I forgive you. Let’s go home.
26643,Leonard,I think that’s our girl. One of us should go talk to her.
26644,Sheldon,Okay look I think that you have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble Telescope does of discovering at the centre of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight searching for a circuit breaker. Nevertheless I do feel obligated to point out to you that she did no reject you. You did not ask her out.
26645,Penny,Oh. Sorry. Didn’t know you made those. Hey listen what if we have a little mother-in-law daughter-in-law dinner tonight?
26646,Sheldon,Sarcasm?
26648,Leonard,What about “damsel in distress?”
26649,Sheldon,All I know is after the fight I went to Emily’s to smooth…
26650,Penny,No.
26651,Sheldon,I sure did. Oh my goodness. Well from Jabba’s head to ice cream with Darth Vader I’m having a heck of a ride. Yeah look clearly good things happen when I’m in charge. Now why don’t you boys step aside let me knock this project out?
26652,Raj,It was until I realized the screen had frozen. Still one of my top three dates of all time.
26653,Sheldon,If I was okay I would’ve said hello and not the much more ominous hello.
26654,Raj,Really? It’s okay if I listen with you?
26655,Penny,Yup.
26656,Sheldon,Are you saying that you will not stand beside me as I plead my case?
26657,Sheldon,Where exactly? Sheldon Square? Sheldon Towers? Sheldon Stadium home of the Fighting Sheldons?
26658,Raj,Oh please. I don’t remember the episode of Star Trek where the guy never goes to space and brags about it in a tuxedo store.
26659,Sheldon,Oh God. That I’ve heard on multiple occasions. In what universe is that lightly toasted? This has to be the worst day of my life. Good morning Leonard.
26660,Penny,It wasn’t a real proposal.
26662,Sheldon,I did.
26663,Sheldon,It ends with dinosaurs. I’m sorry if you think less of me.
26664,Sheldon,Sorry I’m late.
26665,Penny,Here. Try and go online.
26666,Howard,This is not over.
26667,Sheldon,I don’t know how that sentence could possibly confuse you but to elaborate I’m going to the Arctic Circle with Leonard Wolowitz and Koothrappali.
26668,Penny,Well yeah I guess.
26669,Leonard,Some sports bar. It’s like they never even heard of Quidditch. Do we really have to go?
26670,Sheldon,Excuse me I take care of him.
26671,Leonard,It wasn’t awkward. It wasn’t fun. Besides what’s the big deal we dated we stopped dating and now we’re both moving on.
26672,Raj,Oh no.
26673,Sheldon,Well what should I do?
26674,Sheldon,Really? That’s very unsettling.
26675,Penny,Hi you guys ready to order?
26676,Leonard,Can you believe there was a time when we would have needed an array of giant Cherenkov telescopes to detect cosmic particles? And here we are building our own multi-wire detector like a couple of badasses.
26677,Sheldon,Wait wait. Where’s my bag? My phone and my wallet are in my bag.
26678,Raj,Now I’m making sure the telescope’s camera is white-field balanced and wishing you had a colouring book.
26679,Leonard,See Howard’s just as good a dungeon master as I am.
26680,Sheldon,That depends. When I learn that I’m a robot will I be able to handle it?
26681,Penny,So is it serious do you like her?
26682,Howard,Hey while you decide who was better in bed big hot Zack or wheezy little Leonard? Neener neener.
26683,Sheldon,Wait. It was me. I opened your toy discovered it was broken and didn’t tell you.
26684,Leonard,That is not what I said. Look I think you’re really good. I truly do. But this is an incredibly hard thing that you’re shooting for. I mean the odds of anyone becoming a successful actor are like a million to one.
26685,Penny,All right well what do you think he wants?
26686,Sheldon,I know. I’m still learning to control it.
26687,Leonard,No he doesn’t.
26688,Leonard,No we can’t.
26689,Leonard,Wow.
26690,Leonard,Wait wait wait. You had surgery?
26691,Penny,Hi.
26692,Sheldon,Good night. Appendicitis. What a nervous Nelly.
26693,Leonard,Okay it’s on.
26694,Sheldon,Eh maybe it’s your voice. I’m gonna see if I can get James Earl Jones to do it in post.
26695,Howard,Of course. Mrs. Cooper. So nice to see you again.
26696,Penny,What can I say? I got my geek on boys.
26697,Howard,What does hit a reef mean?
26698,Sheldon,It’s certainly preferable to my plan.
26699,Raj,No not a thing.
26700,Sheldon,I’m attempting to communicate with you without my meaning becoming apparent to those around you. Let me try again. Have the indigenous fauna accepted you as one of their own? Nudge nudge wink wink.
26701,Sheldon,Yeah.
26702,Penny,Bat-signal? What are you some kind of nerd?
26703,Raj,Me.
26704,Raj,What are you talking about?
26705,Leonard,But I fired you.
26706,Raj,That’s great. I’m broken too.
26707,Penny,Hang on. I want to see if he gets the star.
26708,Leonard,None of this matters. I trust that Penny cares about me and nothing’s gonna happen with this guy.
26709,Penny,Van Halen. Alright Madonna was married to this Ridgemont High alum.  Oh my God Sean Penn!
26710,Sheldon,You’ve taken a great evolutionary leap by abandoning human interaction and allowing yourself to romantically bond with a soulless machine. Kudos.
26711,Penny,Yeah just move your stupid scooter before I pick it up and throw it in the dumpster.
26712,Leonard,What?
26713,Leonard,Just hang on.
26714,Penny,What up Moon Pie?
26715,Howard,Hey Stuart.
26716,Raj,It was just a suggestion.
26717,Sheldon,Amy.
26718,Sheldon,It’s not cool. It’s a childish trick designed to confuse and intrigue simpletons. How’d you do it?
26719,Sheldon,Could have beaten around the bush a little.
26720,Leonard,With a hologram? Nice. Hey do you see this?
26721,Penny,Look I’m sorry. I was drunk I was lonely I hated Zack. Can we just forget it ever happened?
26722,Howard,I’m so happy you asked me here and I hope we can hang out again sometime. You know as friends lovemaking partners whatever.
26723,Sheldon,Would you like to see my cats?
26724,Raj,Okay. How about that one.
26725,Leonard,I’ll bet he’s some loser who lives with his parents.
26726,Penny,Uh hey guys guys you will really appreciate this I read the best science joke on the internet. Alicia you won’t get it but it’s right up their alley. Anyway so this physicist goes into an ice cream parlour every week and orders an ice cream sundae for himself and then offers one to the empty stool sitting next to him. This goes on for a while until the owner finally asks him what he’s doing. The man says “well I’m a physicist and quantum mechanics teaches us that it is possible for the matter above this stool to spontaneously turn into a beautiful woman who might accept my offer and fall in love with me.” The owner then says “well lots of single beautiful women come in here every day why don’t you buy an ice cream for one of them and they might fall in love with you?” And the physicist says “yeah but what are the odds of that happening?”
26727,Howard,Just to help her with her screenplay.
26728,Penny,You don’t need to do that it’s okay.
26729,Leonard,Sheldon…
26730,Sheldon,And?
26731,Howard,I skipped spin class for this.
26732,Raj,I don’t want to hug you either. I was just feeling blue.
26733,Howard,I can’t get Emily’s night-stand to close.
26734,Howard,To a white guy born here no. If you are a brown guy whose name has a lot of syllables in it terrifying.
26735,Sheldon,Yes. And if there’s time take 12 pictures with us in seasonal clothing.
26736,Sheldon,That’s a good one. Dumbledore dies in that one. Yeah I know I didn’t see it coming either.
26737,Raj,Oh yeah I got that Evite. Ever since I saw Pretty in Pink I’ve wanted to go to an American prom. But then I saw Carrie and I did not want to go to an American prom. But then I saw Never Been Kissed and I’m back on the prom bandwagon. This prom thing’s been a real roller coaster.
26738,Leonard,Hey what are you and Bernadette doing for your first Valentine’s Day?
26740,Penny,So um was Leonard okay with you coming over?
26741,Leonard,Oh wow.
26742,Howard,Not yet this is fun. Ooh I know. I’d let her free my willy. Where you going?
26743,Raj,Certainly. I’d like to raise two points. Number one I think they are talking about penises. And number two these mimosas are kicking my little brown ass.
26744,Sheldon,I’m sorry. I just want you to get better as soon as possible. And with that goal in mind let me ask you a question. Do you believe in the placebo effect?
26745,Raj,Really? I thought they were out West someplace.
26746,Leonard,I’m pretty sure I never said that.
26747,Sheldon,Actually I’m paraphrasing. Having been raised in a Christian household I’m uncomfortable with the language he used. And to be honest I’m not entirely comfortable with cockamamie.
26748,Leonard,It’s broken.
26749,Sheldon,Yeah. I know. Turns out being sweet isn’t enough to keep a girl these days. I blame Madonna.
26750,Penny,Welcome to Long Island Tex.
26751,Leonard,It was the heat of the moment.
26752,Leonard,Check.
26753,Sheldon,Oh I did more than work out all the math. I wrote a paper.
26754,Leonard,Do what you want. We’re getting scalped tickets.
26755,Leonard,Yeah I feel pretty good about myself. You think we can outrun him?
26756,Leonard,Excuse me. When Frodo left the Shire to take the one ring to Mordor didn’t Samwise Pippin and Merry go with him?
26757,Raj,Nope. I guess the heart wants what the heart wants. Or in this case doesn’t I mean at all. What?
26758,Sheldon,I understand. Oh Shelly? A man’s here to take you away to the future! Be sure to pack clean underwear.”
26759,Sheldon,Good I had Cornish game hen.
26760,Penny,Hi.
26761,Penny,Wait you don’t want me to go?
26762,Sheldon,Under the terms of my roommate agreement with Leonard I’ve had unilateral control of the thermostat ever since the sweaty night of ’06.
26763,Penny,Wow you got a lot of money in there.
26764,Raj,With my luck hepatitis
26765,Sheldon,I know.
26766,Raj,It is. But once a year on the seventh day of the seventh month Vega cries so hard that all the magpies in the world fly up and create a bridge with their wings so the two lovers can be together for a single night of passion.
26767,Sheldon,Oh did I forget to tell you? That store went out of business years ago.
26768,Penny,I listen. I have no idea what it means but I listen. To friendship.
26769,Sheldon,Evidently.
26770,Penny,No I’m from Omaha.
26771,Sheldon,No I want to talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the back.
26772,Leonard,If you’re referring to the work of Benjamin Franklin he did not discover electricity he merely used a kite to determine that lightning consists of electricity. He also invented the Franklin stove bifocals and the flexible urinary catheter. Kites ho.
26773,Sheldon,I wonder why no-one else bid this is a classic piece of sci-fi movie memorabilia.
26774,Leonard,Well actually technically you did do it.
26775,Sheldon,I resent you saying we don’t have company.
26776,Howard,If you really want to clean up your karma go get my freakin’ latte.
26777,Leonard,You got it. If this sweater shuts you up I’m gonna make a fortune selling them to everyone we know. Now all I need to do is head down to the video store and return the DVD.
26778,Sheldon,Yes. Yes he did that is a perfectly satisfying and plausible explanation. Yeah let’s all be mad at Stuart.
26779,Sheldon,I don’t know. You’ll have to devise a scenario that plausibly explains my absence keeping in mind that the key to a good lie lies in the details.
26780,Sheldon,Yeah I agree the social sciences are largely hokum. But short of putting electrodes in your brain and monitoring your response to my companionship this is the best I can do.
26781,Sheldon,Nice motivational speech from the team captain.
26782,Leonard,Check.
26783,Raj,So what’s gonna happen next? Are you and Bernadette going to break up?
26785,Raj,Oh Howard it’s still our thing. Come with us we’ll we’ll get you a scalped ticket.
26786,Sheldon,You’re right. Monte’s gone. We’ll bury him in the morning. A simple ceremony. I’ll speak. Leonard you’ll play your cello.
26788,Penny,What the hell was that?
26789,Penny,Oh. Okay.
26790,Raj,She’s clearly having a working lunch and preferred to eat alone.
26791,Sheldon,I’m sorry. It’s the alcohol talking. Go on.
26792,Penny,No no Sheldon they just make a half-sandwich.
26793,Sheldon,Well it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting “How wasted am I?” which is met with an approving chorus of “Dude.”
26794,Penny,Yeah come on Raj.
26795,Leonard,Oh so I shouldn’t ask her how she feels about being a member of your harem?
26796,Leonard,Hang on. Okay here’s what we’re gonna do. Chess clock. We each get five minutes to talk about our problems. We’ll take turns. Each turn will consist of a statement and a helpful response from the friend. Begin.
26797,Sheldon,Yes yes you were busy you were surprised all very fascinating. Now where do we stand on the freezer?
26798,Sheldon,I assure you I am quite real and I’m having regular intercourse with your daughter.
26799,Howard,Well we’ll always have the night the heat went out.
26800,Leonard,No.
26801,Raj,Thanks. I love hockey.
26802,Penny,No.
26803,Leonard,Yeah.
26804,Howard,That depends. On any level do you think she’s hot?
26805,Leonard,When you left you weren’t sure whether or not you wanted to know what was in your dad’s letter so we came up with kind of a cool solution.
26806,Sheldon,I’ve been thinking about what happened and I hope this gift will make things better.
26807,Penny,No.
26808,Sheldon,Caca?
26809,Leonard,Six two inch dowels.
26811,Penny,Hey guys sorry you had to wait but we are swamped. What’s this?
26812,Leonard,My point is just because I couldn’t do it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t. And I’m proud of you.
26813,Penny,I gave him a new look. It’s cute huh?
26814,Penny,Actually I’ve only had the cheesecake. One more time. You know Leonard did not want to tell you we were dating.
26815,Penny,Hey look then forget about her let’s do it for us. We could keep it small and informal. This time we can invite our families.
26816,Leonard,Okay. I’ll let you get back to fixing your eggs.
26817,Sheldon,How exactly would one measure a sense of humour? A humourmometer?
26818,Howard,Although it was already under control.
26819,Leonard,Wait if you guys didn’t talk what did you… never mind stupid question.
26820,Leonard,Remember that when the new TV falls off the wall and crushes us both.
26821,Raj,Is there a window around here we don’t know about?
26822,Sheldon,That’s interesting. Leonard can’t process corn.
26823,Leonard,Oh like Halley’s comet.
26824,Penny,Okay this isn’t the place to have this conversation.
26825,Sheldon,No what’s sad is that you don’t know Adam West was TV’s Batman.
26826,Leonard,Oh cool I’ll be like a pointy-eared Paul Bunyan.
26827,Sheldon,Meeting meeting bo-beeting banana-fana fo-feeting fee-fi mo-meeting.
26828,Sheldon,All I’m looking for is an educated intelligent woman who shares my interests while retaining her own unique point of view. She should be kind patient and most important unable to imagine life without me by ten o’clock tonight.
26829,Penny,Oh sweetie if you’re gonna screw things up it’s gonna be while you’re here not while you’re away. No. I mean look you have to go. It sounds like an amazing opportunity. And I’m just basing that on how much I didn’t understand what you said about it.
26830,Sheldon,I tried to let go of anger and threw a rock into my foot.
26831,Leonard,A homo-habilus discovering his opposable thumbs says what?
26832,Sheldon,Your clothes?
26833,Sheldon,A little.
26834,Sheldon,Ugh!
26835,Leonard,Will you shut up?
26836,Leonard,You pick up a Y chromosome while you were there? You might be short one.
26837,Leonard,That must be him.
26838,Raj,Oh well that’s the best part.
26839,Sheldon,Yeah? Oh well was this guy Rick from Computer Solutions on Colorado?
26840,Sheldon,No. No my mum had to fly back to Texas to help my dad because the house had slipped off the cinderblocks again.
26841,Sheldon,Someone call George R. R. Martin this guy knows how to finish a story.
26842,Sheldon,How did we get in the car?
26843,Raj,I want a picture with Nathan Fillion.
26844,Raj,Oh come on we could share a pretzel and get sideways glances from racist old ladies.
26845,Leonard,Really? I don’t even notice any more.
26846,Penny,You trend setter.
26847,Sheldon,I’m glad to see you made it safely. How’s your hotel?
26848,Sheldon,It’s not what I want it’s what evolution wants. Human beings are primates. Primates have evolved to live in groups both for protection and support.
26849,Leonard,Yeah.
26850,Leonard,Sorry Officer.
26851,Penny,Well I’m sure the new people will be just as quiet.
26852,Leonard,Alright back to the game.
26854,Sheldon,I’m doing it. I’m doing it. I’m tall and I’m doing it.  Ah man.
26855,Penny,Soft kitty warm kitty little ball of fur. Happy kitty um…
26856,Sheldon,I suppose so. But if I get out of the line I’ll lose my spot.
26857,Raj,Huh. That is so strange. Human Resources wants to talk to me tomorrow.  Could you stop licking your ass for two minutes? I have a problem here.
26858,Sheldon,We seem to have different approaches here. I was going for helpful honesty. I have no idea what you’re doing.
26859,Leonard,Okay let me see if I understand this. You want me to convince my ex-girlfriend to go to a costume party with her new boyfriend just so we can win a stupid prize?
26860,Raj,Yeah we totally did.
26861,Leonard,What are you doing in there?
26862,Sheldon,This movie baffles me every time we watch it.
26863,Sheldon,Fire demon.
26864,Sheldon,You did.
26866,Raj,Dr Gablehouser.
26867,Howard,Problem Wil Wheaton?
26868,Leonard,Priya and I are both adults. We didn’t betray Raj.
26869,Howard,One Jewish lasagna two pound cakes that are about eight pounds each and one giant container of matzoh ball soup.
26870,Sheldon,The water level rose.
26871,Howard,She’s tired that was funny.
26873,Howard,Anyway Dad’s gonna be here in town so I won’t be able to do Christmas dinner this year.
26874,Leonard,Sorry. Whatever. It’s all good.
26875,Howard,Do uh Howard and Bernadette know? Or is it like a possum in the walls kind of thing?
26876,Sheldon,Vintage doesn’t even begin to describe what we have planned. Tonight we are playing the classic 1980 interactive text adventure Zork. It’s the buggy beta version.
26877,Sheldon,Oh Dr. and Mrs. Hofstadter lovely to see you this fine morning.
26878,Penny,Wait wait wait why does it say one-day rush? Since when do we offer a one-day rush?
26879,Penny,Ah.
26880,Sheldon,I believe she’s experiencing her menses.
26881,Leonard,In what universe is that a present?
26883,Sheldon,Oh! Worf nice! Too bad that’s a proper noun.
26884,Sheldon,Well then you shouldn’t have jingle bells on your boots.
26885,Sheldon,Very well.
26886,Leonard,Never been on this side of the table before. I feel powerful.
26887,Leonard,Well congrats and it’s nice you’re gonna be there for your sister.
26888,Leonard,Thanks.
26889,Penny,It’s Penny.
26890,Leonard,Okay I’m going to ask you one more time we did the work together lets present the paper together.
26891,Leonard,Man he’s going to be blindsided.
26892,Raj,Hey buddy. I’m going to be in people magazine.
26893,Penny,Well…
26894,Penny,No.
26895,Raj,What was all that about?
26896,Penny,Oh. I don’t know. I guess my school was a nice place. We didn’t really have bullies.
26897,Sheldon,Thank you.
26898,Raj,You did?
26899,Sheldon,Professor Proton hosted my favourite science show when I was a child. I never missed an episode. He demonstrated scientific principles using everyday objects.
26900,Penny,Uh Queen Penelope AFK. What?
26901,Howard,It could be a trans-Neptunian object.
26902,Howard,You know what would be great? Let’s do it like the old days.
26903,Sheldon,Tuesday night we played Klingon boggle until one in the morning.
26904,Raj,You mean like when a guy’s upset because his friend agreed to take a cooking class with him and then doesn’t show up because he’s doing a juice fast with his mother?
26905,Sheldon,If the surgery is successful the snoring is gone. And if you die during surgery the snoring is gone.
26906,Leonard,Anyway we followed the guy to this garage sale and they had the coolest stuff.
26907,Leonard,Oh that’s awful.
26908,Sheldon,I let you think we went alphabetically to spare you the humiliation of dealing with the fact that it was my idea. Not to put too fine a point on it but I was throwing you a bone. You’re welcome.
26909,Howard,Well I didn’t get to see you last night. It was the least I could do.
26910,Penny,Oh this is very embarrassing. Dr. Lorvis I am so sorry. I did not mean to lead you on.
26911,Penny,Okay sweetie I understand you have scars that no non-professional can heal but nevertheless we are going to throw Leonard a birthday party.
26913,Penny,Well I don’t know what else we can do but tell them the truth.
26914,Sheldon,I was being sarcastic.
26915,Raj,It’s gross but I have to eat it because I met somebody.
26916,Howard,Hang on.
26917,Leonard,We are not blackmailing Peter J… All right where’s the ring?
26918,Penny,Because I’m stupid!
26919,Sheldon,Why is everybody keep telling me what time it is?
26920,Raj,Yeah. Like when you took Sheldon to Texas and showed him all around NASA you didn’t even think to ask me and Leonard.
26921,Penny,Umyeah yeah that sounds great let me just get my jacket.
26922,Howard,Feel better now?
26923,Penny,Oh that’s nice. Anyhow the thing I wanted to talk to you about is you know since Leonard and I have become friends I was just… want to sit down?
26924,Sheldon,I’d say wise beyond your years but you’re getting up there.
26925,Leonard,No it’s not. Always made it worse.
26926,Penny,Thanks. Are you ready?
26927,Leonard,Oh man I’m sorry that must have been devastating for you.
26928,Penny,Raj it’s Penny. Are you in there?
26929,Howard,May I join you?
26930,Howard,It’s like the best one they make I just can’t get it to work.
26931,Sheldon,This is my spot. Where else am I supposed to crouch?
26932,Leonard,Thank you.
26933,Leonard,Sure. You’re living here for free I guess I owe you.
26934,Penny,What are you gonna do?
26935,Leonard,Just eat.
26936,Penny,How else was I supposed to say it?
26937,Leonard,No I assumed it would be good. Then I read it.
26938,Penny,Okay look you promised me you would keep my secret so you’re just going to have to figure out a way to do it.
26939,Leonard,Mm I don’t know. Who here has ever been hurt because they were the teacher’s pet?
26940,Leonard,Sure when is scary not good? But okay um I have feelings right?
26941,Raj,Um well in my defence I tell everybody.
26942,Howard,Yes.
26943,Howard,Oh. All right.
26944,Penny,Sweetie that’s a highlight from the ’98 championship game.
26945,Sheldon,It won’t work the flower’s too porous.
26946,Leonard,Lesley? No no-oh what are you kidding?
26947,Penny,What is your problem?
26948,Penny,Hi.
26949,Howard,What is it?
26950,Raj,Aha. I see what’s going on here. You and I had our crazy night together and now you can’t stand to see me with another woman.
26951,Raj,It’s not like that I’m watching someone’s TV. The Good Wife is on. I tell you this is my new Grey’s Anatomy.
26952,Penny,You know for an extra four bucks I can have this thing here tomorrow.
26953,Leonard,Comforting you?
26954,Leonard,Do we really have to wear this camouflage crap to play paintball?
26955,Leonard,Well the G stands for graphics. That’s a hard G so I’d say gif.
26956,Sheldon,When I signed for the package I was deputized by the United Parcel Service and entrusted with its final delivery. I now need you to acknowledge receipt of the package so that I’m fully indemnified and no longer liable.
26957,Raj,I’m sorry. Go on.
26958,Sheldon,The thing is we’re not….
26959,Sheldon,All right goodbye.
26960,Sheldon,My friend Wil Wheaton.
26961,Howard,And doesn’t require outside machinery to be built to access it.
26962,Sheldon,And I will continue to do so!
26963,Raj,You better be. No jokes about how close I am with my dog. Or the truth about how close I am with my dog.
26964,Leonard,Uh that’s my water.
26965,Sheldon,Well I suppose it’s appropriate.
26966,Leonard,Yeah because I have something weird to tell her.
26967,Sheldon,And male partners. Animal partners. Large primordial eggplants pretty much whatever tickled his fancy.
26968,Sheldon,The the revisions I made start on page four.
26969,Penny,No please. Don’t stop go on. Tell me how I’m gonna be a waitress for the rest of my life.
26970,Leonard,Thanks Mom.
26972,Penny,Are you guys having problems?
26973,Raj,Well I want to make sure we get invited to all the parades.
26974,Sheldon,Penny.
26975,Sheldon,Violation of the roommate agreement overnight guest notification clause.
26976,Penny,More or less.
26977,Howard,Well it’s kind of hard to tell.
26978,Penny,Yeah that’s right.
26979,Raj,What do you think we should sell it for?
26980,Leonard,You could be a little more into it.
26981,Sheldon,No you most certainly are not.
26982,Leonard,Oh the pleasure is mine Mr. Innovative. Uh another one says the concept shows some real out-of-the-box thinking. Do you hear that Mr. Out-Of-The?
26983,Sheldon,I didn’t say the snacks were for you now did I Nosy Rosie?
26984,Raj,Well I should warn you it’s just looking at data for hours and hours on a computer screen.
26985,Leonard,I don’t know why I avoided the Harry Potter books for so long. These are great. I just started number six.
26986,Penny,Yeah yeah it’s good to see you too. We should really go.
26987,Sheldon,Boy that does smell good. Too bad it’s Monday.
26988,Penny,All right what about music?
26989,Leonard,Thanks. Hey do you want to I don’t know later…
26990,Howard,Stuart? Are you okay?
26991,Leonard,Thanks again for having us.
26992,Leonard,I’m fine.
26993,Sheldon,You mess with the bull you get the horns. I’m about to show this guy just how horny I can be.
26994,Leonard,You’re taking him to Disneyland?
26995,Penny,Yogurt?
26996,Leonard,Oh if you if you like banana bread I’ve got a-a great recipe. The trick is in in fresh ground I’ll e-mail it to you.
26997,Leonard,I’ll see you later. I gotta go watch a stupid football game with Penny.
26998,Sheldon,Would you like to see pictures from my trip?
26999,Raj,A second trip to space I’ll miss you.
27000,Leonard,Oh God no. The money’s pretty good. And I used the equipment to make my own Bat-signal.
27001,Leonard,This is fun huh?
27002,Raj,I don’t know.
27003,Sheldon,Oh that was my sixth trip to the bathroom. As long as that’s not a urinary tract infection that’s a personal best.
27004,Raj,Howard that’s not how we practiced it.
27005,Sheldon,Yeah only after I eliminated all the obvious answers. You’re welcome.
27006,Raj,Well it’s it’s possible it was tracking everywhere you went.
27007,Sheldon,A hush falls over the crowd as Cooper studies the board. He makes his move. He’s dividing both sides by I. He’s adding back the coefficient. He has a value for P. He’s plugging that back in. He takes the derivative and he solves the equation. The crowd goes wild. Nobel! Nobel!
27008,Sheldon,Oh don’t thank me. Thank wireless technology. I realized I can go to your aunt’s awful party and still spend the whole day gaming with my friends.
27009,Leonard,No it’s pretty well imprinted on my brain. Especially the whole rodeo thing.
27010,Sheldon,Well see why can’t Amy be that subservient? She has coitus one time suddenly she’s Gloria Steinem. Anyway I suppose an ice cream parlour will be a good place to meet other women.
27011,Sheldon,You know it’s like how I play Warlords of Ka’a with you and Elder Sign with Frank and Alicia.
27012,Sheldon,What sight is better than your little boy embarrassing a Nobel laureate?
27013,Howard,I would love to see your collection.
27014,Sheldon,I refuse to sink to his level.
27015,Raj,Did you guys see the new budget memo that went out this morning?
27016,Sheldon,Penny you’re an expert on trading sexual favours for material gain walk him through this.
27017,Sheldon,That’s a good point. You know I’m a lot like Gandalf the Grey. He fought the Balrog and emerged stronger than ever as Gandalf the White. I was robbed of my phone and pants and I too came back stronger. And whiter too ’cause I wasn’t in direct sunlight for six weeks.
27019,Penny,Oh I can’t wait for you to meet everyone. I told them all about you.
27020,Leonard,Not the right seats. 
27021,Sheldon,Okay. You know I heard in the news a bobcat has been spotted in her neighbourhood.
27022,Howard,One.
27023,Sheldon,You want to play Jenga? Or uh Ticket to Ride? Hearthstone? What would you be the happiest losing at?
27024,Sheldon,We’re the Justice League of America. There’s only one thing we can do. Turn around and slowly walk away.
27025,Leonard,We’re trying to get past a security guard not rescue Zelda.
27026,Sheldon,But she’s got Google Maps on her phone.
27027,Penny,That’s thinking ahead.
27028,Sheldon,No the Flash shirt is because it’s Friday but it’s nice when things work out. Where’s your heart rate monitor?
27029,Leonard,Yes.
27030,Leonard,Okay how about this? Let me tell you about the first time I brought a girl over. 
27031,Raj,If it’s okay with you I’d like to go to temple.
27032,Howard,Welcome.
27033,Sheldon,Sorry I didn’t mean to offend you. Obviously you’re not that familiar with Indian cinema.
27034,Sheldon,No no no no no no. Let me start again. In 1935 Erwin Schrodinger…
27035,Raj,This is fun. I’ve never used a hydraulic thermoforming press before.
27036,Leonard,I don’t think I’ve lit a real fire before.
27037,Penny,Um.
27038,Leonard,And when we go in there let’s show Raj that we’re happy for him.
27039,Raj,I’ll tell you where it’s coming from. All you do is make fun of me for coming to girls’ night and now you’re here ruining it for everyone.
27040,Leonard,Uh yeah. I guess.
27041,Leonard,Yeah maybe. Meanwhile back in the 21st century people are raising their tray tables and putting their seat-backs in an upright position ’cause it’s time to land in San Francisco.
27042,Howard,I’m trapped. My clothes have been in the laundry all day and she hid my keys. I think they might be in her bra because she jingles when she walks. What do I do?
27043,Penny,So where should we go tonight? A bar? A club? A movie?
27044,Howard,Do you think I have a shot with Penny?
27045,Sheldon,I’m starting to rethink the Flash onesie I bought this kid.
27046,Sheldon,60 only takes me to here. I need to get to here.
27047,Sheldon,I assume the skills can be extrapolated and transferred.
27048,Sheldon,As do I.
27049,Howard,Okay that sounds good.
27050,Leonard,Lobster traps?
27051,Penny,I can’t believe it. All this time I’ve been doing nothing but sit around and miss that guy. And you know what the worst part is?
27052,Raj,Sheldon can suck on the Casimir Effect.
27053,Sheldon,Yeah but now wait. Do whatever I want? Or whatever I have to want?
27055,Howard,To friendship.
27056,Penny,Wait wait Sheldon come back you forgot something.
27057,Penny,Uh yeah I wouldn’t say many. A few. 
27058,Sheldon,You betrayed me Wil Wheaton. Now I have my revenge.
27059,Leonard,Apparently.
27060,Raj,Did that feel good? You feel like a big man now?
27061,Raj,And then some. I think we had a moment.
27062,Leonard,I promise this is the last time.
27063,Leonard,Good luck.
27064,Howard,Okay I guess.
27065,Raj,I have come to an important decision. I will not be accepting your money any more. I’m a man and I can take care of myself.
27066,Sheldon,No you really shouldn’t have. I brought my own.
27067,Sheldon,Given the state of your career can you really afford to be picky?
27068,Leonard,Hey Amy what brings you to our neck of the woods?
27069,Howard,What else are you gonna do with it? Put it in your coffee?
27070,Howard,Yeah I get that. I’m a scientist slash party planner slash small-dog enthusiast slash guy who probably should have stopped at scientist.
27071,Sheldon,Leonard. Check it out. I bought an N-gauge locomotive. Half the size of H-O. Look it fits in my mouth.
27072,Leonard,Hey.
27073,Raj,Okay yeah that’s pretty good.
27074,Penny,Boy I love him but he is one serious wackadoodle.
27075,Raj,Don’t call her my girlfriend. We haven’t discussed whether or not we’re girlfriend or boyfriend yet. Now that it’s out there are you my girlfriend? By the way if you say no I’ll never be happy again. Not to put you on the spot.
27076,Penny,You know Beverly I know you and Alfred have your differences but if you think about it if you hadn’t married him there’d be no Leonard. So that’s good right?
27077,Sheldon,He’s putting his needs ahead of the collective good.  Where he comes from that’s punishable by death.
27078,Leonard,You said always. You’ll always have feelings for me.
27079,Sheldon,What reference?
27080,Leonard,Hi. Hey Raj will you be joining us for dinner?
27081,Sheldon,People people please before you say something you both regret I’d like to place my order.
27082,Leonard,Yeah.
27083,Sheldon,Well we don’t have a dolly or lifting belts or any measurable upper body strength.
27084,Howard,You know me. I’m from India. I can’t resist children begging. So how’s it going with the title to the house?
27086,Leonard,You guys suck.  Come on please? He’s so big.
27087,Sheldon,I don’t understand the question.
27088,Leonard,Yes.
27089,Leonard,I don’t know. Olivia Geiger?
27090,Penny,All right come on Sheldon.
27091,Leonard,No no it’s fine. I don’t care. I’m over it.
27092,Penny,Oh no it is but I decided instead of complaining about it I’m just gonna go in every day and give it my all.
27093,Sheldon,Leonard moves the meeting not occur. Is there a second? None heard the motion fails. I’d like to begin the meeting by congratulating you on the progress in your relationship with Dr. Stephanie.
27094,Sheldon,Well that speaks volumes doesn’t it? All right I suppose I’ll go put on my bus pants.
27095,Sheldon,I believe the back-scratching metaphor generally describes a quid pro quo situation where one party provides goods or services to the second party in compensation for a similar action.
27096,Leonard,Mm the guys and I were thinking about investing in Stuart’s comic book store. Is that okay?
27097,Sheldon,Let’s make that our word of the day.
27098,Raj,What?
27099,Leonard,Thank you!
27100,Leonard,That is so great. Oh I’m Leonard I live downstairs. Upstairs from here but under you. Not under you per se but under your apartment.
27101,Penny,Okay.
27102,Penny,Okay I’m not upset about Leonard and Priya.
27103,Sheldon,I read a study online that walking after a meal not only aids in digestion but increases serotonin and you know me if there’s one thing I like more than a refreshing beverage it’s serotonin. Bye-bye.
27104,Raj,Uh-huh.
27105,Penny,Oh I love San Francisco. I wish I was going with you.
27106,Leonard,How much have you had to drink tonight?
27107,Leonard,Hey I am every bit as much of a man as Penny. Now let’s do this.
27108,Penny,Let’s go.
27109,Leonard,You’re sure it’s good?
27110,Penny,Ugh I need some air.
27112,Penny,Relax.
27113,Leonard,Why not?
27114,Leonard,A little mood lighting huh?
27115,Leonard,Hold on you actually want me to deceive your father with some sort of sham play acting and kissing? Cause I’m good with that.
27116,Leonard,Lots of people also didn’t have that idea like everyone in the entire world except for me.
27117,Sheldon,The conductor and I have the same pocket watch.
27118,Raj,Come on I just told you I had a girlfriend. The least you can do is tell me if we had a vibe.
27119,Penny,That’s nice.
27120,Leonard,How am I looking now?
27121,Leonard,I’ve seen him do it. It’s not romantic.
27122,Sheldon,Um…
27123,Leonard,No I mean just you and me.
27124,Leonard,Uh went splitsville.
27125,Raj,It turns out he doesn’t care if I’m married or if I’m single. He’s basically given up on me.
27126,Leonard,Oh sure what’s up?
27127,Raj,I’m not being a child. Leonard I swear to God if your sister ever comes to town I shall have my way with her.
27128,Penny,Okay you’re right I eat your food a lot. How about this you can raid my fridge any time you want.
27129,Penny,We are really sorry and we were trying to think of some way to show you how much we care about you.
27130,Leonard,Bernadette wants to get a pre-nup.
27131,Raj,But I need to earn enough money so I can go to Comic-Con.
27132,Penny,Some wine.
27133,Sheldon,It’s Halo night.
27134,Leonard,I’m sorry I’m-I’m still trying to work on the defecating Clark Maxwell so…
27135,Raj,Yeah well I love her.
27136,Howard,I’m sorry. What did you want to say?
27137,Penny,Mm-hmm?
27138,Raj,Back off Sheldon.
27139,Raj,Yeah okay.
27140,Howard,I don’t want to be a ninja I want to be a cat burglar.
27141,Howard,Oh. Well then I anticipate an awkward situation when you get home.
27142,Penny,No I’m not embarrassed. I just didn’t want anyone to know because I haven’t told Leonard yet.
27143,Sheldon,You can’t leave. I need you.
27144,Raj,What about that little cup they give you?
27145,Sheldon,Yeah that too. Big cheque.
27146,Sheldon,So your mirth is merely a discharge of nervous energy with no semantic content at all?
27147,Raj,My name is Little Orphan Annie. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
27149,Raj,Thank you. I appreciate that.
27150,Penny,So how you been?
27151,Leonard,Yeah you got me. I’m a Leibniz man.
27152,Howard,But what if one of them asks me what I was up to the night before and I was with the other one? Then what do I lie?
27153,Leonard,Okay.
27154,Howard,Oh I’m sorry. I’ll leave.
27155,Sheldon,Ah so the yogurt didn’t work. I’ll fire off a critical e-mail to the manufacturer.
27156,Penny,What?
27157,Leonard,Mmm in my family holidays weren’t so much celebrated as studied for their anthropological and psychological implications on human society.
27158,Penny,I do and you know I don’t think I’ve ever thanked you properly for helping me get it.
27159,Leonard,Do you guys remember Penny’s ex-boyfriend Kurt?  Yeah that’s him. It turns out he owes Penny a lot of money and I’m gonna go get it from him.
27160,Raj,Do it.
27161,Penny,Once again unbelievable.
27162,Sheldon,A little crush? Well I suppose so in the same way Menelaus had a little crush on Helen of Troy.
27163,Sheldon,I envy you your childhood.
27164,Sheldon,And now we’re going to turn it over to you the viewers to call in and share your favourite Fun with Flags moments.
27165,Leonard,No.
27166,Penny,That’s it. That wasn’t so bad.
27167,Sheldon,How could you not find him?
27168,Penny,Nicely done.
27169,Sheldon,Here goes nothing? This is the initial test of our prototype. Can we give it a little more gravitas?
27170,Sheldon,You have a keen insight into the human heart Amy Farrah Fowler.
27171,Penny,Nope. 
27172,Penny,I know but we’ve finally gotten to a place where we can hang out without it being weird. And what if something goes wrong? Then what?
27173,Raj,But you’re not alone anymore. Now you’ve got Sheldon.
27174,Leonard,I don’t know. It’s all such a blur.
27175,Sheldon,In what I can only perceive as a tactical move to destroy me he is with Wolowitz and Koothrappali setting up her stereo.
27176,Leonard,What’s the big deal?
27177,Leonard,I just thought of one more.
27178,Sheldon,Do you know what else I love about you?
27179,Sheldon,Yes. According to information I gleaned from Yelp you had great success when a santeriasuzy37 brought you a pair of leather slacks stained with chicken blood. I believe I may have a similar problem. This cushion experienced a nude revenge wiggle.
27180,Howard,I got a colossal serpent right here.
27181,Leonard,I didn’t say Raj. Who said Raj?
27182,Sheldon,Mmm great news Leonard I’ve solved my Penny gift dilemma.
27183,Sheldon,I can’t believe you almost had me bring a wild animal into my home.
27184,Sheldon,Why?
27185,Leonard,What?
27186,Leonard,Oh my God. That’s Kripke’s robot?
27187,Penny,Yeah?
27188,Penny,No we were just wondering why the guys like this stuff so much so we thought we’d give it a try.
27189,Howard,Oh boy Sheldon’s going to freak out.
27190,Penny,Since always. Call me a geek but I am just nuts for the whole subatomic particle thing.
27191,Penny,No.
27192,Raj,I’m really disappointed we’re not gonna have our own comic book store.
27193,Sheldon,Tell him yourself.
27194,Penny,Are you okay?
27195,Leonard,Hang on. They’re showing a new digital print of Time Bandits you wouldn’t want to come would you?
27196,Sheldon,I thought you broke up with her. Why is she here?
27197,Sheldon,Oh wait. No. How about we split the difference and discuss why Austria was an archduchy and not just a regular duchy.
27198,Howard,Dude you made the right choice coming to me for help with this party.
27199,Howard,Ha! Eat my dust racially stereotypical plumber.
27200,Leonard,And are you gonna use candy to lure them in?
27201,Leonard,That’s so sweet you think I have self-esteem.
27202,Raj,Excuse me. I’m here to pay my respects to Professor Tupperware or whatever his name is.
27203,Raj,You heard that Ladies’ Night ladies? We’re eventually coming for you!
27204,Leonard,Probably ’cause you got to see your man up there rockin’ the mic.
27205,Sheldon,Oh absolutely. I have a contractual obligation to provide Amy with conversation and casual physical contact but nowhere is it specified that I can’t outsource that to an Indian.
27206,Penny,Okay great. What is it?
27207,Penny,Well?
27208,Sheldon,What does that mean?
27209,Howard,Mmm gentlemen I put it to you the worst tapioca pudding is better than the best pudding of any other flavour.
27210,Leonard,That’s a good question. Maybe just don’t come over.
27211,Penny,Really? I mean are you sure?
27212,Sheldon,Oh.
27213,Howard,Don’t be like that. Come on Howard talk to him.
27214,Penny,What do you mean not exactly?
27215,Sheldon,I don’t care. There are far too many historical anomalies for my comfort.
27216,Howard,Yes but she doesn’t. So get signing hand monkey.
27217,Raj,The… the picture’s breaking up.
27218,Sheldon,That’s very hurtful.
27220,Sheldon,Yeah I never cared for that. It’s advertising to predator races just how soft and squishy we are.
27221,Sheldon,Uh-oh.
27222,Leonard,I heard about this professor at MIT who melted down bought a van and spent the rest of his life as a mobile dog groomer.
27223,Raj,It looks like a map from Dungeons and Dragons.
27224,Howard,You know but but they’re very firm so you’ve got that going for you.
27225,Howard,Look I’m sorry you’re upset with me but I just have to say it’s nice to see the two of you on the same page.
27226,Howard,Yes?
27227,Sheldon,There are takeout containers in the trash can.
27228,Leonard,Then why did I have to crawl?
27229,Penny,What?
27230,Penny,Oh great.
27231,Leonard,Right. Uh yeah funny. Uh that device there will measure the photons that return and let us see it on this computer. Raj get them some glasses.
27232,Raj,Okay look I’m on the Air Force Web site and the department that e-mailed you is in charge of acquisitions. So maybe they just want to give you a lot of money for your invention.
27233,Howard,Oh uh hi Penny. Yes please.
27234,Sheldon,The two of you need to get your women in line!
27235,Penny,It’s not working.
27236,Leonard,Nice try. I’m not going.
27237,Sheldon,Oh I’m so sorry for your loss. On a cheerier note I have a teeth-cleaning appointment this afternoon. What do you say you take me over there buddy boy?
27238,Leonard,Empathetic.
27239,Sheldon,Perfect that gives you two hours and fifteen minutes for that dense molecular cloud of Aramis to dissipate.
27240,Sheldon,Have you gotten Leonard a welcome-home gift yet?
27241,Sheldon,You act like I didn’t get you that mushroom log on Valentine’s Day.
27242,Leonard,He lives in the same room where his bassinet was.
27243,Sheldon,Okay.
27244,Sheldon,I’d imagine you heard any number of things today. When you arrived at work you undoubtedly heard hello Raj how are you Raj? Given that you’re wearing a new sweater-vest you may have heard new sweater-vest? And possibly though far less likely nice sweater-vest.
27245,Sheldon,Wonder what she’s exasperated about. Hello?
27246,Howard,Answer it.
27247,Sheldon,Leonard I have something to tell you but I want you to promise not to flip out.
27248,Leonard,Oh I took care of it.
27249,Penny,Oh hey Amy. Bernadette just texted me. Howard proposed?
27250,Leonard,Well Howard I don’t know much about women.
27251,Raj,So couldn’t help but notice none of you RSVP’d to my murder mystery dinner party.
27252,Sheldon,That’s 4.9 Penny Blossoms per hour. Based on your cost of materials and your wholesale selling price you’ll effectively be paying yourself… $5.19 a day.
27253,Howard,A prostitute yes.
27254,Penny,Hey boys. How’s it going?
27255,Penny,Control issues?
27256,Leonard,At least he’s off the train crap.
27257,Sheldon,Age is a state of mind Leonard. In here I’m 90. Why are you taking your bins over there?
27258,Sheldon,What’d you get? What’d you get?
27259,Sheldon,Hmm. What are you doing now?
27260,Raj,All right. More Sailor Moon for me.
27261,Howard,We would have been the angry green belles of the masquerade ball.
27262,Penny,Well imagine how I’m feeling.
27263,Howard,It doesn’t have an oh in front of it.
27264,Sheldon,Me too. I got a lot of TV to catch up on.
27265,Leonard,Yeah Stephanie got it for me. It’s kind of fun.
27266,Leonard,Morning.
27267,Raj,Did you forget what Penny did to you? It took you two years and defiling my sister to turn that frown upside down.
27268,Raj,12 minutes.
27269,Leonard,I don’t think so.
27271,Sheldon,Mommy why are you crying? ‘Cause I’m gonna miss you Shelly-bean even though you creep the bejeezus out of me.
27272,Sheldon,Come in. Take a seat. Subject has arrived. I’ve extended a friendly casual greeting.
27273,Penny,Oh sounds festive. Did you at least give presents?
27274,Penny,Sorry. She’s taken too.
27275,Penny,Morning Sheldon. Come dance with me.
27276,Raj,I’m telling you if xenon emits ultraviolet light then those dark matter discoveries must be wrong.
27277,Leonard,It would be a replica of a movie prop.
27278,Sheldon,You’re the ones who are going to get in trouble. You’re buying non-transferable tickets. And from a stranger no less. Not only can you get banned from Comic-Con if caught you could be charged with petty theft. You think about that while I’m warning James Earl Jones about the danger of posting his location on Twitter. He got lucky this time. There are some weirdoes out there.  Bom bom bom bom badum bom badum. Bom bom bom bom badum bom badum. Bom bom badala baba badalum bom badala bom bom forgot my keys bom bom bom bom badum bom badum…
27279,Penny,Yes. I love chilli cheese fries.
27280,Leonard,I’m serious. I’ll do it.
27281,Penny,Oh yeah I’m a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.
27283,Leonard,Would you rather I didn’t tell you?
27284,Howard,I’m happy for you Sheldon. But I have to admit I’m going to miss sharing an office with you.
27285,Leonard,Okay there are ogre tracks and a trail of broken candy canes in the snow. Sheldon what do you do?
27286,Raj,Well somebody else knows because they saw it in the folder.
27288,Penny,How long have I had spinach in my teeth?
27289,Howard,Does it work?
27290,Penny,Alright why not five and ten bucks?
27291,Penny,Come on Sheldon. Just give it a try.
27292,Raj,You know screw it I’m just gonna eat the dumpling.
27293,Sheldon,Leonard wait.
27294,Leonard,No he’d be Bat-Man-Bat.
27295,Penny,Well how ’bout when you were 17?
27296,Penny,Wow. Where are you going to go?
27297,Sheldon,They’d just be so much more comforting if they came out of a television.
27298,Sheldon,You have any frozen yogurt?
27299,Sheldon,That’s it I’m down to seven friends.
27300,Leonard,Good for you on the cutting edge of new technology and still making inappropriate comments about the mother of your child.
27301,Penny,Okay. So the usual with extra spit on Sheldon’s hamburger.
27302,Penny,Come on Sheldon. You and me right here.
27304,Sheldon,And unfriend Leonard Hofstadter.
27305,Sheldon,Hmm.  All right all right. I see what’s going on. A little pre-Halloween hijinkery. A ghostly moan a rattling of chains a witch’s cackle. The trifecta of haunted house clichés. Instead of eek I say yawn.
27306,Penny,Leonard.
27307,Sheldon,How dare you?
27308,Sheldon,Good one. And an electrical charge.
27309,Leonard,Very good. And then a laser will map the reflective surface and voila. 
27310,Sheldon,Yeah but I just told you I don’t have a problem with closure.
27311,Sheldon,All right.
27312,Howard,Did you really have to bring it in with you?
27313,Raj,Okay.
27314,Sheldon,Oh I won’t. I only eat equilateral triangles. Isosceles isosceles oh scalene. You didn’t see that.
27315,Sheldon,Right now would be good.
27316,Penny,What am I smelling?
27317,Raj,Ooh Hallow-weenies! That’s a good one. They’ll pair nicely with my Draculoni and Cheese. How do I do it?
27318,Leonard,What I can’t propose? I can’t talk to my friends? Is there anything else I’m not allowed to do?
27319,Leonard,Don’t.
27320,Sheldon,Well I don’t think our relationship is a joke. I think “a horse goes into a bar bartender says why the long face?’ that’s a joke. It’s a good one too because a horse has a long face.
27321,Penny,You work with her? How could you not tell me that?
27322,Raj,Yeah you’d think. Ooh maybe I could sell my blood and sperm.
27323,Leonard,I don’t know. Scree-scree.
27324,Sheldon,Hysterical.
27325,Leonard,Come on.
27326,Leonard,Hmm.
27327,Sheldon,Oh now what about our 3-D chess set?
27328,Penny,What’s taking so long?
27329,Penny,No. Did you figure out what you’re gonna do about the two girls?
27330,Leonard,Do you understand that this was supposed to be a date?
27331,Penny,What?
27332,Raj,Nope pants in the microwave no notebook.
27333,Penny,Oh gee Amy I’m sorry I’m actually pretty busy this weekend.
27334,Penny,If you like this girl so much why don’t you just end things with Priya?
27335,Leonard,They did.
27336,Raj,Where does he poop?
27337,Sheldon,Yes. I read recently about a fellow in Kansas with an enormous ball of twine. I bet you could give him a run for his money.
27338,Penny,Uh no thanks.
27340,Leonard,Uh oh sorry.
27341,Sheldon,Hello.
27342,Leonard,Lactose.
27343,Leonard,Did… okay maybe  some of it but look the guy was just in the right place at the right time with the right paradigm-shifting reinterpretation of the universe. He got lucky.
27344,Penny,Oh that’s really sweet.
27345,Leonard,Then I believe that God created the world in six days and on the seventh he made you to annoy me.
27346,Sheldon,I am doing it.
27347,Howard,Did you think it would be funny to put on a pair of her panties and jump around but it wound up just creeping her out?
27348,Penny,When was the last time you got a massage?
27349,Penny,Yeah this is not gonna be enough coffee.
27351,Howard,Dude everyone knows a time machine loses half its value the minute you drive it off the lot.
27352,Leonard,Um whew? Is this about the test or is this about us?
27353,Raj,I know.
27354,Raj,It was a tutorial. And yes I’m happy to keep Sheldon company.
27355,Raj,He takes the elf from off the shelf.
27356,Leonard,Can’t argue with that. I’ll get the tickets.
27357,Raj,Oh yes. There was a very official email that was sent to everyone whose insurance files indicated they had daughters between the ages of 14 and 16.
27358,Howard,Mmmmmm.
27360,Leonard,I don’t think something like that’s even possible.
27361,Sheldon,Wait Svaty Vaclav was the Duke of Bohemia.
27362,Penny,What?
27363,Sheldon,And you want me to return it for you?
27364,Penny,Oh Amy! Get the hell out of here!
27365,Sheldon,Oh hello Amy.
27366,Penny,Oh it’s no problem Amy and Sheldon were just telling us about their trip to Texas.
27367,Penny,Well maybe he doesn’t know how to say it without hurting her feelings.
27368,Howard,Bye buddy!
27369,Leonard,Well in case you were in the mood for baseball I didn’t want to look ridiculous.
27370,Howard,You can’t leave. You’re a suspect in the mysterious murder of Stuart Bloom.
27371,Sheldon,Yeah. Call first. 
27372,Sheldon,Let’s see. What’s next? Oh kissing’s romantic.
27373,Penny,Yep.
27374,Penny,Look Sheldon Leonard is dating Priya. She is staying with Raj. That means you’re all probably gonna be hanging out there more.
27375,Leonard,What does she think I am?
27377,Leonard,No. But compared to your boss he’s the poster boy for sanity.
27379,Raj,Excuse me I’ll be right back. Don’t go anywhere. Don’t move. Just stay the beautiful unspoiled American flower that you are.  What’s wrong with you dude that woman was all up in my jammy.
27380,Leonard,Yeah where’s he gonna sleep?
27381,Sheldon,Yeah right on man. Right on. Oh look it’s Harry Potter and 98% of The Sorcerer’s Stone.
27382,Sheldon,Oh right. Well my friends and I couldn’t get into Comic-Con this year and I was trying to start my own convention and I was going to ask if you would be a panelist.
27383,Sheldon,They were not friends they were imaginary colleagues.
27384,Leonard,That sounds lovely.
27385,Sheldon,I was going chronologically. You’re right between Koothrappali’s father and Omar the one-eyed Sparkletts guy.
27386,Penny,Okay honey did you even know the people that are moving out?
27387,Penny,Whoa! That’s heavy.
27388,Sheldon,Why?
27389,Raj,Oh great. No Superman no Wonder Woman? All we’ve got is a skinny Flash an Indian Aquaman a nearsighted Green Lantern and a teeny tiny Dark Knight.
27390,Raj,Hoo-hoo-hoo. The only thing missing from that insult was “yo mamma.”
27391,Sheldon,So? Do cocaine smugglers write cocaine on the box?
27392,Leonard,That is so sweet. In 25 to 30 minutes I’m gonna show you how much this means to me.
27393,Penny,Hey I happen to love this movie.
27394,Sheldon,Santa?
27395,Leonard,Wow that’s a big step.
27396,Sheldon,Amy has ended our relationship.
27397,Leonard,Is that who I think it is?
27398,Leonard,What is happening?
27399,Leonard,I don’t think you have anything to worry about. Raj is a terrific guy loyal to a fault.
27400,Sheldon,On oatmeal day?
27401,Sheldon,Not necessary. No. I found a service that’ll send a van to your house for a teeth cleaning. Mostly they cater to dogs but the fellow on the phone seemed to have an open mind.
27402,Leonard,And what would I have said afterwards?
27403,Howard,Good good. Then you have nothing to worry about.
27404,Penny,Okay. So what do you need?
27405,Sheldon,Bleuch. Like cleaning out the entire building’s belly button.
27406,Penny,Just pick up a worm and put him on this hook.
27407,Sheldon,I’m sorry. It’s not optional.
27408,Penny,What? How did you manage that?
27409,Leonard,Well I was doing some government research at the time you know military rocket fuel. It’s kind of secret.
27410,Howard,Wait what happened to us?
27411,Leonard,You can recognize people on Google Earth?
27413,Howard,Alright this goes without saying but I’m just going to say it anyway. Hands off my sister.
27414,Penny,I just don’t see how see can pull this off.
27415,Leonard,Hey.
27416,Howard,What do you want Sheldon?
27417,Sheldon,My point.
27418,Howard,Upsilon?
27419,Leonard,Yeah just get it over with.
27420,Howard,I believe that’s the president of the university.
27421,Leonard,No that’s Marcie. Peppermint Patty’s just athletic.
27422,Sheldon,I’ll have the chicken noodle. Goodnight.
27423,Leonard,Oh my God! Are you… 
27424,Raj,Uh so you’ll watch it?
27425,Howard,Have you ever heard of the Kama Sutra?
27426,Leonard,Okay how about this? I’ll do the talking you just stand behind me and try to look formidable.
27427,Sheldon,You do this I delete your contact information.
27428,Howard,Guys help me.
27429,Sheldon,No. Start over.
27430,Raj,Dude I’m glad you finally got a girlfriend but do you have to do all that lovey-dovey stuff in front of those of us who don’t?
27431,Sheldon,Very well. You got married spur of the moment I don’t see why your divorce should be any different.
27432,Howard,I bet you told Bernadette all about how he was screwing around with Mandy Chao.
27433,Leonard,Seedy underbelly?
27434,Howard,Hey dude Trent just checked in at the coffee shop on Fair Oaks.
27435,Sheldon,Come on Leonard I am spoon-feeding this to you.
27436,Raj,Hey the jaw wants what it wants.
27437,Sheldon,Uh fine. FYI secret-keeping? Hate it. Hand-holding? Not a fan. Hammerhead shark? I love that thing. Yeah it’s another fish with a tool on its head.
27438,Sheldon,No no no that’s okay. I can fight my own battles. Isn’t that right Bawwy.
27439,Penny,Okay so what you want me to be like a teacher’s pet?
27440,Howard,No no this is brand new. We haven’t even been on a proper date yet.
27441,Raj,Hey just because a man shows caring for another man doesn’t mean he’s displaying the love that dare not speak its name. Did she definitely say she didn’t want kids?
27442,Howard,But I’m always on Howard’s team. We’re best friends. The kind who finish each others…
27443,Leonard,Give me that.
27444,Leonard,Can you please talk to him?
27445,Sheldon,Flattering but sadly no. I’m also planning to begin an exercise regimen designed to strengthen my cardiovascular system. AKA jogging.
27446,Leonard,Well then that was wrong of us. We need to widen our circle.
27448,Sheldon, Good buddy Leonard.
27449,Sheldon,Oh yes but there’s usually planning courtship and advance notice. Last time I was able to book a cruise to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse.
27450,Leonard,So Polly tell me about yourself.
27451,Penny,You can hear my toilet flush?
27454,Penny,They must’ve cut it.
27455,Raj,Brisket party! B-to-the-R-to-the-I-S-K… To-the-E-to-the-T… Ooh…
27456,Howard,Do you think this is cool?
27457,Howard,Yes?
27458,Sheldon,Really? I never imagined it any other way.
27459,Sheldon,Sorry… excuse me… my bad… student driver…
27460,Penny,Hey. I’m just coming back from the airport. I wanted to see how you’re doing.
27461,Leonard,You get a cookie too.
27462,Penny,Yes.
27463,Sheldon,Don’t talk to me like I’m a child. Now take me to return my star wars sheets!
27464,Leonard,Thank you. Sorry.
27466,Leonard,Yeah.
27467,Sheldon,Oh nonsense Wil. Your endless tweets are not that bad.
27468,Raj,Yeah I was wrong. But I do think you and I would have had a great time.
27469,Leonard,You promise?
27470,Penny,Okay what did Amy tell you?
27471,Howard,I worked on it all night. Use it.
27472,Howard,Okay uh I’d pick swan because uh the resulting hybrid would have the advanced industrial civilization of a human and the long graceful neck I’ve always dreamed of having.
27473,Raj,Don’t do that in socks I almost broke my neck.
27474,Penny,Well a little. You hear stuff.
27475,Leonard,Just two. Everyday and dress.
27476,Leonard,Fine. With.
27477,Raj,Dude if you’re going to be an astronaut you need to pick a cool nickname.
27478,Sheldon,Oh dear Lord!
27479,Leonard,Delightful. Listen I don’t know what you’re doing right now but there are little bubbles forming on the corners of Sheldon’s mouth.
27480,Leonard,So when it’s your turn you can.
27481,Raj,Yeah it depends on the privacy settings.
27483,Leonard,Did they hate it?
27484,Penny,Anyone else want to try?
27485,Sheldon,I may be an alien but I have urges. If Amy wants to copulate by firing her eggs into space well then I will happily catch them with the reproductive sac on my upper flermin. I’m not the best at reading facial cues but I can see that you’re a little turned on.
27486,Leonard,Sheldon do you see what just happened here?
27487,Sheldon,I just came by to say hello.
27488,Howard,And just so you know it’s only temporary. I’m not gonna get too comfortable.
27489,Sheldon,Can you believe my mother thinks we’re both strange?
27490,Raj,I’m not happy it’s the medication I can’t stop smiling. 
27491,Sheldon,Yes. You’re afraid that costume makes you look fat.
27492,Leonard,Sheldon.
27493,Leonard,And we can just put this whole thing behind us.
27494,Howard,Oh Penny. That’s ridiculous. You know you love him. You you look him in the eyes and you say it.
27495,Sheldon,Are there beans in it?
27496,Raj,Oh well her last name is Sweeney and something just didn’t seem right about Koothrapeeney.
27497,Penny,Yes I know men can’t fly.
27498,Howard,Hello.
27499,Sheldon,Thank you. I’d like to make a sandwich but I’m out of bread.
27500,Sheldon,Why?
27501,Penny,All right.
27502,Raj,Oh God! Yes we get it. You have a girlfriend now.
27503,Penny,Sweetie you’re yelling.
27505,Penny,Oh anyways I’m also writing a screenplay. It’s about this sensitive girl who comes to L.A. from Lincoln Nebraska to be an actress and winds up a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.
27506,Howard,Okay.
27507,Penny,What?
27508,Howard,Well astrophysicist.
27509,Sheldon,Just need a little more practice.
27510,Penny,Oh sure. Like when you send me to kill spiders in your bathtub. Wow. Okay. Four months.
27511,Sheldon,Mmm all right. It would appear as if alcohol is playing keep-away with your intelligence. Good night. Please note it is now past ten p.m. Per our roommate agreement kindly refrain from raucous laughter clinking of glasses and celebratory gunfire.
27512,Sheldon,Of what? Poorly executed beards?
27513,Penny,What’s it say?
27514,Howard,Two.
27515,Raj,Water Demon.
27516,Penny,Yeah.
27517,Sheldon, Amy. Will you marry me?
27518,Leonard,Okay see you later.
27519,Raj,No it’s a gentle kick you’re doing it wrong. Here. Give me those.
27520,Penny,Okay just to be clear the first piece of jewellery my boyfriend gives me is a prop from a movie and I don’t even get to keep it?
27521,Sheldon,Oh great. Do you want to go halfsies on a two hundred dollar squirt gun?
27522,Leonard,What are you doing?
27523,Sheldon,Well you seem hot under the collar or is that the sweater?
27524,Leonard,Oh I’m flattered. So how do you suggest we proceed?
27525,Howard,Have you heard back from Emily?
27526,Penny,Fine. Hanging with my boyfriend. Talk to you later. Happy?
27527,Penny,Boy Bernadette is gonna love this.
27529,Howard,Oh man when I come out of the closet I’m gonna nail those guys. Yeah I heard it. Shut up.
27530,Penny,No. Why do you?
27531,Penny,Thanks Raj. Okay so here’s the thing I was wondering if you could maybe teach me a little physics?
27532,Leonard,Hi Mrs. Cooper. Thanks for coming.
27533,Howard,Okay. First order of physics bowl business. We need a truly kick-ass team name. Suggestions.
27534,Sheldon,Once. The battery ran out on my phone. I had to wait for my iPad to turn on.
27535,Leonard,Why are you doing this?
27536,Penny,Well sweetie that’s crazy.
27537,Howard,He’s gonna be here any second what should we do?
27538,Howard,Oh they did. Like jasmine and honeysuckle.
27539,Sheldon,And what special circumstances are those?
27540,Leonard,You just called dibs.
27541,Leonard,Coming!
27542,Sheldon,Sure.
27543,Leonard,Excuse me. Is there anything you’d like to apologise for?
27544,Howard,No you’re displaying a shocking ignorance of the subject matter. Mummies and zombies are the exact same thing.
27545,Leonard,You’re right I do feel better.
27546,Sheldon,I wasn’t referring to this evening. Ten years ago upon first seeing me your husband claimed that I looked like C-3PO and Pee-wee Herman. And he called me C-3P-wee Herman.
27547,Leonard,Okay well you know this isn’t that bad. It just paints the picture of a very affectionate woman who’s open to expressing her affection in non traditional locales.
27548,Penny,It’s okay I’ll still go.
27549,Leonard,Raj Imperial Troopers on your tail.
27550,Leonard,Well I spent most of the afternoon growing isotopically pure crystals for neutrino detection.
27551,Leonard,Ready when you are Professor Hawking.
27552,Leonard,Exactly. And you owe it to yourself and to posterity to protect the genetic integrity of your sister’s future offspring.
27553,Howard,Oh. Is it Amy?
27554,Penny,Oh Giselle’s not getting kicked off. It’s totally going to be Summer.  What?
27555,Raj,Is this about the space thing again?
27556,Sheldon,Yes. I decided to find a way that I could have this experience and enjoy it.
27557,Sheldon,Oh no.
27558,Sheldon,I ask you for one simple thing and you can’t even do it.
27559,Penny,Here this will help.
27560,Sheldon,Well what I meant was I often misinterpret how others are feeling. Like I can’t always tell if someone is only joking or laughing at me. You know like uh if they’re mad at something I’ve done or just in a bad mood. It it’s incredibly stressful.
27562,Sheldon,Oh what choice do I have? You need me. I’m like the crankshaft of this team.
27563,Penny,Oh Leonard mumbles it when he wants sex to last longer.
27564,Penny,Okay look here’s the thing. I like pharmaceutical sales it’s going great but I have an audition for a movie and if I get it it could screw everything up.
27565,Penny,Hey what are you guys doing here?
27566,Leonard,That’s actually funny.
27567,Penny,Hey here’s your tip from table seven.
27568,Leonard,Don’t tell anybody I told you but I heard she might be breaking up with him.
27569,Sheldon,But first I cast a spell of paralysis on Stuart and Howard.
27570,Leonard,No!
27571,Sheldon,No I know but plenty of things are addictive after a single exposure. I mean crack cocaine nicotine Pringles. You know once one pops one just can’t stop.
27572,Leonard,He doesn’t; he just likes looking at them. Bring a book.
27573,Howard,What’s wrong with Mexico?
27574,Penny,You really think we made a mistake?
27575,Leonard,Very hard.
27576,Sheldon,Well it was the two of you who found Amy Farrah Fowler for me. Now that I’m looking for my next girlfriend it seemed only logical that I employ your services once again.
27577,Raj,Hello?
27578,Penny,I really should have brought my own car.
27579,Sheldon,Raj? What are you doing? I don’t think so. You’ve had your allotted six ounces. The first bathroom break isn’t until the Denny’s located near Bakersfield which is approximately two and half hours away. Remember people we’re only as strong as our weakest bladder.
27580,Howard,Really? Because usually we walk side by side and I just went up two flights of stairs staring at your bottom.
27582,Sheldon,Yeah please reserve chitchat for your breaks Ms. Jenson. FYI there will be no breaks.
27583,Sheldon,Thank you. You know I can buy all these things online. I come here for the personal service.
27584,Leonard,Alright noted. But my point is that Koothrappali and Wolowitz… they’re hitting on your sister.
27585,Penny,You’re kidding.
27586,Howard,Why would it be too big a step?
27587,Penny,Yeah why?
27588,Sheldon,No as long as it bobbles.
27589,Sheldon, Leonard.
27590,Leonard,No no no. Hang on. I believe I’m supposed to carry you across the threshold.
27591,Howard,Maybe there’s a way to get them to come up with it.
27592,Penny,Yeah but only because I was dating a second grader.
27593,Penny,Excuse me?
27594,Sheldon,‘Sup?
27595,Sheldon,No no. It’s not an imposition. At this point in our ecosystem you are akin to the plover a small scavenging bird that eats extra food from between the teeth of crocodiles. Please fly into our open maw and have at it.
27596,Howard,Oh cool. Can I play?
27597,Sheldon,May I have one of your fries?
27598,Sheldon,That would be you. But residing within you is the potential for another me. Perhaps even taller smarter and less prone to freckling a Sheldon 2.0 if you will.
27599,Sheldon,All right what if we use this two-inch PVC to reinforce the centre cross-support?
27600,Howard,Yeah. Start Saturday morning go 48 hours sleeping bags junk food.
27601,Sheldon,What if the fighting is the reason we’re making progress?
27602,Leonard,Yeah perfect.
27603,Sheldon,Have you ever considered trying to do something useful? Perhaps reading to the elderly?
27604,Penny,Okay so what is solder?
27605,Penny,Oh Amy you lucky girl.
27606,Sheldon,Oh wait here. I’ll get some Alka-Seltzer we can build that rocket and we can shoot it at Bill Nye’s house. As long as I’m not within 500 feet of it.
27607,Sheldon,Well you call it love but it has a lot of raisins in it.
27608,Leonard,Well when you get the machine you can find out.
27609,Sheldon,Oh I have quite the evening planned. Our foetus-friendly festival of fun begins with an in-depth look at the world of model trains and then we’ll kick things up a notch and explore all the different ways that you can make toast.
27610,Leonard,Why say it?
27611,Penny,Um NC… II… or you know NCSTD… I don’t know it’s it’s you know it’s the one with the letters and I’m gonna be on it!
27612,Raj,He’s been murdered by someone in this room.
27613,Penny,Right. Um okay. Leonard I mean you’re not only the love of my life. I mean you’re my best friend and you’ve got a friend in me. You got troubles. I got ’em too. There isn’t anything I wouldn’t do for you. We stick together and we can see it through ’cause you’ve got a friend in me.
27614,Penny,I don’t think the manager’s coming tonight so here.
27615,Penny,I don’t think so.
27616,Leonard,Obviously when I saw that you were in ours I went and used another one.
27617,Penny,Get out!
27618,Leonard,Hey.
27619,Leonard,I’m going to my room.
27620,Sheldon,Careful it’s addictive.
27621,Penny,Once again you got me.
27622,Howard,Interesting. That might explain my weepy days in the middle of the month. You know what I’m talking about.
27623,Sheldon,Yes.
27624,Penny,What’s with the robe?
27625,Leonard,Thank you.
27626,Leonard,When I broke my arm I used to stick a coat hanger down there. You ever try that? Maybe go in through the ear?
27627,Raj,Terrific.
27628,Raj,Mm I’m thinking about adopting some quirky affectation like a pipe or a monocle or a handlebar moustache.
27629,Penny,Oh you are such a…  What the hell is he doing?
27630,Sheldon,This conversation is over.
27631,Howard,Do you know what he’s talking about?
27632,Sheldon,I spoke to the reporter at the magazine.
27633,Howard,I I hope we didn’t make the puzzles too hard.
27634,Sheldon,This is so amazing.
27635,Sheldon,Brown rice not white?
27636,Leonard,That sounds like a late night and I have work in the morning so…
27637,Leonard,Me too.
27638,Penny,Right right. Anyway Sheldon here is a huge fan of yours and he was supposed to meet you the other day at the comic book store but he kind of ended up in jail.
27639,Penny,Yep.
27640,Sheldon,You bet your sweet B I won’t.
27641,Howard,You being the fish.
27642,Leonard,Kites ho!
27643,Sheldon,Hello.
27644,Sheldon,Oh I’m fine. Why did you come?
27645,Sheldon,Mwah-ha-ha.
27646,Leonard,Yep.
27647,Leonard,Wait let me see if I got this right. You actually asked Bernadette to leave your house in the middle of the night?
27648,Raj,I’m sorry?
27649,Sheldon,I erotically caress your  nose.
27650,Howard,Uh that was my dad on the phone. He moved out.
27651,Penny,Sheldon this isn’t that hard.
27652,Leonard,Oh how kind of her.
27653,Leonard,Well he’s a patent attorney. Maybe his tie is pending.
27654,Penny,I know the reason.
27655,Raj,Yeah I think we’re getting close.
27656,Leonard,Then make soup.
27657,Leonard,Hold on. That’s it!
27659,Sheldon,Oh listen to them. Not even married and the honeymoon’s over.
27660,Sheldon,I’m doing all right. I tried fencing today.
27661,Penny,Oh come on try me.
27662,Leonard,Oh I’d watch that.
27663,Sheldon,I know and Amy says I can’t have a train room.
27664,Howard,Uh he’s Indian. We’ve already got one of those. Ooh we should find a nice Latino really round us out.
27665,Raj,Open it.
27666,Leonard,Sure. Black right?
27667,Penny,Forget it. I’m not wearing the wig.
27668,Howard,I didn’t even know there was a President’s dining room.
27669,Howard,Aren’t you leaving for your booty call?
27670,Sheldon,One vintage Mr. Mxyzptlk action figure. That’s Leonard’s.
27671,Raj,Hey Leonard?
27672,Sheldon,Are you sure? I’ve heard that on those sites often when you think you’re corresponding with someone it’s actually a computer program pretending to be a real person.
27673,Penny,That’s um rum and coke without the rum.
27674,Raj,Hey guys.
27675,Penny,How are flower barrettes going to appeal to men?
27676,Raj,What? Why?
27677,Raj,Later dude.
27678,Sheldon,All right! First of all Dr. Koothrappali when I first proposed that you work with me…
27679,Sheldon,We don’t need Howard’s cousin. No we have me.
27680,Penny,Thank you.
27681,Penny,Oh honey the buses don’t go where you live do they?
27682,Penny,Hey can I ask you a question?
27683,Leonard,No I mean why are you going to so much trouble to prove that you’re smarter than Wolowitz?
27684,Penny,Okay Beverley aren’t you overreacting a little? All we know is they shared a cab and had a nightcap.
27685,Leonard,Yes he is.
27686,Howard,Oh my God that’s who you look like.
27687,Howard,I thought you were a badass.
27688,Penny,Uh well I’d probably sleep in do a little yoga then lie on the beach while cute cabana boys brought me drinks and probably get a massage and then cap off the night with some dancing.
27689,Raj,Sixty years. Used to be a watch factory.
27690,Raj,How come on Star Trek everybody’s private parts are the same. No alien lady ever told Captain Kirk hey get your thing out of my nose.
27691,Leonard,Oh sorry I didn’t know you were busy. Maybe another time.
27692,Howard,Okay I think I see what’s happening here. You’re jealous of me.
27693,Leonard,This is ridiculous. 
27694,Howard,Whoa. Humongous man crush dude.
27695,Penny,That’s great.
27696,Penny,Hmm. Well I guess it’s just gonna remain a mystery you know like whatever happened in that seminar after they dimmed the lights.
27697,Leonard,Okay. So Wolowitz and Stuart are paralyzed Santa’s dead and I picked this over having sex with my girlfriend.
27698,Leonard,Come on Howard the odds of us picking up girls in a bar are practically zero.
27699,Raj,There’s nothing to tell.
27700,Howard,Come on.
27701,Penny,I am the one who spent two years trying to get him to even go to the beach in the first place. And he was so phobic about stepping on medical waste I had to carry him to the water.
27702,Sheldon,I can’t take your money.
27703,Sheldon,Monogrammed key chains with a built-in laser pointer. No? How about can cosies emblazoned with our university mascot? Go Beavers. I’ll be back.
27704,Sheldon,I don’t understand.
27705,Sheldon,Who?
27706,Penny,Okay show’s over.
27707,Raj,Go for stereo.
27708,Sheldon,Hey look at that. Even in your example you’re all by yourself.
27709,Howard,I guess that’s okay.
27710,Penny,Babies? Well I’m not in a rush but someday yeah sure. What about you?
27711,Leonard,Can we please talk about something else? Maybe something vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet?
27712,Sheldon,I want that one.
27713,Leonard,What?
27714,Sheldon,Come to think of it I would! You little lady are on fire.
27715,Raj,Follow your heart.
27716,Raj,You fail to take into account that even mute I am foreign and exotic while you on the other hand are frail and pasty.
27717,Leonard,I hope you’re hungry Bernadette we’re going to a terrific restaurant.
27718,Raj,Okay uh what if we make Rocket Man your ringtone and the next time you talk to those guys I’ll call you and they’ll hear it. Plant the seed.
27719,Sheldon,Oh everything. Getting our picture taken slow-dancing being elected prom king. Pointing out that kings aren’t elected. It’s gonna be off the hook.
27721,Penny,I’m not gonna say anything. I just want to check her out. Because she hurt my friend. My Indian friend. Who’s racist now?
27722,Leonard,It’s been three and a half minutes wake up.
27723,Sheldon,All right remember his meemaw’s alive and be the ball.
27724,Penny,What name?
27725,Howard,So did you confront Jennifer?
27726,Penny,Um yeah why what’s wrong with it?
27727,Penny,Nobody knows. That’s why he’s number one. Can you please go talk to him?
27728,Penny,What?
27729,Sheldon,Well it’s not a great question. How could somebody possibly think we’re going to blow up the moon? That’s a great question.
27730,Penny,Me too.
27731,Penny,What’s wrong?
27732,Sheldon,She’s also a bit of a know-it-all. Mmm. This is good. Whatever it is.
27734,Sheldon,Oh I suppose that’s a discussion we could have.
27735,Penny,Okay where is this coming from?
27736,Penny,Who’s my favorite member of NSYNC?
27737,Sheldon,Will you keep it down? What kind of vengeful bed and breakfast do you think I’m running?
27738,Raj,Wow.
27739,Sheldon,You know I don’t drive.
27740,Sheldon,Did you laugh?
27741,Leonard,He didn’t meant that.
27742,Leonard,Um since when can Koothrappali talk in front of the girls without a beer?
27743,Leonard,A couple years but I just put a few bucks aside every month for emergencies.
27744,Raj,I’m telling you dude there’s a seat on the Hogwarts Express with your name on it.
27745,Raj,While showering topless 16 minutes after brief side butt during a pillow fight with her sorority sisters.
27747,Penny,Oh hey guys. You having a good time?
27748,Sheldon,Are you going to say it’s all part of God’s plan?
27749,Raj,No doubt sign here.
27750,Raj,Yeah that’s not worrisome at all.
27751,Penny,Oh come on what is that?
27752,Leonard,What is it?
27753,Leonard,You really think he’s gonna send us to a bowling alley?
27754,Leonard,Of course I did. I talked and talked and talked.
27755,Leonard,It’s a prop from a movie and we’re kind of fighting over it.
27756,Penny,Uh-uh.
27757,Howard,I was thinking we could watch a DVD.
27758,Howard,I can’t believe your attitude. I thought you were in favour of gay people getting married.
27759,Raj,Shotgun.
27760,Sheldon,I was always afraid this day would come. This might be the first step of my descent into madness where I gradually test the limits of public nudity.
27761,Sheldon,I don’t watch you 24 hours a day. I don’t know what you do.
27762,Leonard,Well it’s just kind of weird how grown up he is now. Happily married guy throwing dinner parties.
27763,Sheldon,Excuse me.
27764,Sheldon,Get it together man.
27765,Raj,Hi.
27766,Howard,He just went colon capital O.
27767,Sheldon,Leonard? Leonard?
27768,Penny,Alright look a tie on the doorknob usually means someone doesn’t want to be disturbed because they’re you know getting busy.
27769,Sheldon,Look you’re not leaving yourself enough space between cars.
27770,Leonard,Look I know you guys don’t want to do this but we have no choice. So you can either bitch and whine or we can just get it over with.
27771,Leonard,Then why can’t we tell your parents?
27772,Sheldon,All right. 12 minutes and 17 seconds.
27773,Leonard,So are you gonna give us a clue where we’re headed?
27774,Leonard,Oh. That’s great. Great great great. Why wait so long to tell me?
27775,Leonard,What’s going on?
27776,Penny,Hey Leonard.
27777,Raj,Isabella. Isabella wait wait let me explain.
27778,Sheldon,Every year tens of people around the world are killed by birds. I’m not going to be another statistic.
27779,Leonard,Oh don’t say cute. That’s the worst.
27780,Sheldon,Ooh perhaps it’s a Heliosheath scintillation.
27781,Sheldon,I’d like to buy a scone.
27782,Raj,Yes I am. The god Kamadeva has shot us with his flowery arrows of love.
27783,Raj,And you didn’t think to tell me?
27784,Howard,Then I’d take you home slip off your little black dress and just pile-drive you into oblivion.
27785,Leonard,Ma’am.
27786,Leonard,Forget about the cake how did you know that my birthday is Saturday?
27787,Leonard,That’s not true remember at Thanksgiving my grandmother with Alzheimer’s had that episode.
27788,Leonard,Oh couldn’t be better.
27789,Leonard,Message received. Ah excuse me.  Hello. This is Dr. Hofstadter. Okay. All right thank you. That’s weird. I’m getting called in to Human Resources.
27790,Sheldon,Well done it worked we’re going.
27791,Howard,It’s okay. Oh it’s okay. He’s done.
27792,Leonard,Well it’s not as much surprised as uh uh you know uh. th-th-th-the other thing.
27793,Raj,Yeah. Good or devastating.
27794,Leonard,Okay you have every right to be mad. And what you said is true. You do make more money than me. So I had no right to do what I did. And I’m so sorry. I hope you can forgive me.
27795,Leonard,Um tomorrow?
27796,Leonard,There there.
27797,Howard,He brought you a pretty rock.
27798,Penny,Actually I have to pick up my friend Justin from the airport.
27799,Leonard,Maybe we should have asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend.
27800,Penny,Oh I know. Bernadette told me. Sorry Sheldon. I know that game meant a lot to you.
27801,Sheldon,I don’t want my job back. I’ve spent the last three and a half years staring at greaseboards full of equations. Before that I spent four years working on my thesis. Before that I was in college and before that I was in the fifth grade. This is my first day off in decades and I’m going to savour it.
27802,Raj,Good. Sheldon’s out of town so we can do whatever we want. We even ordered from the Thai place he doesn’t like.
27803,Leonard,Ask him for a napkin I dare you.  I’ll get it.
27804,Penny,No?
27805,Raj,Great.
27806,Leonard,Why are you even part of this conversation? You don’t know anything about women.
27807,Leonard,Hey look it’s Howard and his girlfriend Bernadette.
27808,Sheldon,Leonard where do you stand on the anthropic principle?
27809,Howard,Yeah like in the movies I saw growing up in India. You know uh Four for Texas Yellow Rose of Texas.
27810,Sheldon,More wrong? Wrong is an absolute state and not subject to gradation.
27811,Sheldon,Well you know what else was just a suggestion? Why don’t we change the Raisin Bran box? Hmm? And you know who got hurt by that? Every single person who eats breakfast.
27812,Leonard,Let’s get out of here.
27813,Raj,Do you think he’s building a bomb?
27814,Sheldon,Well yes but you’re the one who said hello to her when she moved in. If you’d simply restrained yourself none of this would be happening.
27815,Sheldon,Mind you when we say behind the flags we don’t literally mean these flags. That’s just where we have dinner.
27816,Raj,Ooh this is exciting. Like one of my classic murder mystery dinner parties.
27818,Raj,Of course. I know what it’s like having to go through a loved one’s possessions. My uncle was a worshipper of Krishna. But after he died you know what we found? A statue of Shiva. It may not be Crips and Bloods okay? But in India it’s a thing.
27819,Leonard,There’s gotta be something else we could try.
27820,Howard,Okay how about uh on your mark get set go?
27821,Howard,And you’re eating alone at a deli. I don’t buy it you’re not him.
27822,Sheldon,At the end of the haircut Mr. D’Onofrio would tell me a dirty joke.
27823,Sheldon,Thank you Penny.
27824,Leonard,The kids are gonna love him.
27825,Penny,Okay so how do they unstick it?
27827,Sheldon,Do you have a working knowledge of quantum physics?
27829,Penny,All right look I’m sorry I said I was okay with everything before we got married. I hate that we’re going through this but I don’t know what to do.
27830,Raj,Okay nice talking to you.
27831,Howard,On Caprica night?
27832,Sheldon,I think Dr. Nowitzki is a friendly colleague. I think you and Leonard need to see a marriage counsellor. And I need to update my résumé to include swimming as a special skill.
27833,Raj,I was when I came in but it’s amazing what liquor does to guilt. Besides what you might not know is Bernadette is planning on breaking up with Howard.
27834,Raj,It was just this one time Papa I swear.
27835,Leonard,Hey do you remember when we went wine tasting in Santa Barbara and you said that was you’d ever had?
27836,Raj,As long as we’re apologising Sheldon I I’m sorry I used your toothbrush.
27837,Sheldon,Did you know that Leonard has a perfect driving record and enjoys the insurance discounts that go along with that? Hubba-hubba.
27838,Leonard,But I-I-I oh. Nothing about that was good.
27839,Sheldon,Well then you leave me no alternative. From this moment forward we can be roommates but we will no longer be friends.
27840,Sheldon,Don’t feel bad. Neither does he.
27841,Sheldon,No one signed up.
27842,Penny,Oh gee sounds amazing but um I’ve got some friends coming over. Not a big thing we’re just gonna watch the Nebraska game.
27844,Leonard,Are you sure?
27845,Sheldon,Nah you’re right that’s dumb.
27846,Sheldon,Exactly but we’d have to if she was here.
27847,Raj,How about you decide this with Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?
27848,Leonard,Yes.
27849,Penny,Okay it’s not like she’s got the Christ child in there all right?  Oh. It’s Leonard. He says Sheldon’s drunk and they’re gonna do karaoke if we want to join them.
27850,Penny,You know there are a lot of successful people in this country who are community college graduates.
27851,Penny,All right let’s start with a toe touch. Okay you do it.
27852,Sheldon,You shouldn’t keep your bread in the refrigerator. Staleness is caused by crystallization of the starch molecules which occurs faster at cool temperatures.
27853,Penny,It would be humiliating.
27854,Penny,Don’t you usually get lemonade?
27855,Howard,Yeah.
27856,Leonard,Oh wow.
27857,Howard,If you’re offended let go of the ring and go on home to your mother’s boobies.
27858,Penny,Ugh did you lose anything valuable?
27859,Penny,It’s open.
27860,Raj,Why are you being like this?
27861,Howard,Oh good because she also walks my dog buys my groceries and cuts my hair.
27862,Sheldon,Apparently a semi-incestuous Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown didn’t count.
27863,Leonard,What does that mean under your bed?
27864,Leonard,Oh well it’s you Swamp Thing Stephen Hawking Spider-Man but look you’re in the mix.
27865,Sheldon,Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? Are you…. hey look that fixes the problem I’ve been having.
27866,Raj,It’s it’s not working dude.
27867,Sheldon,To success without Raj.
27868,Leonard,That’s too bad. But still working with kids it must be rewarding.
27869,Sheldon,I don’t understand. Yes we shared a uterus for nine months but since then we’ve pretty much gone our own separate ways.
27870,Raj,You guys kiss and hold hands.
27871,Sheldon,Yea who most people call Leo but he also answers to Lee remember that it’s important.
27872,Howard,He is so cool. Hey no hard feelings but I’m throwing my hypothetical bra at him.
27873,Raj,Maybe so. But you can’t incinerate a Bengal Tiger with a magnifying glass.
27874,Sheldon,No that’s not fair either.
27875,Raj,Now let’s do some sexy glamour shots. I’ll set the mood.  Oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz Yeah nice one oontz oontz. That’s right. Oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz oontz…
27876,Howard,Oh please you weigh 80 pounds. You don’t have a hammy.
27877,Raj,Okay cool.
27878,Penny,I did and he said he’ll get here when he gets here.
27879,Penny,Actually I’ve heard far too much about Schrodinger’s Cat.
27880,Leonard,Given her what?
27881,Leonard,Yes I did.
27882,Raj,Uh it’s hard to say. I think we’re good but things like this make me wonder if Emily’s really the right person for me. I mean did you guys ever have doubts about each other?
27883,Howard,And this is Howard.
27884,Penny,Wait a minute wait a minute you want to make a hair barrette with Bluetooth?
27885,Penny,Ooh I’m gonna check the fridge and see if there are any clues inside a beer.
27886,Leonard,Sheldon threw us all under the bus.
27887,Howard,Sheldon.
27888,Leonard,Oh. Well he waited in line for 14 hours while you napped in a lawn chair he got in a fight with a Klingon when he stepped out of line to pee and you wouldn’t wake up to vouch for him and worst of all he saw Star Trek Nemesis.
27889,Leonard,Uh-huh. Anyway I’m not sure she’s the best fit for our little how should we call it rebel alliance.
27890,Raj,It’s one of his best moves.
27891,Sheldon,MUON!
27892,Leonard,I did it last night I’m not doing it again.
27893,Leonard,Don’t tell Koothrappali. After you.
27894,Sheldon,Bosoms would not have said howdy in the fifteenth century. If anything they would have said “huzzah!”
27895,Leonard,I’m gonna get some coffee. You want some?
27896,Sheldon,Excuse me but I have some concerns about these questions.
27897,Leonard,Why does it have to be about anything? Can’t a fella ask his buddy to relocate no questions asked?
27898,Penny,Think it through Leonard.
27899,Penny,Why?
27900,Penny,Don’t look at me like that I tried.
27901,Raj,Uh actually if it’s not too much to ask could we have the Jewish girlfriend experience.
27902,Leonard,Oh Howard’s losing it. Check out his latest twitters. “I’m at the bottom of a black hole staring into the abyss. My life is meaningless my future is without hope.”
27903,Raj,That is so generous of you. I’d like to switch sides.
27904,Raj,Hey guys.
27905,Raj,If she isn’t gonna use it then why are we doing this?
27906,Howard,Well crime-scene photos near your crib spring to mind.
27907,Raj,Really? Because I’m dating two women is basically the only cool thing I can say about myself.
27908,Sheldon,You don’t need an Iron Man helmet. You’re not Iron Man.
27909,Howard,Oh they think we’re flanking they’re playing right into our hands. On the count of three we execute the flying scissor. One two…
27910,Howard,What do you mean not again?
27911,Sheldon,Oh no Morlocks? Eat him eat him. Aaaaargh.  Leonard!!!!!!!!
27912,Howard,Ooh we could have one of those retreats.
27913,Leonard,‘Cause there’s a lot of gorgeous blondes out there who don’t believe they can land a short nearsighted scientist. Let’s give them hope.
27914,Leonard,No no don’t ask.
27915,Sheldon,Oh I’m going with it. Marty and Doc never had have had brought the time machine to 2015. That means 2015 Biff could also not had have had brought the almanac to 1955 Biff. Therefore the timeline in which 1955 Biff gets the almanac is also the timeline in which 1955 Biff never gets the almanac. And not just never gets. Never have never hasn’t never had have hasn’t.
27916,Penny,So you can send it to Princeton and get your money back.
27917,Penny,You’re not the guy.
27918,Sheldon,Gentlemen we need to stop immediately.
27919,Sheldon,All right. It is a comfortable chair.
27920,Leonard,Gals? Who are you Fred Flintstone?
27921,Sheldon,Amy Farrah Fowler doesn’t believe in wearing costumes. She isn’t the free spirit I am.
27922,Sheldon,Met my childhood hero now I get to ride in an ambulance. Boy if we can get him to do that calendar this’ll be the best day ever.
27923,Penny,Oh my God I love this chicken.
27924,Penny,You look beautiful.
27925,Sheldon,I think I figured out Wolowitz’s magic trick and I need you to pick a card.
27926,Sheldon,I have such a profound sense of creation. I it’s like when I hatched sea monkeys except that this is from my DNA so this is like me monkeys.
27927,Sheldon,Really? You know I don’t like buying things at night. January 7th 2009 I went to the Ralph’s at 1130pm to pick up Cracklin’ Oat Bran for the morning and what did I see?
27928,Howard,You called it.
27929,Sheldon,Are you bringing flowers to a patient to cushion the blow of a terminal diagnosis? That wasn’t a joke.
27930,Penny,And then you got arrested.
27931,Leonard,Yes I now but…
27932,Sheldon,Okay.
27933,Leonard,Hey. We’re uh going to the movies.
27934,Sheldon,Really? I was thinking what we have now is a bit much.
27935,Sheldon,Slow down. Slow down please slow down.
27936,Leonard,Mm-hmm. Yep. I see nothing in this box but a wasted childhood.
27937,Sheldon,Clearly the combination of our DNA is exceptional. Our child could be the next step in the evolution of mankind. We’ll be able to get into any preschool we want!
27938,Leonard,I was thinking we could write a little app that would use handwriting recognition and then run it through a symbolic evaluation engine. You just use your smartphone take a picture of the equation and bam!
27939,Raj,I was thinking of dressing up as Indiana Jones’ mocha-skinned love child. Indian Jones.
27940,Sheldon,How many questions are too many questions?
27941,Leonard,Of course I like Amy.
27942,Sheldon,I’m trying to shoot.
27943,Leonard,Amy this is for you.
27944,Howard,What were you doing with Priya?
27945,Raj,Oh not just him you’re coming too.
27946,Raj,No we both have to be the same thing. Okay we’re ninjas.
27947,Leonard,Oh uh yeah. I got ’em on Amazon.
27948,Howard,Lack of confidence.
27950,Howard,Buzz Lightyear is not real.
27951,Raj,Dude everyone knows a time machine loses half its value the minute you drive it off the lot.
27952,Leonard,Isn’t that enough? It had the weaponised fruit and a puppet. What more do you want?
27953,Leonard,Like what?
27954,Penny,Oh God you know four years I lived with him four years that’s like as long as High School.
27956,Sheldon,I let you buy feminine hygiene products with my supermarket club card. You have any idea the kind of coupons I’m going to get in the mail now?
27957,Leonard,I I think I still have it.
27958,Penny,Right.
27959,Howard,Yeah. I’m getting all my exes together in order to discuss why they broke up with me and how I can be a better boyfriend.
27960,Howard,Uh w well okay look I I don’t want to lie to you. I got curious I was looking around and I broke the drawer on your night stand.
27961,Penny,Another night? Well I guess you can try but deep inside your heart you’ll know that laundry night is always Saturday night.
27962,Leonard,Uh.. b.. d.. uh.. uh..
27963,Leonard,How long should we stay?
27964,Penny,That’s funny. I learned something totally different.
27965,Penny,No Fritz I need you on my flank. No I don’t know German. Flankenzie flankenzie!
27966,Penny,What’s up?
27967,Sheldon,But I’m still working.
27968,Leonard,Wine? I didn’t say to give her wine.
27969,Raj,I guess I’m just more of a Pottery Barn Crate and Barrel kind of guy. Maybe Pier 1 if I really want to cut loose.
27970,Sheldon,Nothing. You seem to be implying an informational back channel between me and Penny where obviously none exists.
27971,Leonard,Great. What do you do?
27972,Leonard,Hadn’t really thought about it.
27973,Raj,That’s how we missed it.
27974,Howard,Because this one wants to marry me. I might never find another one who does.
27975,Penny,Well Leonard aren’t you going to do something?
27976,Raj,Okay the NASA Web site says Howard’s final descent has begun.
27977,Sheldon,I’m not sure it could go either way.
27978,Sheldon,Are you bothered that I can so easily manipulate you?
27979,Penny,Hey hey hey this is my paper. And my perspective is that slavery is bad. Oh and my professor’s black so I’m pretty sure that’s the right answer.
27980,Howard,It’s got a big bird on it dude.
27981,Sheldon,Sure you can you’re doing fine it’s very believable.
27982,Penny,No it isn’t.
27983,Raj,I love you too. We’re good.
27984,Sheldon,That could work.
27985,Penny,Really? Are you sure about that?
27986,Raj,I got a colossal serpent right here.
27987,Raj,All right. Shall we?
27988,Raj,I did. The guy at the liquor store said this stuff tastes great in coffee.
27989,Penny,I can’t it’ll break his heart. You know he’s always making an effort to do things with me he doesn’t enjoy like going outside.
27990,Sheldon,Thanks Mom.
27991,Sheldon,All right men we begin initial assembly and deployment of the testing equipment starting tomorrow at 0700 hours but until then you are all off duty. I suggest you keep the shenanigans to a minimum as medical help is 18 hours away by dogsled.
27993,Penny,Oh that means so much. I love you.
27994,Sheldon,All right. What were the symptoms?
27995,Penny,I don’t have hot dogs.
27996,Penny,No you’re right. No there’s there’s no plots no trucks no feet. So what other annoying habits shall we discuss?
27997,Leonard,Mom?
27998,Leonard,That’s Sheldon’s way of saying he’s proud of Bert too.
27999,Raj,What’s your mom going to say if you call off the wedding?
28000,Raj,Before Emily I was alone for so long. I just I don’t know if I can do that again.
28002,Howard,Can’t believe Bert has a girlfriend and I don’t.
28003,Raj,I had a great time last night.
28004,Howard,I’m a scientist. My ability to think is my bread and butter. I’m afraid if I take this I might lose that special unique something that makes me so successful in my field.
28005,Sheldon,Oh no! They sent the wrong Spock! Live long and suck it Zachary Quinto.
28006,Penny,Oh maybe a couple of virgin cuba libres that turned out to be kind of slutty.
28007,Sheldon,I’m deleting it.
28008,Leonard,Fine.
28009,Penny,Yeah we’re putting the play on for one night in this little 99-seat theatre. Can you come? Oh great. Do you know 98 other people that might want to come? Oh hang on.  Hello?
28010,Raj,Well I want information in order to improve myself.
28011,Sheldon,Swish.
28012,Sheldon,This would have worked out a lot better if you’d just told me you were going the office.
28013,Sheldon,The motion carries. Good day Amy Farrah Fowler.
28014,Howard,Did you pinky swear?
28015,Sheldon,Interesting. The world’s most boring liquid and the world’s most boring vegetable but you put ’em together and bleugh.
28016,Penny,Oh pthththth.
28017,Raj,I don’t want to go to Flatland.
28018,Penny,Come on I touched one onion ring.
28019,Leonard,Fellas. It’s been 30 minutes. Nobody’s touched each other.
28020,Leonard,Alicia what do you want as your default setting for DVDs 5.1 Dolby or DTS?
28021,Sheldon,Get off there.
28022,Howard,Nice place. Reminds me of my parents’ house back in New Delhi.
28023,Penny,– Oh.
28024,Sheldon,Have you learned anything?
28025,Sheldon,That I wouldn’t tell you the secret. Shhhhh!
28026,Leonard,I know but you guys make being a crappy friend look fun.
28027,Raj,Oh yeah? I love Ping-Pong.
28028,Penny,Mustache is looking good there Sheldon.
28029,Sheldon,She comes into my room. No-one’s supposed to be in my room.
28030,Howard,I’m so glad we could work this all out.
28031,Leonard,Hey we’re here.
28032,Howard,Half of it will be mine.
28033,Sheldon,And you never answered me. So who owes whom an apology now?
28034,Raj,Why didn’t girls like us in high school?
28035,Leonard,Well I sure as hell wasn’t going to bring it up before sex and during I was trying to remember what I read on google so…
28036,Raj,I could go for some goat.
28037,Sheldon,Your marriage is causing her pain? Yeah great I take it back. Go ahead and do it. Yay for love.
28038,Leonard,And before our next drive to Comic-Con I need the name of that juice.
28039,Leonard,Penny don’t.
28040,Leonard,No kidding you speak English really well.
28041,Penny,No no there’s no sowing no squeezing and no sucking face.
28042,Leonard,He said maybe we should enter you in the killer robot competition.
28043,Penny,Well wait. Don’t you want to know how I figured it out?
28044,Howard,They don’t call me Brown Dynamite for nothing.
28045,Penny,Going home where I won’t be interrogated like a criminal. I forgot my fortune cookie.
28046,Howard,Son of a bitch.
28047,Howard,Can you even eat those things?
28048,Sheldon,Of course not.
28049,Sheldon,No although it’s a question I’ve been pondering since preschool.
28050,Leonard,And you discover a secret door leading to a dark corridor.
28051,Penny,Okay fine. When’s the date?
28052,Howard,Not much. Nuked a burrito. Prayed to the Hindu god Urvashi that your bowels would loosen and your penis would droop like a willow tree.
28053,Raj,Dude I’m so sorry.
28054,Raj,I’d like to propose a toast to friends no matter how quirky.
28055,Sheldon,I came home early because they ran out of math to teach me.
28056,Leonard,No you’re not.
28057,Penny,That’s great. That shows a lot of integrity.
28058,Leonard,Yes thank you for all your help.
28059,Leonard,Yeah. Yeah I guess I am.
28060,Leonard,Well maybe not but some day we actually will be old and we’ll look back on this night and remember what a good time we had.
28061,Sheldon,But it’s mint in box.
28062,Sheldon,Here you go Meemaw. I made it just how you like a lot in a glass.
28063,Leonard,Come on is that really necessary?
28064,Leonard,Hello? What is this?
28065,Sheldon,Should I use the rest room or wait until we get home? Come on papa needs to void his bladder. Oh that’s not what you want to see after three buttermilks.
28066,Penny,I hope so.
28067,Penny,So that means I lose right? It’s over?
28068,Howard,Wait so Star Wars and Star Trek characters can go on the same branch?
28069,Howard,I can’t believe Sheldon gave this up.
28070,Raj,Space ice is no joke. I can’t even watch Frozen anymore.
28071,Sheldon,Very well. I’ll set the scene.
28072,Sheldon,No. But I knew that his yay was sarcastic. Not bad for a guy whose last bowel movement sounded like rain on a roof.
28073,Penny,He’s not some guy. He’s my friend.
28074,Howard,I’m in her head. Let the dance begin.
28075,Leonard,Oh thank God.
28076,Howard,Yeah i heard you on the baby monitor. Didn’t think you could think you could turn the theme from Walking Dead into a lullaby.
28077,Howard,Well that’s hard to hear but I’ll still take you back.
28078,Raj,May I have your attention please? We are hear tonight to celebrate the upcoming nuptials of my best friend Howard Wolowitz.
28079,Leonard,It upsets Sheldon when you play with the Sheldon.
28080,Sheldon,Leonard! Stop the car!
28081,Howard,You guys kiss and hold hands.
28082,Sheldon,Nothing. I just wanted to make Raj stop talking.
28083,Raj,Hmm. They must have left the tub on. Good thing I stopped by. Ah. Aaaaah! What are you doing here?
28084,Leonard,Huh. What is this?
28085,Sheldon,Leonard?
28086,Sheldon,Oh where are we going?
28087,Sheldon,Oh good I used that right. Anyway you’re aware that Leonard has entered into a new romantic relationship which includes a sexual component?
28088,Howard,Ooh limited edition. Nice.
28089,Penny,Well maybe I can do both.
28090,Sheldon,I’d say she’s copying you again but I’m getting tired of sitting in the hall.
28091,Sheldon,I like tangerine chicken I’m not getting tangerine chicken.
28092,Howard,Perfect for the night I’m having. Thank you.
28093,Penny,Fine go ahead.
28094,Leonard,You’re welcome. I just wanted to put that out there.
28095,Howard,They used to like going to the Mumbai Symphony but last year my mom thought they were phoning it in. Then my dad said based on their love life she should know about phoning it in.
28096,Sheldon,You’re making it too complicated. Why not stick to the basics? Go shopping for clothes while Leonard and I sit in those uncomfortable chairs and hold your purses hmm? I know I’d hate that. Leonard?
28097,Sheldon,I’ve never seen this show before and now I’m starting with episode 246? It’s unnatural.
28098,Raj,What are you guys up to?
28099,Sheldon,Wait uh uh hang on. In my defense…
28100,Sheldon,Oh good. Bye-bye.
28101,Leonard,So why haven’t we picked a date?
28102,Penny,Okay. Good night Leonard.
28103,Penny,Yes
28104,Howard,Oh grow up. I was lying. I lie all the time. Nobody wants to kiss me.
28105,Sheldon,Coffee.
28106,Sheldon, Go away bird.
28107,Raj,You got this buddy.
28108,Penny,Oh that gossipy bitch! No offense.
28109,Penny,So what do you guys do for fun around here?
28110,Leonard,What… .
28111,Sheldon,Oh. Well I guess it’s fixed.
28112,Sheldon,I know.
28113,Leonard,Sheldon that that’ll take us all night.
28114,Penny,No no I didn’t say better I said less stained.
28115,Leonard,What secret. Tell me the secret.
28116,Howard,Oh okay okay my turn. Are you in the six Star Wars movies?
28117,Sheldon,What’s the bad news?
28118,Leonard,No but actually that was this guy’s sister.
28119,Sheldon,And stronger. Who wants to see me beat up the bartender?
28120,Leonard,So are we still taking things slow? Because a gunshot wound today last week I slammed my thumb in the kitchen drawer. We don’t know how much time I have.
28121,Leonard,Anyway I figured I can hang out with my friends and have fun too.
28123,Penny,Okay fine. Look look I’m calling her now! See?
28124,Sheldon,Yeah that’s the problem it’s too big.
28125,Leonard,Calling 911.
28126,Sheldon,Penny if you wouldn’t mind I’d like to have a conversation about girls.
28127,Leonard,Yeah that must get old quick.
28128,Leonard,I don’t think so.
28129,Raj,Of course you have. They’re an engineer’s dream. Anything you can design a 3-D printer can make out of plastic.
28130,Leonard,Uh no reason. I just think it’s sexier when things are left to the imagination.
28131,Leonard,You know what? I’m not driving you to work because you’re incredibly annoying.
28132,Penny,Let’s forget the toy thing okay? Um maybe…
28133,Sheldon,Really? Oh that’s fantastic. Now wait they’re dropping. Why are they dropping?
28134,Penny,It’s not the wig.
28135,Leonard,Yeah we came to talk to Zack. Hey Zack.
28136,Howard,Yeah I know you’re teasing but watch out for karma.
28137,Sheldon,Your shoes are delightful. Where did you get them?
28138,Leonard,Oh. Okay. But before you say anything have you ever heard of Schrodinger’s Cat?
28139,Raj,Okay. Please. So uh you you have tattoos?
28140,Penny,Of course not. No one ever says they don’t like you straight to your face.
28141,Sheldon,Indeed. Nothing sours a friendship more than over-familiarity with someone’s toilet routine.
28142,Penny,What?
28143,Sheldon,Penny! If I’m going to buy Leonard a gift I’m going to do it right. I refuse to let him experience the same childhood trauma I did.
28144,Sheldon,Bring Penny to meet Mandy.
28145,Penny,Now let’s assume by some miracle you actually catch a fish. You’re going to have to know how to gut it. So what you’re going to do is you’re going to take your knife slice him right up the belly.  You want me to stop?
28146,Raj,Okay everybody and plie. And relevae.
28147,Sheldon,Hello. Penny this is not a good time. No I told you you’re not prepared for the Sanctum of Burning Souls. You need to be in a group of at least five for that quest and one should be a level 35 healer. Penny I can’t log on and help you. We’ll talk when I get home.  I’m not getting the computing time am I?
28148,Raj,Uh you have to take the pin out.
28149,Sheldon,Aw now I’m sad I didn’t hear it.
28150,Penny,There’s nothing to be brave about. Everything’s fine.
28151,Howard,Shame on all of you.
28152,Sheldon,I thought I didn’t have a problem.
28153,Howard,Well if that’s the case is there anything I can do to help?
28154,Leonard,How could I not be sure?
28155,Sheldon,My queen can now take your rook from below.
28156,Sheldon,Leonard she’s doing it again.
28157,Howard,Thank you. Oh and I’d like for at least one of us to see some action so if you guys happen to have sex it’s cool if she stays in the room.
28158,Sheldon,Forget your suit look at my arms waving I’m like a flamingo on Ritalin.
28159,Sheldon,That seems a fairly efficient arrangement.
28160,Sheldon,Oh yes born alone die alone. It’s a tragic human condition. Now Raj if you’ll excuse my mother she’s about to make a pecan pie that’ll be so good I’ll almost forget how she blew it with the fried chicken.
28161,Leonard,He thinks there’s a difference.
28162,Penny,I know but you did throw up. Isn’t that a sign of a concussion?
28163,Leonard,Thank you. Bye.
28164,Sheldon,Superb. This morning I made a palindrome with my Alpha-Bits. Nice hat Bob Tahecin.
28165,Leonard,I thought we agreed this was all Koothrappali’s fault.
28166,Sheldon,That’s strange. That he would come to you for that and not me. Oh I got two emails from him. Do you have Leonard’s email address? And. Never mind I found it. I can’t believe he picked you over me.
28167,Leonard,Hey Penny… and Stuart hey Stuart.
28168,Leonard,You mean my hypothesis. I hypothesized it all by myself.
28169,Sheldon,Do you know any card tricks?
28170,Leonard,Ah I’d love to but I’m supposed to hang out with Penny.
28171,Sheldon,Is anyone else troubled by the Spider-Man theme song?
28172,Penny,Coming coming. Hey nice knees.
28173,Sheldon,You call tech support.
28174,Leonard,Separating my delicates.
28175,Raj,If you want to chase after her chase after her.
28176,Leonard,What are you talking about?
28177,Penny,Hey is Sheldon here?
28178,Raj,Okay yes I will err on the side of caution and defrost a fresh batch.
28179,Sheldon,My expenses account for 46.9% of my after-tax income. The rest is divvied up between a small savings account this deceptive container of peanut brittle and the hollowed-out buttocks of a superhero action figure who shall remain nameless for his own protection. Or her own protection. Take some.
28180,Penny,Oh there it is again! You think I’m stupid!
28181,Leonard,God I hope not. And no I’m not Princess Leia.
28182,Howard,Come on we’re smart guys. We can figure this out.
28183,Leonard,Honey you only had like three lines. That wasn’t gonna happen anyway.
28184,Sheldon,Amy the Daleks are right on my tail quick we need to reset the time circuits. Oh no I left my sonic screwdriver behind.
28185,Sheldon,I was going to mention it at the time but then I thought some day this might be a teachable moment.
28186,Leonard,Star Trek. You know the Neutral Zone between the Federation and the Romulan Empire.
28187,Penny,All right.
28188,Sheldon,Um…
28189,Leonard,What?
28190,Sheldon,Oh this day just keeps getting better.
28191,Leonard,No but when we show this nonsense to Sheldon it will make him crazy and he’ll have to fix it.
28192,Sheldon,Alfred knows that Barbara Gordon is Batgirl. Which I’ve now just told to Batman. See I can’t keep a secret.
28193,Raj,Hey we’ve always talked about playing together.
28194,Sheldon,Yes I’d like a seven-day course of penicillin some uh syrup of ipecac to induce vomiting and a mint.
28195,Sheldon,The answer is one simple test away. Hmm? You know it’s like when I thought there was a possum in my closet. Did I sit around wondering? No I sent Leonard in with a pointy stick and a bag.
28196,Howard,So then I went to Cambridge which was wonderful not only because it’s a good school but because it totally looks like Hogwarts. That’s where I fell in love with astronomy and now I’m an astrophysicist at Caltech so I guess you could say uh Raj is my name and stars are my game. And rhyming is also my game. So uh two games. Uh anyway that that’s enough about me. I want to hear everything about you.
28197,Sheldon,Great thank you. Oh that’s terrific.
28198,Sheldon,What if each of those people let someone cut?
28199,Sheldon,You think this is fast? It’s just a matter of time before I see Amy’s leg stubble in my shower.
28200,Penny,Honey I’m a little strapped for cash this year so for Christmas I was thinking of giving you this.
28201,Sheldon,Kripke you know of all the people Barry Kripke. I’m so… Are you folding that like a crazy person to get me to do it for you?
28202,Leonard,What if you could make Kripke look even sillier than he made you look?
28203,Raj,Okay look. Instead of trying to reinforce this structure here what if we just ran another line bypass it entirely?
28204,Penny,They have them every week.
28205,Sheldon,Although that number would be fairly easy to calculate.
28206,Leonard,That sounds really fun.
28207,Leonard,Watch whatever you want.
28208,Leonard,I’m lactose intolerant.
28209,Raj,Okay the NASA Web site says Howard’s final descent has begun.
28210,Leonard,You know I’m sure if you just apologised to Gablehauser he would give you your job back.
28211,Leonard,Hey.
28212,Leonard,No I can’t. I’m playing Grand Theft Auto later. Look I’m no expert in women.
28213,Sheldon,That’s a craving. That’s a sign of chemical dependency.
28214,Leonard,Well with the exception of string theory not much has happened since the 1930’s and you can’t prove string theory at best you can say “hey look my idea has an internal logical consistency.”
28215,Sheldon,Give me the eraser.
28216,Raj,And over here is Sheldon.
28217,Leonard,No no I didn’t mean to go into your apartment to… go fast.
28218,Leonard,What could she possibly be talking about for so long?
28219,Sheldon,You’re being impossible.
28220,Leonard,Oh well then you’ll enjoy this. Bernadette does the same thing with you and Koothrappali.
28221,Penny,Say hi to Emily for us.
28222,Penny,What?
28223,Sheldon,Well you’re in luck there’s a mixer here in Flatland. Oh look there’s a sexually attractive line segment you should chat her up.
28224,Leonard,Mmm. My pleasure.
28225,Leonard,What? No.
28226,Leonard,His girlfriend.
28227,Penny,Well Raj can’t talk to me unless he’s drunk and Wolowitz is you know disgusting.
28228,Howard,This sucks.
28229,Sheldon,Now this isn’t about us this is about what’s best for the asteroid.
28230,Sheldon,Oh that is much better. Yeah boy if good ideas came out of your brain the way mucus comes out of your nose we’d be in good shape.
28231,Penny,Fine Howard is being mean to you for no reason.
28232,Leonard,I know and it was the greatest sarcastic quip I’ve ever heard.
28233,Howard,You know I I’ve been thinking that maybe meeting somebody one-on-one is too intense so Friday night my friends are having a party.
28234,Howard,You’re not wrong about Fruit Stripe. I was always a Hubba Bubba man.
28235,Leonard,In the bathroom.
28236,Sheldon,Oh of course he is. She’s very interesting. Did you know when she was 14 she severed the webbing between her own toes?
28237,Howard,Interesting. Penny’s current suitor asking advice from her former suitor.
28238,Sheldon,I’m on the horns of a dilemma. Can you imagine me Sheldon Cooper at the North Pole?
28239,Sheldon,I’m sure she did.
28240,Sheldon,Yes. What is there a problem?
28241,Sheldon,Hold that thought Leonard a moment.
28242,Penny,No no no. You know they have suffered enough. Everybody’s suffered enough. The thing is you’re going to have to offer him a face-saving way out of this.
28243,Leonard,You had some nice moves out there Howard.
28244,Penny,I’m gonna kill her.
28245,Howard,You are but you’ve got kind of a big personality with your flashy clothes and your Woody Allen swagger.
28246,Leonard,Hey.
28247,Sheldon,Hey it’s true Kripke lacks the basic social skills that we take for granted but he also controls the new open science grid computer that I need to use to run some simulations of structure formation in the early universe.
28248,Sheldon,Oh Leonard I have something for you. Per our roommate agreement this is your 24-hour notice that I will be having a non-related female spending two nights in our apartment.
28249,Sheldon,Oh it’s fine. You needed a suitcase I wasn’t home you borrowed a suitcase.
28250,Penny,I’m sorry. He doesn’t really understand sarcasm.
28251,Sheldon,I didn’t punch him. He turned around and I gave him a Captain Kirk karate chop. I’m not even sure he knows I did it.
28252,Leonard,Same as when we lost you at the zoo.
28253,Sheldon,It’s not my apartment.
28254,Leonard,He’s practicing.
28255,Leonard,Do not tell Wolowitz.
28256,Penny,You’re joking right?
28257,Leonard,The walls are getting slower.
28258,Howard,Dude! Everybody left an hour ago! Surprise!
28259,Sheldon,Excellent! It’s in a cul-de-sac. We can box him in.
28260,Sheldon,Not important. Your sugar was a little high. I’d follow up with your regular physician. In the meantime I have some paperwork here for you to go over.
28261,Leonard,Are you even listening to me?
28262,Sheldon,Well?
28263,Raj,He is so afraid of his feelings.
28264,Sheldon,I have to skip the chitchat. Emergency.
28266,Sheldon,Priya?
28267,Penny,No you made that for you I want you to have it.
28268,Sheldon,Good Lord what have I done?
28269,Leonard,I don’t get how she can just announce that an old boyfriend is going to be sleeping on her couch.
28270,Howard,The lead in The Hunger Games is a woman. Marvel has made Tor a female.
28271,Sheldon,Thank you. Now yell charge and we can get out of here.
28272,Howard,How’s that going?
28273,Leonard,Wha… how did it get on the internet?
28274,Howard,Hey. Emily right?
28275,Sheldon,Space-time can be interpreted as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.
28276,Leonard,What you mean like your massive credit card debt?
28277,Penny,Oh God.
28278,Sheldon,Did I misspeak about the ring?
28279,Penny,You look like a talking cupcake.
28280,Sheldon,Hey I shared my Honey Nut Cheerios with you.
28281,Leonard,No I’m sorry. I really am. It’s not right to mock what a person believes in.
28282,Leonard,Yeah I’m sorry it’s been broken.
28283,Sheldon,Thanks for bringing me home.
28284,Raj,Thank you. I apprec….  apprec…. appreeee…. oh-oh.
28285,Penny,Oh no what happened?
28286,Leonard,It’ll be okay. It’ll be okay.
28287,Leonard,Wow.
28288,Leonard,That was to keep my muscles from sagging. Can we please stop talking about this?
28289,Leonard,I thought the movie was about 18th-century Vienna?
28290,Raj,It’s funny because bread sounds like dead.
28292,Leonard,Oh sorry. This wedding just reminds me of my kinda-sorta girlfriend 9000 miles away.
28293,Leonard,Because he’s hard to find. If he was easy to find the books would be called There’s Waldo.
28294,Penny,Well I hope not. I just hate when people play those kinds of games.
28295,Penny,Oh hey I didn’t know they still made corduroy suits!
28296,Penny,Yeah drive safe. We love you. And give us a call… Oh my God it was me it was me. I’m the one who blabbed she was pregnant!
28297,Leonard,No that’s a crazy thing.
28298,Sheldon,Strap on a pair? Of what skates?
28299,Howard,And you’re afraid it’ll do a better job than you?
28300,Howard,Please my pleasure.
28301,Leonard,It’s not Simon Says.
28302,Raj,Sixty seconds. This is not looking good.
28303,Sheldon,I don’t think that’s a good idea.
28304,Raj,Maybe there are other things we have in common. Come dinnertime do you enjoy eating food?
28305,Leonard,Uh not bad. You remember when we used to have sex and you said that it didn’t mean anything it was just for fun?
28306,Leonard,Nice shot.
28307,Leonard,Sorry Stuart.
28308,Sheldon,The wand is called showmanship and the beep is none of your business. Oh! Excuse me I’m getting a text message completely unrelated to this magic trick. Oh look my dry cleaning’s ready. And your card was the five of spades. Ta-da.
28309,Sheldon,Yes exactly.
28310,Howard,Okay the NASA Web site says Howard’s final descent has begun.
28311,Howard,No think about it. We make it an experiment. Like when Frankenstein’s monster was lonely and he found a wife.
28312,Leonard,Why not?
28313,Howard,Just say it.
28314,Sheldon,Top desk drawer.
28315,Penny,Okay let’s do this um I will drive Sheldon to get a present and Howard you need to get rid of Leonard for about two hours.
28316,Sheldon,Yeah I think so. I just restocked the old PRK.
28317,Raj,Stop knocking! It’s open! Please tell my parents that our dark matter research is at a critical juncture and I can’t come home for my cousin Sanjay’s wedding.
28318,Leonard,Uh nice guy. But it was a little weird to hear Batman say don’t ring the doorbell or my poodles will go crazy.
28319,Howard,You should have told him to mind his own business.
28320,Howard,Okay well can we imply that you’re well-endowed?
28321,Raj,The Indian sex book. In other words if you wonder wonder who wrote the book of love it was us.
28322,Sheldon,How can you be late I wasn’t expecting you at all.
28323,Leonard,Sheldon don’t make that noise it’s disrespectful.
28324,Sheldon,What about this one?
28325,Sheldon,But you have to make a motion to put it on agenda.
28326,Penny,What? That’s a real thing? What is it Star Wars Christmas?
28327,Sheldon,Oh. That’s just as well. They had me on hold for 20 minutes and I hung up.  Leonard? Also Wolowitz invited us all to dinner so I’m ready whenever you are.
28328,Sheldon,What’s the difference?
28329,Sheldon,Oh I didn’t think of Iron Man. You know maybe after myself and I have dinner we can meet you two for dessert.
28330,Leonard,Sheldon six bucks.
28331,Raj,Well this is kind of anti-climactic.
28332,Penny,I didn’t mean to. It just slipped out in front of her assistantone day. I…
28333,Penny,I don’t know what to say.
28334,Sheldon,Because you keep saying who.
28335,Sheldon,Based on your academic record any number of things I would imagine.
28336,Leonard,Yes.
28337,Howard,Hey so what did you guys think of the new episode of Caprica last night?
28338,Raj,You didn’t ask her out but that was a lot of sounds.
28339,Leonard,Are you drunk?
28340,Sheldon,Do you want me to withdraw my application?
28341,Sheldon,He is referring of course to third class on Indian Railways’ magnificent Ranakpur Express and its twelve hundred kilometer journey from Maharashtra to the Bikaner Junction.
28342,Sheldon,Wolowitz is trying to outflank us. Let out some string add altitude and I’ll go under and cut his line.
28343,Leonard,Take the bus.
28344,Raj,If you do not stop hitting on my lady you will feel the full extent of my wrath.
28345,Raj,I’m counting that as foreplay.
28346,Raj,It’s a little early isn’t it?
28347,Leonard,A tradition of hunts full of puzzles that rely on logic and obscure knowledge science.
28348,Leonard,Earl grey?
28349,Leonard,What about it Howard?
28350,Raj,All right um how about oh how about Rocket Man?
28351,Penny,You know what screw them. Our night is going to be way more special than theirs.
28352,Raj,Great. Lost boys children of the night. Got it. Can you pass the Chex mix please. Thank you. We are lost boys.
28353,Sheldon,You don’t jog.
28354,Howard,Oh sure.
28355,Leonard,Why didn’t you say something?
28356,Leonard,Hey.
28357,Sheldon,Not literally. But as far back as the 17th century scientists observed a 33-day fluctuation in men’s hormone levels.
28358,Leonard,Excuse me?
28359,Penny,Well where the hell’s the coin?
28360,Sheldon,Certainly. I’ve run from bullies dogs angry chickens and one particularly persistent P.E. teacher determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test.
28361,Penny,Hey Sheldon!
28362,Sheldon,And a third person. It’s three-person chess. I must say ever since you started having regular intercourse your mind has lost its keen edge. You should reflect on that.
28363,Penny,Amy’s got some news.
28364,Sheldon,Hu-u-u-uh…. Hu-u-u-uh!
28365,Raj,Oh no that’s mine.
28366,Raj,You know it. Oo-ah oo-ah.
28367,Howard,Can’t you just enjoy the wonder Sheldon? Why must you peek behind the curtain? Or up the butt?
28368,Leonard,I’m so sorry.
28369,Sheldon,He’s right.
28370,Howard,Is that enough to melt the lug nut?
28371,Raj,You have no idea. They buy me a new BMW for my birthday but can I get seat warmers? No. Rajesh if you want a warm butt you’re gonna have to pay for it yourself. Well maybe I will old man.
28372,Penny,Yeah sure. Just yesterday she asked why is Howard hiding under the table?
28373,Sheldon,Of course.
28374,Sheldon,Ugh let it go. I have heard that my whole life. Every time something upsets me somebody says let it go you know like it’s my fault and it’s not okay to feel the way I feel.
28375,Leonard,Yeah?
28376,Penny,Well hang on. Maybe the Chinese haven’t finished watching it yet.
28377,Leonard,Sheldon what do I need to quote Spock’s dying words to you.
28379,Leonard,Sheldon we have to get out of here.
28380,Sheldon,Um as you know several weeks ago in our first encounter we may have gotten off on the wrong foot when I called you an idiot. And I just wanted to say that I was wrong. To point it out.
28381,Howard,Oh okay. Good. I don’t need more comics. Howard’s gonna stop by we’re gonna play intergalactic battleship and Indian Monopoly.
28382,Howard,Totally. What’s wrong with cap sleeves? If you have the right figure for it they’re adorable.
28383,Sheldon,What?
28384,Sheldon,I am asserting in the event that Batman’s death proves permanent that original Robin Dick Grayson is the logical successor to the Bat Cowl.
28385,Leonard,Okay.
28386,Howard,Hey guys bad news. I just did a quick calculation. Given the size of the theatre  and the length of this line we might not get seats.
28387,Penny,Well what’d he say?
28388,Sheldon,Well count me out.
28389,Howard,Hmm. I’m doing okay and I was very popular at 13.
28390,Raj,What took you so long?
28391,Leonard,Oh you do what you want but I don’t want to lose my friends over tenure. Friends are forever.
28392,Sheldon,Penny would be the entree. Then Leonard’s basically a cheese course. And because I love you you’re dessert.
28393,Sheldon,Really?
28394,Leonard,No no no. Wait don’t go. Just let me explain. We’re physicists and we’re trying to prove a hypothesis that we’ve been working on for over a year.
28395,Sheldon,Not for you!
28396,Penny,Well leaving an envelope full of cash on my dresser after sex would count as weird.
28397,Sheldon,I’ll show you.  Everyody cut footloose. Nope.
28398,Leonard,Where are we going?
28399,Leonard,Uh Theodore how long are you planning to stay exactly?
28400,Howard,I’m telling you if xenon emits ultraviolet light then those dark matter discoveries must be wrong.
28401,Leonard,Congratulations Sheldon. You win office.
28402,Sheldon, Mother?
28403,Raj,It’s sad that you know that.
28404,Sheldon,Well a lot it’s very annoying. Has something changed? Um is there something that you’re not telling me?
28405,Penny,So what do you think?
28406,Raj,I thought he might be a little more excited.
28407,Raj,Okay.
28408,Penny,Hmm.
28409,Sheldon,Well no no no no no no no. You have to like each other. Well we have a 430 reservation at Applebee’s.
28410,Sheldon,I taught her that.
28412,Leonard,Good good. Everything okay between you two?
28413,Penny,Sheldon what are you doing with maxi pads?
28414,Sheldon,Hello everyone. I I’d like to apologize for my behaviour. I hope it hasn’t put a damper on the party. So please enjoy yourselves. Oh this is quickly getting out of hand.
28415,Leonard,Sheldon get out of my way.
28416,Sheldon,Good to see you again Mr. Stephen-Hawking Liked-Our-Paper.
28417,Howard,Just tell me which one you think is more manly. This hockey jersey or this football jersey.
28418,Penny,Well you know it’s the Cheesecake Factory. People order cheesecake and I bring it to them.
28419,Sheldon,I’m glad you asked. Amy you have a confetto in your nose. No no no no. Other side. There you go.
28420,Sheldon,That is a valid point. Perhaps we should establish some ground rules.
28421,Raj,A little loud dude.
28422,Sheldon,Who is it?
28423,Penny,Yeah come on tell us more.
28424,Sheldon,Well I think I have a nice 2009 AnaMantle HC. It’s usually indicated for acutely inflamed haemorrhoids but it also goes nicely with non mucosal body parts.
28425,Sheldon,Well my mother used to make me this split pea with little frankfurter slices and these home made croutons.
28426,Sheldon,Who.
28427,Penny,Yeah.
28428,Sheldon,And last but not least this is one that I like to call Star Wars Toast because it has a light side and a dark side. All righty it’s time for Dungeons & Dragons.
28429,Raj,You sure? It’s a pretty great wall.
28430,Penny,What?
28431,Howard,Got it.
28432,Leonard,Anyway Stephen Hawking’s team is looking into that and I’ve been invited to join them.
28433,Howard,Now we are done.
28434,Sheldon, Leonard?
28435,Howard,Okay so we know that previous attempts to send a message into space like the Golden Record on Voyager were heavily criticized.
28436,Raj,I’m sweating already.
28437,Leonard,That doesn’t sound right. My research has shown that it takes three to five years of shameless begging.
28438,Leonard,Nancy. You called me Nancy for three years.
28439,Sheldon,Remarkable. In just under a half hour 200 metric tons of fuel will ignite in a controlled explosion right beneath Howard’s keister. And all from a country whose entire contribution to the global economy has been Tetris and mail-order brides.
28440,Sheldon,The TV is gone.
28441,Penny,Sheldon it’s Saturday night you’ll be doing laundry.
28442,Sheldon,Well I assume you’re not referring to digestive regularity? Because I’ve come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate.
28443,Sheldon,Because the truth made me look bad whereas a ridiculous bald-faced lie makes me look good. Anyway if Kripke asks tell him my coitus with Amy is frequent intense and whimsically inventive.
28444,Leonard,No.
28445,Leonard,Will the gentleman from the great state of denial yield for a question?
28446,Leonard,Well he’s smart and crazy enough he may have actually created a monster. 
28447,Sheldon,Here. You’re sad so I made you tea.
28448,Leonard,Waking up wondering which one of those fans stole our wallets.
28449,Sheldon,You know what? I’m going back to I told you so. I told you so.
28450,Raj,Yeah but now you make me wonder what’s wrong with you.
28451,Sheldon,Oh yes. In the world of emoticons I was colon capital D.
28452,Penny,Oh then you all can get tenure.
28454,Howard,Why don’t we take him to see the Blue Man Group?
28455,Howard,No I’m not jealous. All right I’d kill a hobo if it’ll get me laid. Now can we order?
28456,Raj,Oh no. At home. The servants would sing to me laugh at my jokes. I wish I knew their names.
28457,Leonard,Uh let’s see. Yup 30 pieces of silverware.
28458,Howard,Oh I miss her already.
28459,Leonard,That’s not it because you’re clearly upset.
28460,Sheldon,Get him out.
28461,Sheldon,Yes but whoever’s her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of experience and not to mention that fact that sh…. 
28462,Leonard,I stand corrected.
28463,Leonard,We’re home.
28464,Raj,One of them broke up with you. Do you really want her telling the other one why?
28465,Howard,You see behind the fountain that tower that looks like a pyramid? It’s called a Sikhara. It symbolizes the the connection between the human and the divine.
28466,Leonard,Get up we can’t lose at math.
28468,Penny,You know once I proposed to him.
28469,Leonard,What if they were mobsters who slept with the fishes?
28470,Howard,And he’s picking the tomatoes out of his salad just like I do. I always did feel a connection with him. Oh I have got an idea.
28471,Penny,Yeah i remember us driving up there going to the winery and that’s it.
28472,Leonard,Oh good.
28473,Leonard,Really that’s a lot of work and it’s kind of late.
28474,Raj,You realize you can’t win.
28475,Howard,Okay uh please don’t take this the wrong way but I’d rather swim buck-naked across the Ganges with a paper cut on my nipple and die a slow agonizing death from a viral infection than work with you.
28476,Penny,Leonard.
28477,Sheldon,Hey let’s not pull at that thread. Okay. I’ll fight SpongeBob because he’s so friendly we’ll just end up tickling each other. Um I’ll befriend the seal because he’s trainable which is the problem I’m having with my current friends. Which means I’ll have to eat the hagfish.
28478,Howard,Answer the question what are you doing here?
28479,Howard,Howard get out.
28480,Penny,And there was no-one there to take care of you?
28481,Leonard,This is it.
28482,Howard,Hey guys. Mind if Emily joins us for lunch?
28483,Penny,I think Leonard’s mom’s okay with me.
28484,Penny,You’re dating somebody who is it?
28485,Leonard,That Raj’ll be on it before we make it to the freeway?
28486,Leonard,Oh right. Ladies and gentlemen our guest of honour Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
28487,Leonard,Stan Lee does not have a contagious skin disease.
28488,Leonard,Hi.
28489,Sheldon,Of course you did. It was a fun and practical way of organizing your school work. But the bullies took it from us. Well no more. Tonight we take back our dignity our birthright and our pride. What do you say? Who’s with me?
28490,Sheldon,I want grilled cheese.
28491,Leonard,How does he get the helium?
28492,Leonard,Don’t worry. They only stay on your record for a year.
28493,Leonard,Will you tell him he’s out of his mind.
28494,Leonard,Please let it go Sheldon.
28495,Penny,So relax. We’re happy to have you.
28496,Raj,Hey what’s your problem?
28497,Penny,Okay let’s go through this one more time. Just because Leonard has a new girlfriend does not mean I need to go out and hook up with some guy.
28498,Penny,Having a little trouble catching your breath there?
28500,Howard,Do not tell me about my own culture Sheldon! In the mood I’m in I’ll take you out I swear to cow!
28501,Sheldon,This is not my laundry.
28502,Leonard,A favour? Sure you can ask me a favour I would do you a favour for you.
28503,Leonard,You still got the part. That’s a huge accomplishment.
28504,Howard,How can you be embarrassed around me? I’m gonna be in the room with you when you give birth.
28505,Penny,Okay can I ask you something? Why do you like making us do this stuff?
28506,Howard,Hey uh thanks for keeping me company.
28507,Howard,Smooth.
28508,Leonard,Yes we did Kripke.
28509,Leonard,Oh yeah.
28510,Sheldon,Hello.
28511,Sheldon,Yeah way ahead of you. I will play the word at for two measly points throwing the game and thus securing my friendship with the smartest man in the world.
28512,Howard,I forbid it.
28513,Penny,Oh alright. I will give you my bed on one condition. That you promise to zip your hole for the next eight hours.
28514,Leonard,So is it everything you hoped it would be?
28515,Penny,I found these in the dryer. I’m assuming they belong to Sheldon.
28516,Penny,Okay look here’s something people do not know about me. When I first moved out to L.A. I did a topless scene in a low-budget horror movie about a killer gorilla. Ugh! After I did it I felt so ashamed. Thankfully that thing never came out.
28517,Leonard,This is ridiculous. Dammit Sheldon snap out of it. You’re a physicist you belong at the University doing research not hiding in your room. 
28518,Sheldon,It’s eleven am.
28520,Sheldon,You’re tricking me. You tell me the truth what do we get?
28521,Penny,Okay so she drops off a five hundred dollar gift and she’s not trying to get back together with you?
28523,Sheldon,I know.
28524,Sheldon,Good to know? What’s that supposed to mean?
28525,Sheldon,Well sure.
28526,Sheldon,Ah the talking cure. Classical Freudian good choice. If it will help speed things along uh my answers to the standard Rorschach ink blot test are A a bat B a bat C a bat and D my father killing my mother with a hypodermic needle.
28527,Penny,Okay you’re kind of really great.
28528,Howard,Thank you for saying that. Next to buying things that is the best part about having money.
28529,Sheldon,Anyway I wanted to apologize. I am truly sorry.
28530,Raj,Enjoy Oxnard. I’m sure your daughter’s looking forward to having you.
28531,Howard,Great. I bought her a couple of drinks and she gave me her e-mail address.
28532,Sheldon,Well-groomed vampires meet in pairs and shave each other. Case closed.
28533,Penny,Don’t worry I won’t look.
28534,Leonard,No! No no! I wasn’t going to say any of that. I was just going to say I really like you.
28535,Leonard,What’s going on with your dad?
28536,Leonard,Is that Howard in front of us?
28537,Sheldon,Oh!
28538,Leonard,Hi. Again.
28540,Leonard,Yeah that sounds right.
28541,Sheldon,No thank you. Delivery men are the unsung foot soldiers of our nation’s commerce. It’s because of people like you people like me can limit our human contact. I’d shake your hand but well you know.
28542,Penny,You know I think this is one of those things where talking about it is not going to make it better. Want a glass of wine?
28543,Leonard,But what if Man-Man dressed as a bat?
28544,Sheldon,Dear Lord are you still going to be here on French Toast Day?
28545,Penny,Really nothing?
28546,Penny,Okay well can we go talk in the living room?
28547,Sheldon,Oh by the way thank you for the delicious cocoa.
28548,Penny,Yes like a museum but anything else.
28550,Sheldon,Alright. Goodnight.
28551,Sheldon,Mr. Jeffries I need to show you something. 1411446
28552,Raj,You were in the middle of an erection.
28553,Penny,Yeah until someone left him in the drugstore parking lot and he freaked out.
28554,Leonard,Mm. Well I think more about if I’d have any regrets.
28555,Sheldon,No Bernadette don’t be a hero!
28556,Leonard,If the word is pee-pee just do it.
28557,Sheldon,I didn’t say it was fascinating I said it was noteworthy.
28558,Raj,Yeah anything is better than this.
28559,Sheldon,Gentlemen this is the Coast Starlight one of the great American trains operating on one of the classic American routes. On this side you’ll see panoramic ocean vistas inaccessible to any other form of transportation while on your side you’ll be treated to 350 miles of CostCos Jiffy Lubes and cinderblock homes with above-ground pools.
28560,Howard,Well you should be ’cause she was looking good.
28561,Penny,Oh he had to leave.
28562,Leonard,You think you should call Amy?
28563,Sheldon,They make up a non-Newtonian fluid which is liquid but solid under the percussive action of the speaker.
28564,Sheldon,Oh come on! Why not?
28565,Penny,Aren’t you worried you’re making French toast on oatmeal day?
28566,Leonard,‘Kay.
28567,Howard,Give it up dude you’re arguing with a crazy person.
28568,Sheldon,But it wasn’t my fault. I didn’t exclude him. And I didn’t write the article.
28569,Raj,Fifteen seconds.
28570,Raj,Oh that would be a good way to go.
28571,Sheldon,Because you want to start watching it right now. Copy that. Let’s see. Up next on the tenure committee is Professor Wu. Well get ready for the complete works of Jackie Chan.
28572,Penny,Hey why did you get two? I’m with stupid.
28573,Sheldon,Thank you you are a good citizen. Told you. Go ahead throw my underwear out the window. Same thing’s gonna happen.
28574,Sheldon,Well uh Penny is on her way to perform in a one night showcase production of Rent which we are unable to attend because we are going to a symposium on molecular positronium given by Dr Emile Farminfarmian.
28575,Leonard,Sheldon I accept your apology but you upset a lot of people while you were sick. I’m not in a position to just say you can come.
28576,Leonard,Schnapps. You’re right that is fun.
28577,Leonard,Or as you probably call it back home food.
28578,Sheldon,It’s called Scientists. Now I will name three scientists then you will put them in order of the size of their contribution to their respective fields. To make this game even more compelling you must consider only the contribution of the man to the field not the validity of the field itself. For example Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayn made a greater contribution to the discredited field of alchemy than Halbert Vanderplatt made to neurobiology. Okay ready to have some fun?
28579,Leonard,Sheldon!
28580,Raj,Really? Then what were you doing at the comic book store that night?
28581,Sheldon,Of course.
28582,Raj,Are you still going to tell him about you-know-who?
28583,Howard,Is it bad? Did you hear something? Oh my God. It’s bad. Somebody kill me.
28584,Sheldon,Of course I do. I don’t want that Swedish team scooping us.
28585,Sheldon,I can if you’d just roll over and accept your fate.
28586,Sheldon,Too bad. I’m coming with you.
28587,Sheldon,Well you’re a physicist not a circus clown.
28588,Leonard,Whatcha doin’?
28589,Sheldon,I’m not being stupid. I’m employing the work of Dutch researcher Mirjam Tuk who found that people with full bladders make better decisions.
28590,Howard,Don’t do that in socks I almost broke my neck.
28591,Raj,I think it’s an old storage room.
28592,Sheldon,Hah-hah!
28593,Sheldon,I’m fine with it.
28594,Penny,My friend Justin.
28595,Leonard,What?
28596,Leonard,Sex doesn’t count.
28597,Howard,Did you go to your prom?
28598,Sheldon,Arthur. What are you doing here? I I don’t think I need any more advice.
28599,Sheldon,Oh. Oh I’m sorry. Correction that woman not only had vigorous coitus with Bert she also tipped him a dollar for a job well done. – That better?
28601,Leonard,Oh I would but we need to make a push on the air force project.
28602,Sheldon,Like what?
28603,Leonard,A Slim Jim?
28604,Leonard,We just spent two hours in traffic. Did you think to mention to me that you liked our paper?
28605,Sheldon,But I’m hanging out with my friend and we’re having fun. Look how happy he is.
28606,Penny,Well they’re pretty tasty.
28607,Raj,Yeah.
28608,Sheldon,What happened to you?
28609,Leonard,Are you sure this is right?
28610,Howard,So you’re wandering all around by yourself? That’s not the kind of hero’s welcome an astronaut should come home to.
28611,Leonard,Not the roommate agreement.
28612,Leonard,I’m not seeing anyone using liquid helium vortices like this.
28614,Sheldon,This is nothing but a blatant abuse of power by a petty functionary. Explain to me why Wil Wheaton and his lackeys get in and we don’t.
28615,Penny,So um Amy what about you? Do you date much?
28616,Leonard,I didn’t tell Sheldon so we could have a few days alone.
28617,Penny,Guys.
28618,Sheldon,But that’s my room.
28620,Sheldon,I have no idea what she’s talking about but we’re ganging up on you so I agree.
28621,Raj,Happy and well-fed. You see that’s what I’m taking from that story.
28622,Leonard,I know this isn’t my area and I could never do the math like you can but could this be something?
28623,Leonard,Doing it right now. Oh they can’t. There’s an important Little League game tomorrow.
28624,Leonard,Well now they’re yours.
28626,Sheldon,All right my friend. Would you like some cholermus?
28628,Leonard,Okay now what you want to do first is turn on the ignition and shift into drive.
28629,Howard,We believe cows are gods.
28630,Penny,I don’t want you to make a big deal out of it.
28631,Sheldon,Okay step four. Do you see that small plastic case on my dresser?
28632,Sheldon,Oh well apparently Leonard thinks he’s better than everyone in the whole world including those fighting for our freedom. Yeah well I don’t know about you but I support our boys overseas.
28633,Howard,I’d like you to call me sexy.
28634,Sheldon,I expect you to wipe the pudding off your chin. Gentlemen.
28635,Leonard,Never leave a belt on the floor. At night they look like snakes.
28636,Leonard,In sunglasses and a hat after I parked two blocks away.
28637,Sheldon,It’s by way of an apology for my recent behaviour. I’ve had some time to reflect and I’ve come to realize that friendship is not an aggregation of written agreements. It’s a result of two people respecting and caring for each other. Butterscotch scone?
28638,Penny,What 21 seconds? That’ll be like seeing a whole new movie!
28639,Penny,Oh my God. What personal habits?
28640,Leonard,Never noticed that about you.
28641,Penny,Hey.
28642,Sheldon,I have spent years turning this lump of clay into an acceptable conduit for my will and then you came along and reshaped him with your newfangled ideas and your fancy genitals.
28643,Penny,Yeah uh I got a job as a pharmaceutical sales rep.
28644,Penny,The reason that date is like so totally fixed in my memory is that I had the privilege to be witness to one of the most heroic acts I’ve ever seen in like ever.
28646,Sheldon,Oh oh on the contrary. Couples costumes are one of the few benefits of being in a relationship. Now imagine this you and I entering Stuart’s party and all eyes turn to see America’s most beloved and glamorous couple.
28647,Penny,Ah I feel just like Mother Teresa. Except for the virgin part. That ship sailed a long time ago.
28648,Leonard,Sheldon.
28649,Sheldon,Sonny and Cher made it work. Their variety show kept going long after the divorce and here we are still talking about them.
28650,Leonard,Funny how things work out isn’t it?
28651,Sheldon,No. No no no no.
28652,Sheldon,Wait hang on. You’ve spent time with Amy. Can you think of anything she’s fond of that has a bunch of flaws she hasn’t noticed?
28653,Howard,So did I.
28654,Sheldon,Fine. Give me a second.
28655,Sheldon,Yes. Must be killing you wondering who. Fine I’ll tell you. Stuart from the comic bookstore Barry Kripke from the university Penny’s ex-boyfriend Zack and TV’s LeVar Burton.
28656,Howard,Wait a second the good wife is crying. Something’s very wrong.
28657,Leonard,We could tell him they wanted the couch to stay away from their boyfriend.
28658,Sheldon,When I’m lying comatose in a hospital relying on inferior minds to cure me these jello cultures and my accompanying notes will give them a fighting chance.
28659,Leonard,Come on Sheldon. You know all the Christmas stories and the carols you’ve got an eggnog moustache going on there. Just admit it. You’re getting a little Yuletide spirit.
28660,Penny,What’s he talking about?
28661,Penny,Cover this suckers. Ha-ha-ha!
28662,Sheldon,I went to the market with Penny.
28663,Penny,Wait I thought we were reading.
28664,Leonard,Do you really think there’s gonna be a breakthrough without you there to do it?
28665,Penny,Yes. Oh bet your girlfriend is super bummed you had to work tonight. Anyway look we have been waiting a while and I just…
28666,Raj,Hey. Emily right?
28667,Raj,Yeah you’re missing the point Sheldon.
28668,Sheldon,Are you sure? It just doesn’t feel as innocent as it used to.
28669,Penny,So tell me about your day how’s it going with the particle detector?
28670,Leonard,I’m sorry I didn’t hear anything after lick.
28671,Penny,Shake it baby shake it!
28672,Raj,What are you drawing over there?
28673,Penny,Oh you’ve been falling all night. You’re used to it.
28674,Sheldon,Yes for the first five or six years but I’ve gotten used to it. It helps me sleep. He’s like my mucus-powered white noise machine.
28676,Sheldon,Not at all. Amy?
28677,Penny,Okay. I’m just gonna tie my shoe while you think about that.
28679,Sheldon,For shame Leonard. For shame. And to think I was ready to waste the last of my good haemorrhoid cream on you.
28680,Leonard,Where are you going?
28681,Penny,I do. You know Leonard’s right. Talking to you is really helping.
28682,Penny,I smell Chinese food.
28683,Sheldon,That would be my understanding. On a less painful subject what size T-shirt do you take?
28684,Leonard,Look if you weren’t happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me.
28685,Leonard,I can’t believe the Air Force would treat us like that.
28686,Leonard,Hi. So nice to finally meet you. Let me take this for you Meemaw.
28687,Howard,Hey when you got home today complaining that you felt sick from eating too many jelly beans did I tell you how to fix it? No. I said aw that must hurt and I rubbed your belly.
28688,Leonard,Listen to me. You are over-tired. You’re not thinking right. Put the movie back before we get into trouble.
28689,Sheldon,Lucky.
28690,Sheldon,I see. I own nine pairs of underpants.
28691,Sheldon,You sure it’s not too much Bible juice?
28692,Howard,I’m on a cloud. Swing me. 
28693,Leonard,Yeah.
28694,Howard,It’s like we both had these holes in our lives but now we fill each other’s holes.
28695,Leonard,So we made you an appointment and we want you to keep it.
28696,Sheldon,Oh I’d be incensed.
28697,Howard,Hey since Sheldon’s not going to Comic-Con maybe we could find a cool trio to dress up as.
28698,Sheldon,Oh. Well so the emotional turmoil that’s been keeping me from achieving REM sleep was entirely unjustified?
28699,Raj,Well I’m going back to India. What’s your plan?
28700,Penny,Seriously do I not get credit for knowing beta test?
28701,Leonard,Short Round?
28702,Penny,No I don’t want to break his heart. I love him. This is just happening too fast.
28703,Sheldon,Waltz. It’s a social dance from Austria choreographed to a three-four time signature. 
28704,Howard,In the last two hours 162 women have read our profiles. How many of them have sent us messages?
28706,Sheldon,Well anyway um you may find this hard to believe but I didn’t have any friends growing up.
28707,Sheldon,And to clarify?
28708,Leonard,It’s fine. And also not true.
28709,Sheldon,Mother if you’re going to conduct your life in this fashion then I should let you know that the world has changed since you were a young woman. You know it’s not all sock hops soda jerks and segregation anymore.
28710,Howard,Junior Mints are pretty apologetic.
28711,Penny,I just told her you’re an aerospace engineer you speak five languages…
28712,Sheldon,I knew it. Just keep going I guess I’m good at this.
28713,Howard,Yes I’m very hopeful. Hello Missy.  They mentioned there may be side effects.
28715,Leonard,Come on.
28716,Sheldon,Because we don’t throw parties.
28717,Howard,I appreciate the apology but it’s really not necessary. I overstepped my bounds.
28718,Penny,I’m regretting this already.
28719,Penny,Oh I don’t want credit for that.
28720,Sheldon,Well come now Leonard this may be your only chance to make a real contribution to science!
28721,Penny,No.
28722,Penny,Sheldon I’m gonna make some cocoa. Do you want some?
28723,Penny,Uh he… .
28724,Penny,Sheldon what did we say about being a nicer friend?
28725,Penny,Hello Sheldon.
28726,Penny,It’s really good. We’ve been talking about the origins of slavery. Turn in my first paper tomorrow.
28727,Raj,You know in India when my baby brother cried like that the servants would just take him far away so we couldn’t hear it. Not always sometimes we’d leave.
28728,Sheldon,You laugh now you just wait until you need tech support.
28729,Sheldon,What if that burning food attracts animals?
28730,Sheldon,Will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce?
28731,Sheldon,That’s happy right?
28732,Sheldon,Nobody calls me Moon Pie but Meemaw!
28733,Penny,Not only did they eat together Leonard said he made her laugh.
28734,Leonard,Oh hi. Hey. Hi Leslie.
28735,Penny,Mmm.
28736,Raj,So your theme is I saw a rerun of Mad Men and bought some crab puffs from Trader Joe’s? Hate to miss that.
28737,Howard,Maybe he didn’t know what to pair champagne with. Strawberries caviar oysters. All good choices. Yeah that look right there is why people eat before they come to your parties.
28738,Howard,Oh Sheldon you remind me of a young Lex Luthor.
28739,Sheldon,Bakersfield. I see. Where has this list been all my life?
28740,Sheldon,Euclid Avenue is shorter as the crow flies but it has speed bumps which appreciably increase point-to-point drive time making it the less efficient choice. But you have the conn. Of course if you’re not going to slow down for the speed bumps I withdraw my previous objection. Here’s a fun question. Do you know what the most common street name is?
28741,Penny,Sheldon hold on. Could you maybe show me how to make more money with this?
28742,Penny,Love you too.
28743,Sheldon,It’s fun for ages eight to eighty. Join us.
28744,Raj,Hallway. 
28745,Penny,I’m listening.
28746,Leonard,No. She cannot kiss. What is wrong with you people?
28747,Howard,I know. Being an astrophysicist right now is like being a rock star.
28748,Leonard,What’s your point?
28749,Howard,Penis first?
28750,Sheldon,Thank you. Aren’t you sweet.
28751,Leonard,Guys there are four of us and one of him.
28752,Sheldon,Curse you.
28753,Sheldon,Of course I do. My watch is linked to the atomic clock in Boulder Colorado. It’s accurate to one tenth of a second. But as I’m saying this it occurs to me that once again your question may have been rhetorical.
28754,Leonard,Fine.
28755,Leonard,What?
28756,Leonard,Yeah well I’ve been dreaming about spending Valentine’s Day with a girl since I was six.
28757,Leonard,Alright. Here we go. My first birthday party.
28758,Penny,Shhh! Sheldon what do you want.
28759,Sheldon,Did you know that when Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone he proposed answering it with ahoy? Ahoy. I like it. Amy? Is that you? Have you been drinking? I’m sorry I bet my sweet what? Well all right. We’re on our way.
28760,Leonard,Great. Well bye.
28762,Penny,It does?
28763,Sheldon,I know. Although I’ve always hated how my right frontal lobe looks in pictures.
28764,Sheldon,I never got to ask my question about Batman.
28765,Sheldon,Oh me too.
28766,Howard,Thank you.
28767,Howard,Okay I’ll tell you but please don’t judge me. He pays for my car my rent and my credit cards.
28768,Sheldon,The frequency with which your parents had intercourse.
28769,Raj,Where did my life go Penny? One day I’m a carefree batchelor and the next I’m married and driving a minivan to peewee cricket matches in suburban New Delhi.
28770,Leonard,Seriously? You’re not coming?
28772,Penny,Sorry. I’ll get better.
28773,Penny,Yeah I don’t think the water was really boiling.
28774,Sheldon,Oh hi mom. No I told you I’d call you when I got home I’m not home yet.  Alright I’m home. The Arctic expedition was a remarkable success I’m all but certain there’s a Nobel Prize in my future. Actually I shouldn’t say that. I’m entirely certain. No mother I could not feel your church group praying for my safety. The fact that I’m home safe is not proof that it worked that logic is Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc. No I’m not sassing you in Eskimo talk.
28775,Penny,Okay. Nope. That’s it. We are gonna go over there right now and you are going to let them out.
28776,Raj,I’m telling you dude the song has no groove you can’t dance to it.
28777,Sheldon,The philosopher Henri Bergson says it’s funny when a human being behaves like an object.
28778,Sheldon,Yes. You’re either with me or against me.
28779,Howard,What right do you have to pick who I can have children with?
28780,Sheldon, Penny. Oh yeah much better.
28781,Sheldon,I was too busy squishing all the desirable parts of her body.
28782,Penny,I don’t care. We’ll make our own music.
28783,Howard,Yeah literally none of it.
28784,Penny,Hey Sheldon.
28785,Sheldon,Well then buckle up in the next four to eight days she’s going to get very crabby.
28786,Sheldon,What are you sure? It’s my first prom I want to do it correctly.
28787,Leonard,Close enough come on.  Hi Raj.
28788,Penny,Doing laundry?
28789,Howard,That’s a penguin I sponsor. They’re losing their homes to global warming and my car gets like seven miles a gallon so I felt bad.
28790,Sheldon,I was afraid you might bring this up so I have a work-around. There you go. As far as you’re concerned I’m smiling. Although I must admit I’m smiling a little bit at the moment because this loophole is so brilliant.
28792,Penny,Come here. 
28793,Leonard,I’ll try but I might be sad again tonight.
28794,Howard,Yeah Meemaw did the nasty.
28795,Sheldon,East Texas. A warm summer night. A woman Mary stands on a porch. In the distance we hear a lonesome train whistle. Woo-woo. The droning buzz of cicadas. Zzzzzzzzz. A coyote howls at the moon frightening sensitive young boys everywhere. Aw-aw-aw! Out in the woods an owl screeches.
28796,Penny,Well if it makes you feel any better Bernadette’s mad at me too.
28797,Sheldon,Oh I would but I’m on my way out.
28798,Penny,What?
28799,Penny,Because she is pretty and smart and when you talk about work she doesn’t have to go home and look up words in the dictionary to understand what you said.
28800,Howard,Good night.
28801,Sheldon,Thank you. I wouldn’t even know how to begin.
28802,Sheldon,No. Origami napkin swans that’s the headline.
28803,Sheldon,Really? I would point out that I am at the top of my profession while you preside over the kiddy table of yours.
28804,Penny,Oh you sexy wheezy little man.
28805,Sheldon,So it would be today? Huh. Well I suppose there’s something satisfying about dying on my birthday.
28806,Howard,If you need a green hand why not just use the Hulk?
28807,Howard,Address?
28808,Raj,I’ve been babysitting him way longer than you have.
28809,Sheldon,No I’d look silly in that helmet.
28810,Raj,Go away. She wants New Delhi not Kosher deli. Besides you have a girlfriend.
28811,Leonard,Yes.
28812,Sheldon,Well whatever it is it looks heavy. I’m gonna need you two to get it downstairs before Amy comes home.
28813,Penny,Oh come on Leonard I know the car was a thoughtful gesture and I really appreciate it but it doesn’t make sense to have both.
28814,Sheldon,One minute is a long time.
28815,Leonard,No because I liked it.
28816,Sheldon,Have a chocolate.
28817,Howard,I hate trains.
28818,Sheldon,Yes you were very clear as was everyone else at the table. Tom however has been chosen by science as a suitable mate for Penny.
28819,Sheldon,All right! Fence mended problem swept under the rug. Time to bowl! Yes I was eavesdropping there’s a lot at stake here.
28820,Penny,Of course.
28821,Leonard,I’m sure that would pair nicely with your fried nuggets of chicken.
28822,Leonard,Yes.
28823,Penny,So when do you guys think you’re gonna move in?
28824,Penny,That’s a dollar.
28825,Sheldon,I came to tell you I’ve got the answer.
28826,Penny,Ooh am I about to get a rare Sheldon Cooper hug?
28827,Penny,Can I ask you a question?
28828,Raj,I think we were misled about the cute girls.
28829,Leonard,What?
28831,Sheldon,One time they tried to make Richard Feynman take a vacation but he chose instead to expand his mind and learn something new. He went to work in his friend’s biology lab. Richard Feynman was a famous American physicist part of the Manhattan Project.
28832,Sheldon,My God! Why don’t you just tell them I’m a toll taker at the Golden Gate Bridge? Rocket scientist how humiliating.
28833,Sheldon,The audible sigh is a show of exasperation right?
28834,Penny,A little something? Oh it… what this is huge.
28835,Penny,Okay Leonard honey you know if you’re uncomfortable with the way things are going you’re allowed to say something.
28836,Leonard,So come on how was the first day with Hawking?
28837,Howard,Aah! It’s eating his face!
28839,Sheldon,Oh. Well now I’m sorry I asked.
28840,Howard,Okay then you go there.
28841,Leonard,Well that’s it. That’s the end of Roger Abbott.
28842,Raj,I don’t know guys. Maybe this relationship isn’t for me. Maybe I should break up with her.
28843,Sheldon,Well now but do you think that’s a good idea? Uh you know Star Trek. Should a guy with no name and a red shirt really go on an expedition?
28844,Leonard,Penny you don’t have to do that.
28845,Penny,Turn it over.
28846,Sheldon,Yeah.
28847,Leonard,Hmmm.
28848,Sheldon,Tonight I’ll be watching a show rated M.A. and that stands for mature audiences buster.
28849,Sheldon,No I suppose not.
28850,Leonard,Come on I’ll show you the trick with the shower.
28851,Leonard,Okay-dokay.
28852,Sheldon,For future reference if I want to watch Mean Girls I’ll stream it on Netflix.
28853,Penny,Oh which one? Maybe we can get Amy to try it.
28854,Howard,Oh did some bad man put us in a drawer?
28855,Howard,I will.
28856,Sheldon,I never admit defeat.
28857,Howard,You did what you had to do. 
28858,Leonard,No no Stan Lee.
28859,Raj,Your words fall like acid rain on the wounded petals of my heart.
28860,Leonard,No.
28861,Sheldon,Examining perturbative amplitudes in n=4 supersymmetric theories leading to a re-examination of the ultraviolet properties of multi-loop n=8 supergravity using modern twistor theory.
28862,Leonard,Morning Sheldon.
28863,Howard,Dude I’m glad you finally got a girlfriend but do you have to do all that lovey-dovey stuff in front of those of us who don’t?
28864,Raj,Amy.
28865,Raj,You know he might not reopen. He didn’t get a lot of money from the insurance company.
28866,Leonard,Okay.
28868,Sheldon,Oh Penny this is a natural human process and we’re talking about statistically significant savings. Now if you assume 15 tampons per cycle and a 28 day cycle are you fairly regular?  Okay no warehouse store but we’re still on for put-put golf right?
28869,Leonard,Trust me call her.
28870,Leonard,Fine whatever. Priya will be having breakfast.
28871,Penny,Fine.  Happy?
28872,Raj,Well it’s getting late. Maybe we should head home.
28873,Howard,Uh so you’ll watch it?
28874,Leonard,Don’t you dare missy.
28875,Leonard,I think we’re all talking to Penny here.
28877,Sheldon,No.
28878,Sheldon,We we really appreciate it.
28879,Sheldon,Give it a second to load. Whenever you’re ready AT&T! Okay here we go. This is us here. To the south is Professor Loomis and the Geology Department. According to their Twitter feed they’re out of sunblock which means they’ll have to hug the tree line or risk melanoma. That’s our edge. All we have to do is move quickly over this ridge the rock-worshipping pasty-faced bastards won’t know what hit them. All right let’s move out.
28880,Raj,Oh we could set it up like a scavenger hunt where the last puzzle gives the winner Sheldon’s contact information.
28881,Sheldon,Would you look at that? The image we gave it was 45% white noise and it still managed to reconstruct it.
28883,Leonard,Yeah fine.
28884,Leonard,Don’t speak.
28885,Penny,Nope never.
28886,Penny,Why not?
28887,Sheldon,People usually start a meeting with a joke but you go ahead end with one.
28888,Raj,Mmm. Oh cheesecake you’re just as good as a woman even though I can’t have sex with you.
28889,Raj,What else?
28890,Penny,I’m sorry?
28891,Raj,Why can’t I find someone? I’m smart I’ve got a cool job and my naturally bronzed complexion means I can pull off mustard yellow in a way most guys can’t.
28892,Sheldon,This is a Jewish house. I don’t think they have pigskin.
28893,Sheldon,You Indian.
28894,Penny,No. Yeah.
28895,Howard,I’m sorry are you under the impression that we’re still friends?
28896,Penny,Oh!
28897,Howard,Nothing to worry about. She’s just been crying for a little while and I was wondering if you had any tricks to get her to sleep.
28898,Howard,There are six seasons dude.
28899,Leonard,Before an application is released they give it a trial run. W-We could do that. And if we hit a rough spot instead of getting mad just say hey we found a bug and we report it so it can be fixed.
28900,Sheldon,I’m not going to work today. And would you like to know why?
28901,Raj,I’ll match it plus a thousand rupees.
28903,Sheldon,I do. And yet I’m doomed while you live on.
28904,Leonard,Oh no I I’ve worked through a lot of that stuff I’m better now.
28905,Leonard,Didn’t I tell you I’d be working nights and that you’d have to make other arrangements.
28906,Leonard,Sheldon can I talk to you in private?
28907,Leonard,Great be right back.
28909,Raj,Well I didn’t get to see you last night. It was the least I could do.
28910,Penny,Because the last me I didn’t go I ended up playing Mystic Warlords of Ka.
28911,Raj,What else? Sell it on ebay as slightly used.
28912,Sheldon,…tion. Okay. For the sake of argument let’s say I have a problem. What would be your plan for addressing it?
28913,Raj,A little baby.
28914,Raj,Uh I gave her an Imodium. That’s tomorrow’s problem.
28915,Leonard,Well for starters you’ve broken up with me so many times which first date are we talking about?
28916,Penny,You don’t even like people touching you. How are you going to have sex?
28917,Penny,Well the doctor’s a woman but yes because you never know.
28918,Raj,Indy’s young sidekick from Temple of Doom.
28919,Sheldon,Wasn’t Mary Magdalene a woman of ill repute?
28920,Leonard,What with my tongue in your tail?
28921,Sheldon,So that’s all you’ve got? Apocalyptic genocide and go easy on the cologne?
28922,Sheldon,You thought the opposite of stupid loser was community college graduate?
28923,Penny,A… S… Take me home.
28924,Leonard,Fine don’t tell me.
28925,Penny,So how do I undo this?
28926,Sheldon,Well I’m not sure I have a dominant leg. They’re both pretty submissive.
28927,Leonard,Your hypothesis is completely disconfirmed by all the data. You’re just clinging to it out of intellectual stubbornness.
28928,Sheldon,Sure you can you’re doing fine it’s very believable.
28929,Leonard,No it’s no big deal it’s just the way I was raised. My parents focussed on celebrating achievements and being expelled from a birth canal was not considered one of them.
28930,Howard,Fifteen seconds.
28931,Penny,Hi. All right sweetie. You hang in there today.
28932,Howard,Hey. Thanks for coming by.
28933,Raj,No seriously. It’s about being present in the moment focusing on the feeling of the warm water the smell of the detergent the sound of the dishes squeaking and following your own breath. It’s about it’s about simply being.
28934,Leonard,You do have a problem with her hanging out with me.
28935,Leonard,Smother Sheldon in his sleep? Wouldn’t that be wrong?
28936,Penny,Well you know what? Maybe I need a break from all of you. Come on Sheldon.
28937,Sheldon,Well I believe we were kissing like randy teenagers and your nose was whistling ever so slightly.
28938,Sheldon,So what time does the costume parade start?
28939,Leonard,You think?
28941,Sheldon,Hello. This is Sheldon.
28942,Leonard,Listen I should warn you that maybe asking Amy out isn’t a good idea.
28943,Sheldon,You brought up the subject. I contributed an interesting fact on that subject. It’s called the art of conversation. Okay your turn.
28944,Leonard,Yeah well don’t be a stranger.
28945,Leonard,Do you mean that?
28946,Raj,Why don’t you just do the test?
28947,Leonard,Oh-oh.
28948,Sheldon,The mean Indian lady tried to make me eat lamb. Congratulations. Pizza night will now be at your apartment. Order one.
28949,Leonard,Sounds like you’re gonna need a cheaper place to live.
28950,Sheldon,I apologize for exceeding my allotted bathroom time.
28951,Sheldon,Good King Wenceslas looked out on the feast of Stephen. When the snow lay ’round about deep and crisp and even
28952,Sheldon,Really? Leonard there are no heroes when it comes to dermatitis.
28953,Sheldon,Have I crossed some sort of line again?
28954,Sheldon,Well I suppose I could poison Kripke.
28955,Leonard,Leslie I have a question for you and it might be a little awkward you know given that I…
28956,Penny,Uh-huh.
28957,Leonard,We’re socialising. Meeting new people.
28958,Leonard,No no. People don’t talk about surface tension. If you imagine our three-space as the surface of an N-dimensional superfluid bubble… This is exciting. This is really exciting. I have to go find Sheldon.
28959,Penny,Sorry. Hey who’s not the murderer?
28960,Sheldon,Do you make it with milk or water?
28961,Howard,Okay how about you just dip your toe in and meet one of them?
28962,Penny,Alright now Sheldon you and I are about to have a problem.
28963,Leonard,It still feels weird just throwing away his work like this.
28964,Raj,You know it it’s bad enough that I have to deal with this…
28965,Howard,That’s good quality video.
28966,Leonard,Speech! Speech!
28967,Sheldon,Oh hello everyone. I am happy to report I’m feeling much better.
28968,Howard,Yes. Also don’t forget to close the toilet or she’ll drink out of it.
28969,Leonard,When was the last time you were at Best Buy and you heard someone say ooh check out this Blu-ray player it must be good it was built in Russia”?
28970,Raj,Eleven. Wait. Do I count the 200-pound Sailor Moon girl that Howard and I had a threesome with at Comic Con?
28971,Sheldon,Excuse me that is my research and it is by no means a dead end.
28972,Leonard,Got it. .
28973,Sheldon,It was a compromise. I lost.
28974,Sheldon,Oh the project is classified. I can’t tell you. Oh I suppose I could redact the classified parts. All right um I came up with an elegant solution to the  Wow I wonder what they’re redacting.
28975,Sheldon,Thank you.
28976,Leonard,Uh Sheldon?
28977,Sheldon,Oh. Remember when we got this at Comic-Con?
28978,Howard,Yeah so what?
28979,Raj,Well don’t be too mean.
28980,Penny,What?
28981,Leonard,Oh I don’t mind. If you pull a butterscotch out of your pocket it would be like I’m walking with my grandma.
28982,Leonard,Okay. Bye-bye! What are you looking at?You’ve never seen a hypocrite before?
28983,Leonard,All I know is it wasn’t the way I dreamed it would be.
28984,Penny,Thanks for cooking.
28985,Howard,Really because I saw Peter Pan and you’re dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby. She was a little bigger than you but it’s basically the same look man.
28986,Penny,Sheldon being physical with Amy is a huge step for you.
28987,Leonard,You’re not changing how Penny laughs.
28988,Raj,And I have to be honest I thought it was disturbing and weird and it made me wonder what it says about someone who enjoys it.
28989,Sheldon,Fine. I’m sorry. Thank you for the thoughtful gift. I really do appreciate it. As you know I had become attached to my old laptop. But I’m sure in time that this one will… Jeepers creepers that started up fast.
28990,Sheldon,Bippity-boppity-boo.
28991,Leonard,He’s drowning us out. He doesn’t like fighting.
28992,Leonard,Nothing.
28993,Leonard,So cocoa?
28994,Sheldon,Does that mean the relationship is over?
28995,Leonard,Aren’t you gonna look at the board to see how right we are?
28996,Penny,Okay. Fine. Would you feel better if I propose so you could turn me down again?
28997,Penny,Hey how was dinner?
28998,Leonard,Hi.
28999,Howard,Ooh somebody’s been taking bitchy pills.
29000,Raj,I wouldn’t mind a glass.
29001,Leonard,All right then go.
29003,Sheldon,Fine. Then Grumpy what’s he so grumpy about? Maybe his girlfriend won’t take his side.
29004,Leonard,So? Even if it is you have a huge advantage because you’re an actual actress. Most of the people doing this are just weirdoes and nerds. Wolowitz sent his in two days ago.
29005,Penny,Why would you bring that up right now?
29006,Howard,She says it the same way I do. I’d love that. Everybody in India says it that way. It’s not a big deal.
29007,Sheldon,Don’t blame me. Blame your pal biology. He’s the pervert pulling the strings here.
29008,Leonard,Sunday’s gone.
29009,Penny,That’s just the booze talking.
29010,Howard,You’re wrong.
29011,Penny,Right okay look this is between you and me you cannot tell Leonard any of this.
29012,Penny,It’s just when we were kissing I couldn’t help but picture you with that other girl.
29013,Leonard,No you don’t. But let’s say you do. And don’t say you do because you don’t. Now wouldn’t you think that throwing yourself into your work would be the best way to deal with it?
29014,Raj,So anyway after a fantastic lunch I was whisked off to the People magazine photo shoot… have any of you boys ever been to a photo shoot?
29015,Leonard,Yeah he’s on his way. Time for bladder check.
29016,Leonard,What are you doing here?
29017,Leonard,Kill me.
29018,Leonard,Same here.
29019,Sheldon,Brobdingnagian.
29020,Penny,Well dead whore on TV live one in real life.
29021,Howard,How are your crab cakes?
29022,Howard,I lied. I love them. I only said that so you’d go out with me.
29023,Leonard,How so?
29024,Penny,Oh my gosh why are we whispering?
29025,Sheldon,Very well I’m sure I can find something that will help you ditch that itch.
29026,Sheldon,Interesting. Do you recall this conversation? Leonard want to go halfsies on a steamer? No Sheldon we don’t need a steamer. Looks like that rumpled chicken’s come home to roost.
29027,Leonard,Can you finish it later?
29028,Sheldon,Way to go on the details.
29029,Sheldon,Wonderful. Dinner some assembly required.
29030,Leonard,I’m… uh… at work.
29031,Howard,Well they already had a village.
29032,Penny,Vegas isn’t that far away.
29033,Leonard,Um…
29034,Penny,So how did the beautiful mind of Sheldon Cooper forget his key in the first place.
29035,Penny,Because you e-mail me your bathroom schedule once a week even though I’ve clicked unsubscribe like a thousand times. So what’s going on?
29036,Leonard,You know what I’m happy that Penny’s moving on. It gives me the freedom to move on myself.
29037,Sheldon,From that key maker I highly doubt it.
29038,Howard,It was until I realized the screen had frozen. Still one of my top three dates of all time.
29039,Raj,What is it about this holiday that makes people so unhappy?
29040,Penny,Are you a hundred percent positive you love and want to marry Howard Wolowitz?
29041,Leonard,Sorry.
29042,Sheldon,Don’t be silly I borrowed one of your pillow cases.
29043,Howard,Why do you need Kripke? Can’t you just go to Party City for helium?
29044,Sheldon,It was obviously effective Leonard grew up to be an experimental physicist. Perhaps if she’d also denied him Christmas he’d be a little better at it.
29045,Sheldon,It’s like it was yesterday.
29047,Raj,It’s the atomic number for technetium.
29048,Sheldon,Oh. As they were incorrectly sliced you can see how I could mistake them for my sashimi.
29049,Penny,Hi. We’re just heading out for a drink.
29050,Raj,I’m very happy you were able to hang out tonight.
29052,Penny,But you commissioned it.
29053,Raj,Dude you made the right choice coming to me for help with this party.
29054,Sheldon,Could you? That would solve everything. You are the best. I’ll see you at dinner tonight?
29055,Penny,My point is there was a time I never would’ve been friends with someone like you and now you are one of my favourite people. So if what you need is to spend your birthday in a bathroom I’m happy to do it with you.
29056,Leonard,Well you know I gave you the snowflake and we were kissing and… Oh come on I don’t want to go to Texas!
29058,Penny,I had to; we’re married now.
29059,Sheldon,Oh Mario. If only I could control everyone the way I control you. Hop you little plumber hop hop hop.
29060,Penny,Okay indoor it is. Big or small?
29061,Raj,Ah the premature I love you.
29062,Howard,Hey. What brings you by?
29063,Howard,Great. Then she won’t know I’m lying.
29064,Leonard,Oh I’m so sure I’m going to regret this but who was I with?
29065,Raj,I I nibbled. I was being playful.
29066,Sheldon,Says the former member of the Corn Queen’s Court.
29067,Sheldon,They’re perfect. It tastes like her hugs.
29068,Leonard,To my bedroom so I can take everything off but those glasses. And maybe the boots.
29069,Leonard,Oh yeah? What about it?
29070,Penny,Yeah and the hors d’oeuvres are delightful.
29071,Penny,What about me what?
29072,Sheldon,Can we just focus on the decision I’m facing?
29073,Raj,Open wide here comes the happy train.
29074,Penny,Yeah no no I-I-I got that.
29075,Penny,Um…
29076,Leonard,I assumed he was joking. You’d be surprised how many particle physicists have a whimsical side.
29077,Leonard,What?
29078,Penny,Ah. Well I’m sure things will pick up.
29079,Leonard,I found another tweet from a student at Sheldon’s lecture. Dr. Cooper has taken a relatively boring subject and managed to make it completely insufferable. Plus he looks like a giant insect.
29080,Howard,But this is other money.
29081,Sheldon,Oh don’t be. You get your hopes up I knock them down. That’s called teamwork.
29082,Raj,I wonder how they smell.
29083,Howard,My name is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali and this is my friend Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
29084,Sheldon,You’re making it difficult to love you right now.
29085,Sheldon,I’m sorry Penny I don’t think so.
29086,Raj,What is everyone booing at?
29087,Raj,Why?
29088,Penny,This looks like some serious stuff Leonard did you do this?
29089,Sheldon,You’re kidding right?
29090,Raj,Hey congratulations Bert.
29091,Howard,Go ahead make jokes. I don’t know why you think you’re going to Comic-Con you just had a baby.
29092,Leonard,Yeah sure.
29093,Howard,I wouldn’t mind a glass.
29094,Leonard,Mmm when really we’re just exiting an uncomfortable situation.
29095,Penny,Uh well you know your private bathroom?
29096,Leonard,Hey what’s up?
29097,Sheldon,I have no idea. Because the story of me sewing the first American flag is unsupported poppycock.
29098,Sheldon,I do. For thousands of years the lowest classes of the human race have spent their lives labouring to erect monuments under the lash of their betters until finally they dropped down and became one with the dust through which they trudged. Do you have anything like that?
29099,Raj,You know what? At least you guys did something. You know you you had a theory you wrote a paper you made an actual contribution. All guys like this do is just stand on other people’s work.
29100,Raj,Who died and made you king of moments?
29101,Sheldon,Alright that’s enough juvenile squabbling stop it stop it I say. I’m going to settle this right now. Neither of you are good enough for my sister.
29102,Leonard,Yeah.
29103,Raj,Forty-five.
29104,Raj,Oh yes Leonard. Yes it was.
29105,Raj,Okay. Ooh perhaps today is the day we finally find out what’s inside the Magic Eight Ball.
29106,Leonard,Can you define the parameters of the kiss?
29107,Leonard,Oh.
29108,Penny,Yeah. It’s on the recommended reading list for my psychology class.
29109,Penny,But what about your time machine.
29110,Leonard,Yes.
29111,Sheldon,And to answer it we first must ask ourselves what is physics?
29113,Sheldon,I never want this day to end.
29114,Sheldon,What you’re not my mother.
29115,Raj,intoxicating isn’t it?
29116,Sheldon,That’s actually not bad advice. You know I didn’t seek out string theory. It just hit me over the head one day.
29117,Leonard,What’s going on?
29118,Sheldon,All your ideas address the issue at a university level. By then it’s too late. You need to design an outreach program that targets girls at the middle school level and sets them on an academic track towards the hard sciences.
29119,Leonard,You know what? Screw you Sheldon. You are the most annoying person I have ever met.
29120,Howard,I’m sorry this does not look like Texas. Where’s the tumbleweeds? Where’s the saloons?
29121,Howard,It’s just a phone.
29122,Penny,Sorry guys. This club was so great how could they turn it into a bookstore? I thought we got rid of all those.
29123,Sheldon,Straightening up.
29124,Sheldon,Oh no pressure. Just get him a crummy card you’re good.
29125,Penny,Oh yeah I’m wondering about that. You said it was working when you moved in.
29126,Sheldon,And now for dessert come on hot fudge sundae come on hot fudge sundae. Bam! That’s what I’m talking about!
29127,Leonard,If that’s so what if I start talking to a girl?
29128,Penny,Yes. Pi.
29129,Raj,What would a toilet look like in Atlantis? How would you flush it? And when you did flush it where would the poop go?
29130,Penny,Oh boy a whole dollar. Now I can quit my paper route. So what’s in it?
29131,Sheldon,It’s still my turn.
29132,Penny,Phone now.
29133,Sheldon,Yes and do you know what the odds are I’d pick your name?
29134,Sheldon,Why would that make me feel better?
29135,Penny,Okay yeah I kind of crossed a line. Put him back on.
29136,Sheldon,No no that’s not mine. It has a big spot on it.
29137,Sheldon,Yes. Why do you ask?
29138,Penny,I didn’t know what else to do. He had those big sad eyes.
29140,Sheldon,Yes. I think you’d like her. She’s extremely intelligent just like you. Unlike you she’s tall blonde and used to be an Olympic swimmer.
29141,Sheldon,Well you didn’t specify.
29142,Howard,It’s true. I’ve seen him at the beach he’s like a human chicken wing.
29143,Sheldon,Wait! You bought me a present?
29144,Penny,Hey. Oh I put your clothes in the dryer.
29145,Sheldon,Thank you.
29147,Howard,You’re kidding.
29148,Howard,Oh uh come in come in. Oh I uh I didn’t think I was going to get to see you until tomorrow.
29149,Leonard,Just eat your tangerine chicken.
29150,Howard,She’s gonna be okay; they’re gonna let me take her home.
29151,Sheldon,I’ve always found that an inappropriate slur. Chickens are not by nature at all timid. In fact when I was young my neighbour’s chicken got loose and chased me up the big elm tree in front of our house.
29152,Sheldon,Oh I’ve seen that look before. This is just going to be two weeks of moping and tedious emo songs and calling me to come down to pet stores to look at cats. I don’t know if I can take it.
29153,Sheldon,Well unless of course he’s a skilled hypnotist.
29154,Penny,Bark once if you need me to call PETA.
29155,Sheldon,And now we’ll never know.
29156,Leonard,Well you skip over any attempt to repair your emotional connection and you win back her affection with an empty financial gesture.
29157,Penny,Okay what kind of soup do you want.
29158,Leonard,Did you at least have a good flight down there?
29159,Penny,My limbic system wants to take your pants off.
29160,Leonard,The box says kitchen.
29161,Sheldon,Not at all.
29162,Sheldon,And as an added bonus the word touché comes from fencing. It would be our only opportunity to use it in a non-metaphorical sense.
29163,Penny,Well he knew he was on the breast cam.
29164,Penny,Unbelievable.
29165,Leonard,That was kind of icy. You two okay?
29166,Penny,We are. I mean he sleeps here. But it’s only a matter of time before Sheldon has a bad dream and tries to climb into bed with the Leonard-shaped pile of pillows.
29167,Leonard,Listen guys I’m sorry I don’t mean to be rude but I need to go call Raj’s sister who I love so much. So vastly much.
29168,Penny,Sheldon do you understand the concept of blackmail?
29169,Sheldon,Is it?
29170,Sheldon,The answer is cuddly soldiers with big flat noses. Moving on.
29171,Leonard,So he goes back into rehab?
29172,Leonard,His mother?
29173,Sheldon,Oh no. No. I’ve already had to say good-bye to 11 Dr. Whos.
29174,Penny,Pink wine and pizza bagels? It’s like eighth grade all over again. I am so lucky to have you.
29175,Sheldon,Okay. Here we go. Proton decay. Proton decay.  Proton decay. Proton decay.
29176,Sheldon,Thank you Internet. I’m telling you with the right YouTube video I can give Howard a vasectomy.
29177,Raj,Sheldon I’m begging you. I want to go to this mixer and I don’t want to go alone.
29178,Sheldon,As my relationships with Penny and Amy are currently strained I’m turning to you for female comfort and encouragement.
29179,Sheldon,Get out of town.
29180,Leonard,He’s right I was thinking of the lower flermin.
29181,Sheldon,Perhaps two. I’d like to master the craft.
29182,Raj,I just got her a couple of things. She gives me things too.
29183,Howard,I wish we could do more stuff without Sheldon.
29184,Howard,Please Bernadette. Let me leave with my dignity.
29185,Sheldon,That I couldn’t do it?
29186,Raj,Easy. Sleeping with Penny.
29187,Sheldon,Oh of course.
29188,Sheldon,Please don’t hurt my friend.
29189,Leonard,When I take a girl out on a date and I do she knows she’s been dated. Capital D. Bold face underline like Day-ted. I think I might have a little concussion I’m going to go lay down for a while good night.
29190,Leonard,Yeah no yeah wow I’m sorry. That must’ve been the last thing you wanted to hear.
29191,Penny,Okay.
29192,Leonard,Okay I am setting the dials for January 10th 2328. Here we go into the future.  That was fun.
29193,Sheldon,You know I have a good mind to stop paying my taxes. It’s too bad I enjoy doing them so much. The Air Force did it again. They’re erasing our lives.
29194,Sheldon,I believe what you’re doing is using humour to avoid vulnerability.
29195,Penny,You are. You don’t get to decide when I’m ready to say I love you!
29196,Sheldon,Why don’t I let my hair grow out? Um why don’t I start wearing Birkenstocks and uh uh seeking validation of my opinions by asking can you dig it?
29197,Howard,Don’t know why he’s so grumpy. I got mistaken for that guy in Life of Pi once and I’m still floating.
29198,Sheldon,My spidey-sense tells me this has something to do with Penny.
29199,Sheldon,How dare you.
29200,Leonard,I see.
29201,Sheldon,I know. I can see the shadow of your feet under the door.
29202,Penny,Uh probably. It’s hard to say. She kind of had an ear of corn in her mouth.
29203,Raj,No you’re displaying a shocking ignorance of the subject matter. Mummies and zombies are the exact same thing.
29204,Leonard,You did everything you could.
29205,Penny,Okay here’s the protocol you and I are still friends and you stop saying coitus.
29206,Sheldon,Fine.
29207,Penny,Sorry he’s really good.
29208,Howard,Nevertheless this will be reflected in her tip.
29209,Penny,All right hang on. We can figure this out. Let’s just go over your expenses. How much is your rent?
29210,Howard,Really? The only thing I’ve learned in the last two hours is that American men love drinking beer pee too often and have trouble getting erections.
29212,Penny,Yeah I know who he is. I watch Dancing with the Stars.
29213,Penny,Wait what?
29214,Sheldon,I open the chest.
29215,Penny,Take off your clothes.
29216,Sheldon,Which do you think she’d prefer? Because I checked the Sheep and Wool Festival Web site and there’s only 8000 tickets left.
29217,Sheldon,Ah then you may find Zazzles a little cloying.
29219,Penny,That’s great.
29220,Howard,That’s what he said to me.
29222,Howard,You’re not helping.
29223,Penny,Is the point that you don’t know when to let something go?
29224,Sheldon,Boy teenagers.
29225,Raj,Ew.
29226,Penny,Okay this place does look pretty good.
29227,Howard,Okay I see where this is going. Fine I’ll have sex with him.
29228,Leonard,Want some Chinese food?
29229,Raj,Can I get anyone anything at all?
29230,Sheldon,Don’t forget his genetic predisposition towards addiction.
29231,Sheldon,You’re healthy. You have a job in the sciences. I’ve got to say if this credit report comes back good you’re the frontrunner.
29232,Sheldon,Oh good I got it right. Are you upset?
29233,Penny,Okay wait are we talking one-night stand or do we want to get him into a relationship?
29234,Sheldon,That’s awfully personal.
29235,Leonard,Look maybe it is a long shot but sometimes long shots happen. Luke Skywalker was only given one chance to destroy the Death Star. He had to get a torpedo into an exhaust port that was only two meters wide but with the help of The Force he… wow I can feel you hating me right now.
29236,Sheldon,Pastries such as bearclaws?
29237,Sheldon,Hmm.
29238,Penny,Mmm no it isn’t.
29239,Howard,Why? You writing a book?
29240,Sheldon,Yes and I have a theory why. Because of your lactose intolerance you switched over to soy milk. Soy contains estrogen-mimicking compounds. I think your morning Cocoa Puffs are turning you into a hysterical woman.
29241,Leonard,Just Bilbo Baggins’ sword over there.
29242,Penny,I know I know.
29243,Penny,Oh. I’m so sorry.
29244,Leonard,Yeah. They do that when you set it on easy.
29245,Leonard,Thanks.
29246,Penny,You killed my pig?
29247,Sheldon,Yeah but what about the Chinese research team? They found it.
29248,Penny,Oh let’s see how can I explain this um they don’t know how to use their shields.
29249,Leonard,No backsies.
29250,Leonard,If by cool you mean willing to yes. If by cool you mean cool clearly you’ve never seen me play the cello.
29251,Sheldon,No I don’t.
29252,Raj,This was nice.
29253,Sheldon,I always tell people if you have only one day in Los Angeles make it a train day.
29254,Sheldon,A customer service representative with an Indian accent will create the impression we’re a vast enterprise that uses overseas call centres.
29255,Sheldon,You know right now at the back of this line there’s a movie fan like you who’s not going to get in because this person simply doesn’t care. Yeah well 61 years ago there was another person at the back of the line and her name was Rosa Parks.
29256,Sheldon,Oh yes. In fact he said I’m fine I don’t care. And he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal.
29257,Raj,Can I see your stitches?
29258,Leonard,An orang-u-tan?
29259,Sheldon,Penny meant if he were a purple leprechaun. Penny forgot to use the subjunctive.
29260,Leonard,No I do and that’s why I hid it.
29261,Sheldon,You know Penny there’s something that occurs in beehives you might find interesting. Occasionally a new queen will arrive while the old queen is still in power. When this happens the old queen must either locate to a new hive or engage in a battle to the death until only one queen remains.
29262,Penny,We’re gonna have Anything Can Happen Thursday you’re gonna tell me all about your science stuff and I’m gonna complain about my movie and we’re gonna support each other because that’s what friends do.
29263,Sheldon,I have to make pee-pee.
29264,Raj,Hold on. We do that all the time. You and I work together and play together.
29265,Leonard,Hi.
29266,Leonard,I’m sorry what was that? I had a little stroke after oral.
29267,Sheldon,Where?
29268,Howard,The living room appears to be empty.
29269,Leonard,Now that I’m actually about to go out with Penny I’m not excited I’m nauseous.
29270,Sheldon,Don’t think like that you’re not going to die alone.
29271,Penny,Hey are we talking about me or are we talking about Thor?
29272,Leonard,Mother remember when I was complaining that you don’t communicate with me enough?
29273,Leonard,Yeah well when I die you can rent a bounce house.
29274,Penny,Well good job. Now she hates me. Ugh.
29275,Raj,Look I care about you a lot but we are very different people.
29276,Leonard,Thank you.
29277,Sheldon,So we can communicate through the wall.
29278,Leonard,Okay we need to talk.
29279,Raj,You know India?
29281,Penny,Oh Hellblazer. What’s this about?
29282,Leonard,Yeah. It’s good to see you too. Here you go.
29283,Raj,Did he help you make a decision about the movie?
29284,Leonard,Yes.
29285,Penny,Okay. Thank you.
29286,Leonard,Very cool congratulations.
29287,Leonard,When do we leave?
29288,Howard,Uncle Howard. Cinnamon’s here for her sleepover party.
29289,Sheldon,Oh boy. I picked the wrong day to wear my good robot T-shirt.
29291,Sheldon,Hawaii is a former leper colony on top of an active volcano where the disappointing ending to Lost was filmed. Mahalo for nothing Hawaii.
29292,Sheldon,I did.
29293,Raj,Sheldon if this is too much we can stop.
29294,Sheldon,We could call it Nuevo Cherusalem.
29295,Sheldon,I sense you’re making a joke but Bozeman does have a comedy club called The Loony Bin so do not forward my mail there.
29296,Leonard,I’m pretty sure her name’s Lalita.
29297,Howard,Great. That makes one of you. Okay we have a lot to do and not much time to do it. Bernadette you’re on corn gravy and yam detail. Amy you’re on rolls cranberries and making sure Bernadette stays away from the marshmallows. That’s right I see you. Okay if you have any questions I’ll be over here basting my ass off. Focus is key.
29298,Raj,And I told you he bit me.
29299,Sheldon,This is not your office. It hasn’t been assigned yet.
29300,Leonard,Great.
29301,Leonard,Oh I just ran out of patience with Sheldon’s nonsense.
29302,Sheldon,I’m Sheldon.
29303,Penny,Whoa.
29304,Penny,Whoa! That is very cool.
29305,Leonard,Well yeah one of us has to keep an open mind.
29306,Penny,Hi. Sorry. Sheldon would like to say something to you.
29307,Sheldon,Now that Leonard’s made me aware of how high the genetic stakes are we have to face the fact that none of you are suitable mates for my sister.
29308,Leonard,No I don’t.
29309,Raj,That’s two dude. Write your own jokes.
29310,Leonard,Really? Great!
29311,Penny,Oh sweetie you can’t machine wash these. They’ll be ruined.
29312,Raj,I’m telling you Leonard video slot machines free drinks brought to us by a bosomy barmaid and all you can eat shrimp for $3.95. Disneyland can suck it. This is the real happiest place on earth.
29313,Penny,Ooh ooh it’s the comic book store. All right come on that’s where we have to go.
29314,Leonard,She’s not Catwoman she’s just a generic cat.
29315,Raj,Okay first off I want to thank you all so much for coming. Howard is here to interpret for Emily and to take notes.
29316,Sheldon,Two.
29317,Sheldon,I want a cookie Meemaw.
29318,Penny,Oh hi.
29319,Howard,What else do we know about him?
29320,Raj,Run. Run run run. Don’t look back.
29321,Penny,Where did you get a ring?
29322,Penny,So then during my afternoon shift I spilled an entire tray of drinks on myself.
29323,Raj,Before you finish is this a story about patience and waiting or just another reminder that you went to space?
29324,Sheldon,Well hello.
29325,Sheldon,And that’s exactly what I did. I found a lot of someones.
29326,Sheldon,Oh well my new friend’s name was Eric. Um Amy lips tasted like the brownie we had for dessert. Oh and the banjo-playing conductor was missing a finger but he made up for it with his can-do attitude.
29327,Sheldon,More than anything.
29328,Howard,A successful quest. Now let’s go find a gas station with a clean bathroom.
29329,Leonard,There see? Problem solved.
29330,Penny,Okay now I see the giant squid head. 
29331,Penny,Can you believe it’s been eight years?
29332,Sheldon,You own a smoking monkey?
29333,Penny,Oh I am so sorry.
29334,Raj,Yeah screw it. I’m going in.
29335,Raj,Oh oh what about that tubby girl in the Sailor Moon costume at Comic-con?
29337,Penny,Yeah no one cares. Did you help me out or not?
29338,Leonard,Hey Howard I need to tell you something.
29339,Penny,Toad of truth? Is that a physics thing?
29340,Sheldon,I don’t think thatqualifies as a mystery we all knew what we were doing.
29341,Raj,I don’t think this kind of wrestling has a bell.
29342,Leonard,Why did he think you’re the lead scientist? It was my idea.
29343,Howard,Twenty minutes a day completely unaccounted for.
29344,Sheldon,Of course he’s right. You and I both know how hard it is growing up without a father. That’s why I’m confident you’re gonna be the best dad you can be.
29345,Leonard,Nothing with quarks.
29346,Sheldon,Not bad? It’s horrible. I mean you hear stories about this sort of thing but you never think it’ll happen to you.
29348,Leonard,No. Which will make me miserable which is usually Sheldon’s job.
29349,Sheldon,Well I’m sorry.
29350,Sheldon,Oh Lord I think it’s about to burst!  On the other hand it might have been the Brussels sprouts.
29351,Penny,You know what? Fine. Do whatever you want.
29352,Raj,Great. We can still make it to Comic-Con.
29353,Raj,I don’t sound like that.
29354,Penny,You know what hang on. What if Sheldon had no choice but to be respectful?
29355,Sheldon,Well that’s certainly amusing but I have no interest.
29356,Sheldon,Fine what do you want to eliminate and who gets the extra dumpling.
29357,Leonard,Before I tell you will you promise to try and be happy for me and keep any concerns you have to yourself?
29358,Raj,That’s for me Ramon Julio Jesus and Rodrigo to know and you to find out.
29359,Raj,Thanks again for letting me crash girls’ night.
29360,Sheldon,Haughty derision it is.
29361,Sheldon,That may be true but Dr. Nowitzki’s just a friend. In fact I wouldn’t have even noticed she’s a woman if she hadn’t worn that bathing suit that highlighted her bosom.
29362,Sheldon,What are you doing down there?
29363,Penny,What about your weird relationship with him?
29365,Penny,That’s only for when you’re sick.
29366,Penny,Sounds like you have company.
29367,Raj,Howard? Howard? It’s me it’s just me.
29368,Penny,So it’s fine with you if I’m not smart.
29369,Penny,Mm-hmm.
29370,Sheldon,Well I hope it’s with a third good option because these first two buh.
29371,Penny,You’re kidding.
29372,Raj,Four.
29373,Sheldon,Can you read them back?
29374,Leonard,Aren’t there any other options? There’s not a lot of room it’s gonna be uncomfortable.
29375,Raj,But I never will.
29376,Raj,That what that’s for? In India the lid just touches the cheese. Of course we also have rampant poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera so a little cardboard in our cheese is no biggie.
29377,Leonard,Fine. Let’s go. I think you’ll find my work pretty interesting. I’m attempting to replicate the dark matter signal found in sodium iodide crystals by the Italians.
29378,Leonard,Let’s just do this. Guys ready to push?
29379,Raj,I think it shows a lot of character.
29380,Penny,Yeah why not?
29381,Sheldon,My mother gave it to me and I had been thinking about giving it to you but then we broke up.
29382,Howard,Hey it was match point.
29383,Penny,Okay. 101 Totally Cool Science Experiments for Kids.
29384,Leonard,Yeah. Maybe you and I can do something fun that weekend.
29385,Leonard,Not exactly. But she said she was gonna miss me and she gave me this.
29386,Sheldon,They work for SHIELD which is a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government. Do you work for a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government?
29387,Sheldon,And it’s not just an MRI. The orbitofrontal cortex is lit up because I was thinking of you.
29388,Leonard,Did you know Raj moved out last night?
29389,Leonard,Why don’t you just tell her to leave you alone.
29390,Sheldon,Actually it turns out I can.
29391,Penny,People run in a marathon.
29393,Raj,Without me.
29394,Howard,You know on Game of Thrones Balon Greyjoy received his son’s genitals in a box.
29395,Leonard,I… uh…
29396,Sheldon,How is it imaginary that I keep hearing an octave above Middle C? Is that imaginary? I don’t think so.
29397,Sheldon,Well I’m calling because Thanksgiving is coming up and I wanted to offer you the aquarium tickets.
29398,Sheldon,And we learned that you don’t need an eyeball to do that.
29400,Sheldon,It’s a bio-feedback technique it’s relaxation through brain-wave manipulation I read a paper about it in the Journal of American Neuroscience it was a little sparsely sourced but I think the basic science is valid I probably have it here somewhere.
29401,Sheldon, Penny?
29402,Sheldon,If we’re all through playing mock the flawed technology can we get on with Halo night we were supposed to start at eight it is now 806.
29403,Howard,Not my best first date. Yeah but not my worst either.
29404,Sheldon,I get to write a contract? I say let’s get this party of the first part started.
29405,Leonard,And who got him to try a turkey dog?
29407,Sheldon,Hello.
29408,Sheldon,What? Can’t a man just be happy to see his woman and pat her on her second most erogenous ball-and-socket joint?
29409,Sheldon,Fine. Sorry.
29410,Sheldon,Hang on.
29411,Penny,And you didn’t get your part cut. Yep bunch of old guys rocking out in a band all with erectile dysfunction you didn’t get your part cut!
29412,Leonard,Hmm?
29413,Leonard,Sheldon Howard and I are working with the government on our quantum gyroscope.
29414,Howard,Fine I quit too.
29415,Penny,Hi. How did the intervention go.
29416,Penny,That kind of actress. This sucks.
29417,Sheldon,Nothing. I was acting.
29418,Leonard,Yeah. Right. Sure. The thing is before you guys went out I spoke to him and…
29419,Leonard,What makes you think she wouldn’t have sex with me I’m a male and she’s a female?
29420,Howard,Does anyone have any words they’d like to say about our man of the evening?
29421,Howard,Very well thank you.
29422,Penny,Yeah. It’s all very professional.
29424,Sheldon,Why die. Why did he die? Old told. I was told he was old.
29425,Raj,Oh gets better.
29426,Leonard,I don’t know some time tomorrow morning.
29427,Howard,I don’t want to speak for Leonard.
29428,Sheldon,That’s true. There’s the U.S. Air Force U.S. Department of Defence U.S. Navy you and I are going to jail.
29429,Sheldon,I recently read that during World War Two Joseph Stalin had a research program to create supersoldiers by having women impregnated by gorillas.
29430,Penny,Smoother than you.
29431,Leonard,Oh okay. So what’s up?
29432,Leonard,Will you please take that stupid hat off?
29433,Leonard,I don’t know. How am I supposed to remember all of this.
29434,Howard,No it’s not. She was too beautiful for me.
29435,Howard,Please have a seat.  I’m thinking double wedding!
29436,Raj,You’re wrong. It’s only a matter of time before you fall into Rat-Man’s rat trap.
29437,Sheldon,Show me your citrus peels. Gei wo kan ni jud di zi pei. Show me your citrus peels. Gei wo kan ni jud di zi pei. Show me your…
29438,Sheldon,It was. And even though we’re not allowed back there they can never take today away from us. Unlike my sense of smell which hasn’t returned since the Tasing. No I got nothing.
29439,Leonard,No.
29440,Leonard,Sheldon Lee Cooper I do not have time for this nonsense. Now go put your clothes on get in the car and lets go to work.
29441,Leonard,Any chance you know what it is?
29442,Leonard,How can you walk around with no money?
29443,Raj,Maybe slapped with a fine.
29444,Leonard,Hello.
29446,Penny,Oh you met him at the office Christmas party. He’s married to Nancy.
29447,Sheldon,What?
29448,Howard,Hey come on guys focus. Um uh oh mighty Nicolas Cage tree we thank you for your warning but we are brave warriors and nothing short of death will keep us from our goal.  Oh Lucy’s free after all. See ya.
29449,Leonard,This might not be that bad. Uh you like telling people they’re wrong.
29450,Sheldon,You’ll never believe it. Leonard gave me the most incredible gift a trip to a historic railway and I get to operate an actual locomotive.
29451,Leonard,Sheldon let’s go!
29452,Raj,Well I would never leave you off my list and not just because without you we’re playing fast and loose with the word list.
29453,Penny,Oh. And the Flash shirt is what? Because you’re gonna run really fast?
29454,Raj,Hey it’s not my fault if American women project their fantasies on foreigners with the kind of magical voice that grants wishes.
29455,Penny,Hey my acting class is putting on a play Friday night. I could put you and Amy on the guest list.
29456,Leonard,I just want to say one more thing about this. Just because Penny and I are very different people does not mean that we’re a bad couple.
29457,Leonard,Morning.
29458,Sheldon,No I meant turn right and you missed it. Maybe you do need to know.
29459,Leonard,You bet. I am going to make him apologize for all the crap he pulled on me in school.
29460,Sheldon,So I drink.
29461,Raj,Really? Because every time we’ve talked about unusual animal genitals you’ve always had some pretty strong and controversial opinions.
29462,Sheldon,Great. Wait till you hear about our van.
29463,Penny,I actually knew that.
29464,Sheldon,Of course.
29465,Sheldon,Yeah it’s true. A generation of young scientists are standing on your shoulders.
29466,Penny,Don’t worry about it. Hey after this how about we all go out and do something together?
29467,Howard,My parents are making me choose between money and you. I choose you.  And that necklace yeah that too. But none of those things matter because we have something better. We have love.
29468,Howard,You called the right person. I believe I have the perfect romantic evening for you to give Leonard.
29469,Sheldon,Could you please play the game without commenting on every card?
29470,Leonard,Of course I’ll be back. I live here!
29471,Howard,Sheldon is there a place on this train to get alcohol?
29472,Penny,Okay?
29473,Penny,Come on.
29474,Leonard,Eh uh well I was wondering if you’re not too busy um uh if if you’d be interested in telling me where the restroom is?
29475,Sheldon,I’ll give you a plan right now. Step one open comic book store. Step two start rumour this comic book store gives you genital warts. Step three buy a big bag to put the money in.
29476,Raj,Not yet but her underwater photo shoot was an embarrassment.
29477,Leonard,You really are a mean little man.
29478,Penny,Okay we should we should go.
29479,Penny,Okay so you absolutely should talk to him look I know Leonard values you as a friend and he told me himself that without your little idea there’s no way he could have come up with this whole experiment thing.
29480,Leonard,Yes.
29481,Leonard,Bye buddy. Sheldon?
29482,Howard,Penny please please promise me you won’t tell anybody about this.
29483,Raj,Sorry I started without you. I’m a little nervous. It’s been a long time since I’ve been on a date.
29484,Sheldon,Sorry I’m moving slowly.
29485,Leonard,Done.
29486,Leonard,So you sort of act as a carbohydrate delivery system.
29487,Leonard,I had to ask. You didn’t have to say yes.
29488,Penny,All right what’s going on?
29489,Sheldon,You know the holidays are just around the corner. Maybe he wants to see if he can lodge the other testicle up there.
29490,Leonard,I love you.
29491,Sheldon,Well of course. Scissors cuts paper paper covers rock rock crushes lizard lizard poisons Spock Spock smashes scissors scissors decapitates lizard lizard eats paper paper disproves Spock Spock vaporizes rock and as it always has rock crushes scissors.
29492,Penny,He’s having problems with Stephanie?
29493,Howard,What do you suppose she meant by that?
29494,Leonard,Oh Sheldon stay.
29495,Raj,He’ll have a Shirley Temple.
29496,Sheldon,You mean dating?
29497,Sheldon,I’m confused. I thought since our reconciliation I was your friend in this group.
29498,Penny,Oh let me help you up.
29499,Raj,Should we try to console him?
29500,Raj,Whatever dude. The point is Leonard’s got one and you don’t.
29501,Penny,See? You don’t have to be mean to get what you want.
29502,Howard,Wait did Amy make her spinach dip?
29503,Penny,What am I doing?
29504,Leonard,Really?
29505,Raj,250 million years.
29506,Howard,Oh sure cut the foreigner in half there’s a billion more where he came from.
29507,Sheldon,Oh look who’s in favour of compromise the woman who married Leonard Hofstadter.
29508,Leonard,Well where’s that information been this whole time?
29509,Sheldon,My apologies. Raj Howard I’d like you to meet Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.
29510,Leonard,Not specifically but uh I did tell her that I had feelings.
29511,Raj,Leonard I I’m scared again.
29512,Penny,Okay.
29513,Leonard,Yes we are. And we’re about to go to bed.
29514,Leonard,What?
29515,Penny,How the hell did you get them up on that telephone wire?
29516,Raj,So what are you guys doing later? Stuart and I were thinking of going out for a drink.
29517,Leonard,Uh guys I found an article here that says you can do CPR on birds.
29518,Penny,Oh look it’s a female. You can see all the eggs. 
29519,Leonard,Yes.
29520,Leonard,Uh don’t lower yourself to their level.
29521,Penny,Well thank you for a really cool evening.
29522,Howard,Why?
29523,Leonard,Hey Alex and call me Leonard. Dr. Hofstadter is my father. And my mother. And my sister. And our cat. Although I’m pretty sure Dr. Boots Hofstadter’s degree was honorary.
29524,Raj,Seriously you don’t even have to stop the car. Anything under ten miles an hour and I can combat-roll into the street.
29525,Leonard,As you can see detoxing can get pretty ugly let’s give them some privacy.
29526,Sheldon,Brobdingnagian.
29527,Leonard,What?
29528,Penny,We did it.
29529,Penny,Oh Zack. Hey.
29530,Penny,Where are all your friends?
29531,Leonard,This time it’s your fault.
29532,Leonard,All right fine. What about that really long hug? What did that mean?
29533,Sheldon,Leonard the people at Nintendo can only go so far in helping us recreate an actual athletic experience. We have to do our part too.  That was uncalled for but I’ll play along. Ow! I had an unusual experience with Amy last night.
29534,Penny,Go ahead eat it. I dare you
29535,Sheldon,I thought you left a long time ago.
29536,Leonard,Yeah I’m familiar with Bert and Ernie.
29537,Sheldon,You know what this is? Yeah and I reserve this word for those rare instances when it’s truly deserved. This is malarkey.
29538,Leonard,That’s a big deal.
29539,Leonard,Really? ‘Cause I went to four years of college and five years of grad school that never happened once.
29540,Howard,Oh you’re where that bill goes.
29541,Howard,Howard my father cut me off. I have to get my money back for this.
29542,Sheldon,I’m always honest with Amy. The other day she said she was self-conscious about the beauty mark on her shoulder and I said you know you can call that a beauty mark all you want. When there’s hair growing out of it that’s a mole.
29543,Leonard,Oh my God they’re just making you use your vacation days.
29544,Penny,Oh I do not believe that.
29545,Penny,Um it has seat warmers.
29546,Penny,Are you telling the truth?
29547,Raj,Okay.
29548,Sheldon,No.
29549,Howard,Oh I see you’re reading Saga.
29550,Sheldon,Is that the attitude that helped you get Penny?
29551,Howard,Can you believe it? Little Priya’s one of the lead attorneys for the biggest car company in India.
29552,Raj,All right it’s almost game time. Get it? Game of Thrones game time?
29553,Penny,Well all I know is he says they hurt his feet.
29554,Penny,Oh hey.
29555,Leonard,Can I see?
29556,Sheldon,And if they ever come out with a game called Words with People You Once Worked With you’ll be off to the races.
29557,Sheldon,It’s about how she made my life better. Consider the lyrics. I was living like half a man. Then I couldn’t love but now I can. More soul than I ever had. I love the way you soften my life.”
29558,Sheldon,There’s nothing happy about it. I’m being given credit that I don’t deserve.
29559,Sheldon,You can’t return it. Howard wiped his bottom with the warranty.
29560,Sheldon,Plateful.
29561,Sheldon,Cut! Take 47.
29562,Sheldon,And I’m sorry. But that behaviour is beyond the pale and cannot be tolerated. We are no longer friends.
29563,Leonard,Do it.
29564,Penny,Well breakups or whatever the hell this is can be tough.
29565,Sheldon,Okay but don’t punch me.
29566,Penny,Nothing. Nothing.
29567,Sheldon,Please. Ha-ha Oh.
29568,Leonard,Is that Bert?
29569,Leonard,Pretty good.
29570,Leonard,Gets us out of our heads. You get in your head you start to overthink overanalyze obsess you worry. That’s not what we’re doing tonight. Tonight we’re just throwing a ball at some pins.
29571,Sheldon,Incorrect. Obviously the answer is cheese Danish.
29572,Sheldon,It’s appreciated. And if you ever manage to find a woman again I’ll be glad to return the favour.
29573,Sheldon,That’s remarkable. If pepperoni were an explosive substance you could replace German shepherds at our nation’s airports.
29574,Penny,You know what I’ve met Bert. Isn’t he an indicator of life on other planets?
29575,Sheldon,They can’t function without me. I’m the social glue that holds this little group together. You’re welcome.
29576,Sheldon,See that’s exactly what happened to me except that I said it on purpose and I have no regrets.
29577,Leonard,Penny and I have dinner reservations that night but any other time no.
29578,Leonard,People do it all the time.
29579,Sheldon,Excellent. And just an FYI as I am the expedition’s team leader protocol dictates that be phrased fine sir. But don’t worry there will be a briefing.
29580,Sheldon,The ice caps are melting Leonard. In the future swimming isn’t going to be optional. But you do bring up an interesting point. I don’t have to break new ground here I’m sure much of the research already exists.
29581,Sheldon,Yeah a little kid who picked the wrong format to record The MacNeil/Lehrer Report. Now I also was certain that HD DVD would win out over Blu-ray.
29582,Penny,Oh I don’t know. Remember what happened when I took care of your goldfish?
29583,Penny,Okay I’m gonna go pick up my family. Like an hour and half two hours depending on traffic.
29584,Raj,Did you take a band aid off in front of him?
29585,Penny,Yeah there is.
29586,Sheldon,Let me explain. You see I’m a superior genetic mutation an improvement on the existing mediocre stock.
29587,Penny,Wars.
29588,Penny,What the hell?
29589,Sheldon,You made God sad today Mom.
29590,Sheldon,Uh-oh flashlight went out. I need some batteries. Fellas? Hello? It’s really dark down here.
29591,Raj,How long can he keep this up?
29592,Sheldon,Stuart this is Bert from the Caltech geology lab and this is Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs.
29593,Howard,What happened?
29595,Leonard,Sorry about that.
29596,Leonard,Just try it.
29597,Penny,Sorry.
29598,Sheldon,Of course I’m right What are the odds I’d be wrong twice in one week?
29599,Howard,Uh-huh.
29600,Howard,I’m not happy it’s the medication I can’t stop smiling. 
29601,Sheldon,Had me at flag lost me at football.
29602,Howard,Well uh to paraphrase Shakespeare It’s better to have loved and lost than to stay home every night and download increasingly shameful pornography.
29603,Sheldon,Nonsense. No. Lovey-Dovey doesn’t sleep in a cage. No. Lovey-Dovey sleeps in his very own nest which I’m going to get off the windowsill and put in my room. Isn’t that right LD?  No. Where are you going? Come back Lovey-Dovey! This is your home now! I already ordered 20 pounds of bird feed off of Amazon! He’s gone.
29604,Leonard,What?
29605,Raj,Not as fun as the night we blew up grapes in the microwave. We really have led full lives.
29606,Raj,Teams are fun.
29607,Sheldon,Someone will show.
29608,Leonard,I know but he was my friend first. It’s like she’s stealing him and they’re just having the best time doing all their dumb girly stuff together.
29609,Penny,So are we celebrating anything special tonight?
29610,Sheldon, too late I win.
29611,Penny,I just never knew anyone that died. I had a pet pig when I was a kid. I mean when he died we didn’t have a funeral we had a barbecue.
29612,Sheldon,I guess news travels fast. It’s true a select group of scientists was invited to a weekend symposium at a former home of Richard Feynman and I wasn’t included.
29613,Sheldon,Oh Sunday’s the worst. Everybody’s leaving most of the good panels are over and the only T-shirts they have left are small and XXXXL.
29614,Raj,I’ll tell you what how about we go rock-paper-scissors?
29615,Raj,Hello Michaela.
29616,Penny,Okay don’t judge me. So what do you want to do go to the movies go dancing lay down for a little bit?
29617,Sheldon,Actually we met online.
29618,Leonard,He had Lysine but changed it.
29619,Howard,Why?
29620,Howard,Since when do you go to spin class?
29621,Howard,You know what? That may be it. By the way it isn’t like riding a bike. Like I fell off a few times.
29622,Howard,What you told her?
29623,Sheldon,Boy do I have to urinate.
29624,Leonard,Oh if she was with an Indian guy dressed like a banana that was just my friends Howard and Raj.
29625,Sheldon,All right. Well what should we talk about?
29626,Leonard,No I’m not. I’m bleeding.
29627,Raj,I know. I saw the Tweet.
29628,Raj,She and I are both a little awkward in social situations so this seemed like a good idea.
29629,Penny,What’s wrong?
29630,Sheldon,Hello.
29631,Sheldon,I want you to tell me that Howard is being mean to me for no reason.
29632,Leonard,I believe you.
29633,Sheldon,Uh-huh.
29634,Sheldon, Penny.
29635,Penny,I’m the dumplings.
29636,Penny,Wait you had to leave the state because your roommate was having sex?
29638,Sheldon,Hang on. This time do it with me so I can make sure there’s no monkey business.
29639,Penny,Really? Oh great. I mean aw. Okay I gotta go.
29640,Leonard,Stop it!
29641,Penny,What do you have a safe deposit box for?
29642,Howard,That would be amazing.
29643,Leonard,What?
29644,Leonard,This is cool. When was the last time you and I built something together?
29645,Sheldon,And there goes my list.
29646,Leonard,Look Sheldon I know it’s in the agreement and if you turn into a zombie I promise I will not kill you. In fact I’ll even let you eat my brains. But I am taking Penny to Switzerland.
29647,Sheldon,You’re holding a Japanese puzzle box which takes ten precise moves to open. First locate the panel with the diamond pattern and slide the centre portion one millimetre to the left. Then on the opposite end of the box slide the entire panel down two millimetres. You’ll hear a slight click.
29648,Leonard,Sheldon this is not your home.
29649,Sheldon,Okay now you’re just showing off.
29650,Sheldon,For your information I was asking her about the next Star Trek movie.
29651,Sheldon,That’s probably my fault. She may have heard about my cool Dumbledore costume.
29652,Penny,I know. Thank you.
29654,Leonard,Okay. I’ll confirm the travel arrangements in the morning.
29655,Sheldon,Oh. Who knows?
29656,Leonard,I still can’t get over the fact that she got a big movie part. Not that I care what my ex-girlfriend’s up to ’cause I don’t.
29658,Sheldon,Was that sarca..
29659,Sheldon,Include me in what? Is there a plot afoot? I’ll have no truck with plots.
29660,Leonard,Because well Batman has the secret.
29661,Leonard,Oh no no no I know this. Uh hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks?
29662,Leonard,Hey Sheldon’s not here so we are going to put on music and dance in our underwear.
29663,Leonard,Oh I don’t even know. I just liked his name. Theo Sassler. Okay and look at this. I even got a change maker. How much change you want little lady?
29664,Sheldon,Amy just hurt my feelings. I want to break up with her.
29665,Leonard,I’m walking away from you now.
29666,Raj,Hello.
29667,Sheldon,Penny you’re not trained. You’re not licensed. Most importantly you don’t have access to my haircut records.
29668,Sheldon,Me? No. No I’m not that kind of doctor.
29669,Penny,A shower.
29670,Leonard,Did your sister say anything when you got home last night?
29672,Raj,Oh snap.
29673,Howard,Ooh fire demon. Sheldon’s turning up the heat.
29674,Leonard,Listen I need to talk to you about something.
29675,Leonard,He’ll never make it in time.
29676,Penny,Okay good because there’s this one guy I used to date who’s about to be force-fed wine and cheese if he doesn’t get to the point.
29677,Sheldon,Fine if that’s what it takes to go on their dumb trip.
29678,Sheldon,It won’t be as good.
29679,Sheldon,What if they simply don’t excite me?
29680,Howard,Because instead of being in the telescope room I was busy making you guys home made jam for the holidays.
29681,Howard,How hard did she stomp?
29682,Howard,Actually I’m single now.
29683,Sheldon,Bah bam bum-bum bah bum bum. This song is never going to stop. Have you ever dealt with something so relentlessly irritating?
29684,Raj,Uh he’s Indian. We’ve already got one of those. Ooh we should find a nice Latino really round us out.
29685,Penny,Oh gee okay.
29686,Sheldon,You see the danger was that I might under or over-reciprocate but I have devised a foolproof plan. See I will open her gift to me first and then excuse myself feigning digestive distress.
29687,Leonard,What? Why?
29688,Leonard,That’s a lot of shoes you ordered.
29689,Raj,It’s okay. I can’t get mad at your feelings.
29690,Sheldon,Come on Mother you know why I can’t accept the award. With all due respect I don’t think praying will help. No I have not heard the song Jesus Take the Wheel. No no no no no no no you don’t need to start singing it. Yes I’ll buy it on the iTunes Mother. Good-bye Mother.  Hello.
29691,Penny,What good is it if you don’t use it?
29692,Howard,I don’t know if I’d say you… oh.
29693,Leonard,The bird’s still there?
29694,Penny,Fine.
29695,Raj,Hang on.
29696,Leonard,I’m on it. 15 years from now we’ll make guacamole together.
29697,Leonard,It’s a little late but I’ll take it.
29698,Penny,And that’s why you get an iPad helicopter.
29699,Sheldon,Do you know that the word wiener comes from the German name of the Austrian capital Vienna or Wien?
29700,Leonard,Yeah mission accomplished.
29701,Leonard,Are we ready to order?
29702,Sheldon,Am I missing something or isn’t that the part she was born to play?
29703,Leonard,See ya. Still can’t believe she’s going out with me.
29704,Sheldon,It will take me a few days to get settled. After I do I will e-mail you detailed PDFs containing diagrams and instructions that will guide you through packing and shipping the rest of my possessions to Bozeman Montana. In the meantime please forward my mail.
29705,Leonard,Seven six.
29706,Howard,That’s right. She’s with us. Guys like that are so pathetic.
29707,Penny,Leonard guess what I’m a level three warrior.
29708,Sheldon,I’m glad we’re finally getting to do something together just the two of us.
29709,Sheldon,I have multiple restraining orders that say otherwise.
29710,Howard,We can still be swashers.
29711,Leonard,Sorry.
29712,Raj,I I hope we didn’t make the puzzles too hard.
29713,Sheldon,You told me it’s mind-blowing so my mind is going into it pre-blown. And once a mind is pre-blown it cannot be re-blown.
29714,Raj,How about the girl from the Wonder Years?
29716,Sheldon,Bartenders are supposed to have people skills.
29717,Leonard,Three four months.
29718,Sheldon,Oh wow!
29719,Howard,Can I say I ruined you for white men?
29720,Howard,The guy’s a genius. Maybe you weren’t challenging enough for him.
29721,Sheldon,Now you just being silly. Wolverine’s never displayed the slightest interest in helping others prevent prostate cancer.  Hello. Yes the elevator’s out of order you’ll have to use the stairs. Of course you can. Pizza dates back to the 16th century while the first elevator was not installed until 1852. That means that for over 300 years people carried pizzas up stairs. Be part of that proud tradition.
29722,Leonard,What good is money gonna do if we inadvertently bring about Armageddon?
29723,Howard,Yeah I read your paper online. That technique for creating a new heavy element is inspired.
29724,Sheldon,It sucks to be you.
29725,Raj,Yes exactly. Where is the coin? Why don’t you look in your pockets? I slipped them in there earlier today.
29726,Leonard,Our gaming room. I was gonna put a scented candle in it.
29727,Sheldon,That’s curious. If there’s no one here why are there two glasses of wine on the table?
29728,Howard,That sounds amazing. First movie I’m watching Annie.
29729,Penny,Oh my God no.
29730,Penny,Oh good for him.
29731,Sheldon,I have good news.
29732,Sheldon,You’re right you did kind of kill the mood.
29733,Leonard,Check.
29734,Sheldon,Fine. I was Spock. Are you and Leonard friends with benefits.
29735,Penny,I need some guinea pigs.
29736,Penny,Oh yes. Hi hi. I’m sorry. I didn’t know you had company. I don’t want to impose.
29737,Sheldon,Yes well if we lived in a world where slow-moving xenon produced light then you’d be correct. Also pigs would fly my derriere would produce cotton candy and The Phantom Menace would be a timeless classic.
29738,Sheldon,Well I’m not needed at both places at the same time. And I can also free up extra hours with simple tricks such as using a minimal amount of words to convey my point.
29739,Penny,What heavy machinery? Let’s just start.
29740,Penny,What what’s all this?
29741,Sheldon,Hmm what can we do that’s fun?
29742,Sheldon,Oh we’ll make the puzzles extremely challenging to eliminate unworthy candidates.
29743,Leonard,Yup.
29744,Sheldon,I have mixed feelings about doing interviews. I like the part where I talk. I do not like the part where the other man talks.
29745,Raj,Howard the poor thing just got home from work. Let me get you a glass of wine. I’ll cook dinner.
29746,Penny,No. All your little secrets are fine.
29747,Sheldon,In your pyjamas?
29748,Howard,I don’t see why not.
29749,Sheldon,Sure you do. I was telling you both the story about how Haiti and Lichtenstein discovered they had the same flag. It was at the Summer Olympics of 1936 and two plucky nations…
29750,Penny,Alright remember when I auditioned for that workshop production of Rent but I didn’t get it and I couldn’t figure out why?
29751,Howard,It’s all over her Facebook page.
29752,Penny,Ah yeah Grandma by Calvin Klein. You know the last time I got a hand written letter it was from someone who told me I parked like a blind person.
29753,Leonard,As is the company.
29754,Raj,Whatever. It would have been nice to hear it from you.
29755,Howard,Anything can happen.
29756,Penny,You know what? It’s it’s none of my business. If you want to sleep with Sheldon’s doctor buddy right after we stopped seeing each other go for it.
29757,Raj,Missy do you enjoy pajamas?
29758,Sheldon,If I did would I find any?
29759,Leonard,Why?
29760,Howard,How else am I supposed to talk to the Human Resources lady?
29761,Leonard,You okay?
29762,Sheldon,Tea is for when I’m upset. I’m not upset. The university’s forcing me to work with Kripke. I’m outraged.
29763,Leonard,Yes.
29764,Leonard,Well you know it’s Comic Con. I’m Lion-O from ThunderCats.
29765,Sheldon,Don’t listen to him he’s still light headed from all the Irish whiskey and pickled eggs in his system.
29766,Sheldon, Raj? I need to sleep here tonight.
29767,Raj,Everybody knows genetic diversity produces the strongest offspring. Why not put a little mocha in the family latte.
29769,Sheldon,It’s not a present it’s the present. Look. There’s you and me. There’s Penny and Amy. We’re playing Pictionary. In the present.
29770,Howard,Oh hey guys. Come in.
29771,Leonard,Lucky bastard.
29772,Howard,Which would have been two and a half if they ordered the souffle when they sat down.
29773,Sheldon,Aw Mom.
29774,Raj,Does the smart-ass know that Terminator was actually ripped off from an Outer Limits script called Demon With a Glass Hand by Harlan Ellison?
29775,Leonard,Well I don’t love it but if you really want to take this job I’ll find a way to deal with it.
29776,Penny,To take me.
29777,Raj,So the movie’s not as bad as you thought?
29778,Howard,Oh yeah we hang out all the time.
29779,Penny,This sucks.
29780,Leonard,Thank you.
29781,Penny,How?
29782,Sheldon,That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her.
29783,Penny,Hello Sheldon. Come on in.
29784,Sheldon,If you knew what you were doing there wouldn’t be a space toilet where my coffee table should be.
29785,Sheldon,Dare I say loco? Oh and Amy guess what? The conductor said as soon as he gets off work he can come back to the bed and breakfast and play his banjo for us.
29786,Howard,This looks terrible. She she’s gonna know.
29787,Leonard,You’re good at revenge how do we get him back?
29788,Sheldon,It’s my pre-packed disaster evacuation bag. Recommended by the department of homeland security. And Sarah Connor.
29789,Penny,Really?
29790,Sheldon,No uh no I’m sorry. Who’s talking about Leonard and Alex?
29791,Howard,Excuse me. I happen to be very comfortable with my masculinity.
29792,Sheldon,Oh who’s the real astronaut?
29793,Sheldon,Awful. They’re allowing me to move on from string theory but they made me a junior professor and are requiring me to teach a class.
29795,Sheldon,Was that sarcasm?
29796,Howard,Sorry I left them in my turban.
29797,Leonard,Wait did you say wait?
29798,Sheldon,Oh that was wildly carcinogenic. Anyway it’s too bad you’re no longer entitled to the full benefits of my friendship because I happen to be extremely prepared for such an emergency. Please try not to see anything by this light. It’s not for you.
29799,Raj,Do you want to do this or not?
29800,Howard,I have to say I am happy with your OBGYN.
29801,Penny,What do you mean?
29802,Penny,Hey uh so I’ve been thinking about it and I want to take the job.
29803,Penny,How? You can’t force someone to like you.
29804,Leonard,So aren’t you going to go talk to her?
29805,Sheldon,That’s unacceptable. We’re supposed to be given written notice.
29806,Leonard,Excuse me but if I did such a bad job then why do we already have orders?
29807,Raj,Great. Now how are you going to settle it hmm? There is no way to determine the species of the cricket without examining it.
29808,Sheldon,And we’ll get to have fun interactions with our customers. Like this isn’t a library buy it or get out.
29809,Sheldon,I heard a woman laughing.
29810,Leonard,Well that’s not your fault.
29811,Leonard,Yeah I guessed that.
29812,Raj,Why?
29813,Leonard,I know what the anthropic principle is.
29814,Sheldon,Oh I wish it were that simple. You see I don’t spend much time here and so I’ve never really chosen a place to sit.
29815,Leonard,Yes.
29816,Sheldon,It took you four years to get through High School?
29817,Leonard,Get out.
29818,Howard,What do you mean?
29819,Raj,You are not my superior.
29820,Raj,Do you think I have a shot with Penny?
29821,Sheldon,How nice. Here are some topics that interest me quantum mechanics trains flags.
29822,Penny,Run to India.
29823,Leonard,I can’t do that.
29824,Penny,No. That’s fine but there’s a difference between being tough and telling your friend her new pants look like a saggy diaper.
29825,Leonard,Who do you think carries Sheldon to bed when he falls asleep in front of the TV?
29826,Sheldon,I believe it is. The combination of the Star Trek reference and the play on words involving the double-meaning of the verb to go suggests that Leonard is humorously mocking your efforts in space plumbing.
29827,Leonard,She’s enjoying living with you and she didn’t want it to end early.
29828,Sheldon,My fists are not up here because I’m milking a giant invisible cow. They’re up to beat an apology out of you.
29829,Sheldon,There it is. What if someone asks?
29830,Leonard,Really? Why would you say that?
29831,Raj,Hang on.
29832,Leonard,I guess we are. So what’s going on?
29833,Sheldon,You’re wearing modern underwear?
29834,Sheldon,Would you two like to stay and play trains with me?
29835,Penny,Uh just wear something comfortable.
29836,Penny,Okay listen when Leonard comes out he is not gonna feel great so please don’t give him a hard time.
29837,Penny,Okay help me out here. Why does he love this show so much?
29838,Sheldon,No we turned our stereo down by sending a signal around the world via the internet.
29839,Leonard,Are you gonna eat that whole pie?
29840,Leonard,I’ll give you a hint. We’re watching Daredevil.
29841,Raj,Well the cleaning lady was there but she doesn’t like me. You need any help?
29842,Leonard,So what’s the problem?
29843,Howard,Oh sweet Krishna shake it that-a rupee maker.
29844,Sheldon,Oh. Uh I need to keep my anxiety at the right level so I’m using Darth Vader the Joker and Godzilla’s roar to keep me in that sweet spot. Uh I tried including Taylor Swift in the mix but turns out I love her.
29845,Sheldon,That is a snowy tree cricket. Oecanthus fultoni. I was done with Latin by fifth grade.
29846,Penny,No.
29847,Howard,I did do that. I can be insensitive to other people’s boundaries. Howard would you write that down?
29848,Penny,All right my advice to you is do it at her place so you can leave when you need to uh tell the truth make it quick and be prepared for tears.
29849,Howard,Uh-oh. She wants to meet us.
29850,Sheldon,I’m fine with that.
29851,Raj,Oh yay I have a doctorate in astrophysics and I’m every bit as awesome as the pasty-faced owner of a comic book store.
29852,Penny,Okay that’s the one to beat.
29853,Sheldon,That’s very unlikely Mrs. Koothrappali. If Raj dies it’ll be from frostbite gangrene acute sunburn or being ripped to shreds by a fifteen hundred pound polar bear.
29854,Howard,Sorry papa.
29855,Sheldon,So what are some ways we could set our comic book store apart from the competition?
29856,Penny,Thank you so much for helping us Stuart.
29857,Raj,Come on Sheldon Star Wars.
29858,Sheldon,You know I wonder how she feels about all this artwork.
29859,Leonard,They call themselves Bozites?
29860,Leonard,Here we go.
29861,Sheldon,You don’t get a hey. You get a hmm.
29862,Raj,Actually.
29863,Sheldon,Amy. Oh why didn’t I give her Sleepy Time tea? Amy wait. Getting a turtle meant a great deal to me too.
29864,Sheldon,You know I only have one slot available in my entertainment centre.
29865,Sheldon,What do you think their combined IQ is?
29866,Sheldon,And what is that supposed to mean?
29867,Howard,It’s my father you jerks. Hello Daddy.
29868,Howard,You guys suck.
29869,Sheldon,Your warm and fun-loving nature delights those around you.
29870,Howard,I don’t know. They’re dressed very stylishly. They’re probably stuck-up. This is ridiculous. The next person that walks by no matter who it is they’re the one. We’re gonna die here.
29871,Sheldon,No. Clearly another woman in dire need of ice cream.
29872,Raj,H-h-h-how did we get on me we were mocking Leonard for not moving on. Dude you have totally not moved on.
29873,Raj,What?
29875,Sheldon,How would you feel if I contacted your mother behind your back?
29876,Sheldon,I am not trying to get her back. But out of curiosity what is a way?
29877,Sheldon,You want to bet? Oh great now I’m addicted to gambling.
29879,Howard,Okay um It was a card for your 18th birthday. Inside it said Happy birthday Howard. I love you. Dad. Oh and it was a Far Side card the one where the frog has its tongue stuck to the underside of an airplane. Thinks it’s a fly. Silly frog. So funny.
29880,Penny,Well Sheldon when you’re kissing a girl she expects the attention to be on her.
29881,Sheldon,I’ll look them up. Son of a biscuit.
29882,Sheldon,Why don’t you ask her?
29883,Sheldon,Why? Oh Penny Penny Penny.
29884,Leonard,There’s more to life than sex Raj.
29886,Leonard,Are you ashamed of me?
29887,Raj,Dr. Nowitzki. Good to see you.
29888,Howard,You crimson coward! Oh Leonard wake up you’re missing some very excellent superhero quips.
29889,Penny,Yes. I’ll check flights.
29890,Sheldon,No. No now that was not my point. My point was don’t buy a cat.
29891,Raj,Hold on. Yeah that’s funny.
29892,Leonard,Why are you carrying extras?
29893,Sheldon,All the time.
29894,Raj,Even drunk he’s still smarter than all of us.
29895,Sheldon,You think you’re doing science by cutting up that brain? They could do the same thing at any Quiznos. And they’d offer to toast it for me too.
29896,Howard,And a large number of people will believe it never happened.
29897,Howard,It means I like women as well as their skincare products.
29898,Penny,Okay let’s take a break.
29899,Penny,You’re really a broken toy aren’t you?
29900,Penny,Good good. And then what?
29901,Leonard,Last night me wanting to try that stuff out of the Kama Sutra was that fun for you or kinda racially insensitive?
29902,Sheldon,On your way home will you pick up some orange juice?
29903,Leonard,Bruce Wayne doesn’t make his roommate tie it for him.
29904,Penny,Come on Amy let’s go drink wine and talk about what jerks our boyfriends are.
29905,Leonard,Yeah no I do I use those… uh… just to polish up my… spear-fishing equipment. I spear fish. When I’m not crossbow hunting I spear fish. Uh Penny this is Sheldon’s twin sister Missy. Missy this is our neighbour Penny.
29906,Leonard,And I’m gonna hit the head. That’s what us salty sea dogs say when we have to go pee-pee.
29907,Sheldon,I’m not just fixing my eggs I’m fixing everyone’s eggs.
29908,Howard,Hey Claire.
29909,Sheldon,Yes. And make her wear the black wig. Good luck.
29910,Sheldon,Comments from our Behind the Flags retrospective. Get this people are calling it the longest one yet.
29911,Penny,Oh God no no. Just please tell me what to do about it.
29912,Leonard,No.
29913,Howard,It’s a potty. What do you call it?
29914,Sheldon,Oh yes. I just discovered I don’t have enough room on my hard drive for a Linux partition so you and I are going to perform a full backup reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems.
29915,Leonard,I’m very happy for you.
29916,Leonard,Sure.
29917,Sheldon,That’s wrong.
29918,Sheldon,Leonard you may be right. It appears that Penny secretly wants you in her life in a very intimate and carnal fashion.
29919,Penny,Well she is taking me to an Indigo Girls concert so hold that thought.
29920,Sheldon,Ha-ha you have to go to a wedding.
29921,Leonard,Do you know what a disaster this is?
29922,Howard,Don’t come to the hospital. We’re headed home.
29923,Sheldon,It would? Fun? Okay three weeks ago you bought crunchy peanut butter now you want the girls to play D&D? Do you have a drug problem?
29924,Howard,I like comic books.
29925,Raj,So does enjoying a meal at a well-lit restaurant but here we are.
29926,Sheldon,Once again defeated by your own prurient interests.
29927,Sheldon,No. Despite what the name suggests the civet cat is not a true cat. Now I’m done.
29928,Penny,I’m sorry. You sent more than one letter about that?
29929,Penny,You know just for fun let’s say I’m not.
29931,Raj,You can dance to this. Um uh uh Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning the other plays with bones.
29932,Howard,No I’m behind on my wiki-reading I’m kind of on a John Grisham kick right now.
29933,Penny,What?
29934,Leonard,We’re not living together.
29935,Leonard,Relax it’s five o’clock. The movie doesn’t start till midnight.
29936,Penny,Well choose.
29937,Raj,Chickens can’t climb trees
29938,Sheldon,Well you really want to dot the I’s and cross the T’s don’t you?
29939,Penny,No Leonard this is my thing.
29940,Penny,Oh come on he’s a grown man he can take care of himself.
29941,Sheldon,Did you have a nice time?
29942,Leonard,Really?
29943,Leonard,Really?
29944,Howard,Now three times fast?
29945,Sheldon,And that’s why we wear hard hats.
29946,Leonard,Hmm.
29947,Leonard,Yeah we’re not like Haroun and Tanweer!
29948,Howard,No this is creepy.
29950,Howard,Fine. I’ll have a chocolate martini.
29951,Sheldon,Oh is it? We’re conversing. Checkmate.
29952,Sheldon,Paradigm-shifting news gentlemen. 
29953,Raj,Okay who gets the extra dumpling?
29954,Sheldon,Not height vision athleticism or ability to digest dairy products.
29955,Sheldon,Don’t try to change the subject. This is about a parking space. It has nothing to do with cars.
29956,Penny,Hey you ever imagine what that would be like? Not being born?
29957,Penny,Leonard this is nice. I’m so glad we did this.
29958,Penny,Oh God. Stop. I don’t want you to read something you think’ll just butter me up. I want to hear the most recent thing you wrote.
29959,Leonard,What happened?
29960,Leonard,I tried in the seventh grade. I could never get used to them.
29961,Sheldon,Well first of all your lie was laughably transparent where mine is exquisitely convoluted. While you were sleeping I was weaving an un-unravelable web.
29962,Sheldon,Oh I know. We could be the first to plant a flag on Mars. We could be the first to watch Mars Attacks! on Mars. We could be the first to say good lord what on Mars are you talking about?
29963,Howard,Well uh there was a time when I had a thing for Penny and I thought she was into me too because she got drunk and naked and climbed into bed with me. But apparently I misread those signals.
29964,Raj,You’re right I am humiliated. Thanks for pointing it out. You’re such a jerk.
29965,Penny,Great. Not like regret at all.
29966,Raj,I do but for some reason Emily loves it and wants to watch it with me tomorrow so I thought if I start with you first then I could act cool about it with her.
29967,Sheldon,Yep.
29968,Howard,It’s okay. I don’t mind hearing about your sex life. It’s his that bugs me.
29969,Raj,I wasn’t joking.
29970,Sheldon,Who’s Nowitzki?
29971,Sheldon,Well?
29972,Raj,I’m not really a part of this so I’m just gonna dig in.
29973,Sheldon,I know our apartment’s small but I think we can make room.
29974,Penny,Yeah.
29975,Penny,Yeah okay neat but I really got to get to work so….
29976,Raj,No one was writing me back so I stopped checking my profile.
29977,Leonard,Did he pay you back?
29978,Howard,You coming?
29979,Leonard,It’s cute they’re having fun living together.
29980,Leonard,I’m sold you’re ahead of Bale.
29981,Penny,Do you have any idea what time it is?
29982,Leonard,This is great. It thank you it’s so much.
29983,Leonard,Of course.
29984,Leonard,Hell Hounds.
29985,Sheldon,Here you go.
29986,Sheldon,I don’t see anything in here a woman would want.
29987,Leonard,Mr. Nye hello. I’m sorry he got you involved in this nonsense.
29989,Sheldon,As your friend let’s hope it doesn’t come to that. Please sign.
29990,Raj,You’re you’re a good friend for trying to help but I’ve made my choice.
29991,Penny,Hi. There’s the little family!
29992,Penny,Do any of them work?
29993,Leonard,Hey we’re all having dinner tonight. Why don’t the two of you join us?
29994,Howard,Do you hear how homophobic you sound?
29995,Penny,I love you too.
29996,Sheldon,Rabbits do have a respiratory system that would support great size. And on a side note they are one of the few mammals whose scrotum is in front of the penis.
29997,Penny,I’m… I’m sorry. What does this have to do with me?
29998,Sheldon,Now only if you want to.
29999,Leonard,What about the girls?
30000,Sheldon,You sure I can’t get you that cup of tea?
30001,Raj,Excuse me hello? My parents are trying to marry me off to a total stranger what am I going to do?
30002,Sheldon, Amy.
30003,Sheldon,Ah memory impairment the free prize at the bottom of every vodka bottle.
30004,Sheldon,Oh you said it.
30005,Penny,Oh so now I need your permission? Would you have asked me before you quit your job?
30006,Penny,It’s just this vibe I got.
30007,Sheldon,Okay look how about this? Just give him my paper on the Higgs boson. If he sees the incredible breakthrough I’ve made he’ll reach out to me.
30008,Penny,Oh your yelling must have freaked him out again.
30009,Sheldon,Essentially yes.
30010,Raj,Why would it be too big a step?
30011,Penny,Who’s Adam West?
30012,Sheldon,I can’t believe I have to waste my time babysitting a bunch of grad students who probably think dark matter is what’s in their diapers.
30013,Howard,Why not?
30014,Sheldon,Amy what do you think?
30015,Howard,Okay and tree pose.
30016,Leonard,I’ll I’ll call for help.
30017,Raj,I just wanted to do something beautiful.
30018,Sheldon,Oh is it? Look at this. General Tso’s Chicken is no longer listed under specialties. It’s now under chicken.
30019,Howard,Just fine? Oh dude the fourth Harry Potter movie was just fine.
30020,Leonard,The problem is I want to be one of those guys.
30022,Sheldon,It’s all right.
30023,Sheldon,Hello. I’m Doctor Sheldon Cooper and welcome to Sheldon Cooper presents Fun with Flags the final episode flagtacular. I knew it was coming. Still scary. Now I’m sure you’re thinking the final episode? Who will stand between us and flag ignorance?
30024,Raj,Okay an eight is acceptable if she’s willing to bring another eight to the hot tub.
30025,Sheldon,Anyway if you could just give us our money back you can have your helium and we’ll be on our way.
30026,Sheldon,Thank you.
30027,Raj,Sheldon for God’s sakes don’t make me beg.
30028,Howard,Good point. And you are?
30029,Penny,Oh there’s a screening of Moulin Rouge I heard the crowd sings along and stuff.
30030,Raj,Of course.
30031,Sheldon,Last one.
30032,Penny,Hey here’s another possible topic of conversation. This is a big night for Sheldon. Right Sheldon?
30033,Leonard,Yeah well so was I.
30034,Howard,Uh so forgive me forgive me for being nosy but is is there a wedding ring under those pretty rubber gloves?
30035,Sheldon,Yes.
30037,Penny,Okay I’m sorry I don’t understand.
30038,Penny,Hey how are things going with your parents?
30040,Howard,You! Always bet on black.
30041,Sheldon,Hello.
30042,Penny,So who exactly does it want to kill?
30043,Sheldon,When are you going to talk to him?
30044,Sheldon,Dibs doesn’t apply in a bidding war.
30045,Leonard,Of course you do.
30046,Penny,Yeah get it girl.
30047,Sheldon,Oh if you want to get in on the pool you’re too late. All the squares have been purchased.
30048,Sheldon,Oh Amy. And you wonder why people think neuroscience is nothing but a goofy game for diaper babies. Tic-tac-toe can only end in win lose or draw none of which will deny me closure. Especially since I’m about to win.  B-But we didn’t finish.
30049,Leonard,Yes.
30050,Sheldon,A margarita? Where are we? What is happening?
30051,Howard,No.
30052,Leonard,Come on Sheldon. You can’t turn your back on physics and besides you have no idea what you’re doing with this stuff.
30053,Leonard,So a few things don’t go your way and your best decision is to ride the rails like a hobo?
30054,Raj,I think over time they started to resent each other and instead of talking about the things that bothered them they kept it bottled up and the hate just grew.
30055,Leonard,This is an Euler’s Disk. It’s a physics toy that demonstrates angular momentum potential energy and kinetic energy.
30056,Penny,Sorry they’re both married.
30057,Sheldon,No. But it’s a shame our society mocks the differently uvulated. Who was at the door?
30058,Leonard,Don’t look under that rock.  Raj you okay?
30059,Howard,Well it’s easy to find out. Just go into the crawlspace under the house and check.
30060,Penny,Oh. That’s so sweet of you.
30061,Penny,I didn’t know you could drink while you’re breastfeeding.
30062,Penny,How did you even get in you weirdo?
30063,Sheldon,That’s reserved for thoughts I don’t share with anyone.
30064,Sheldon,Fine. Candy bars. Now do you enjoy a fun size? I know you do.
30065,Howard,I’m taking a stroll and I’m sporting wood.
30066,Penny,You know just once I would like to go out with someone who is nice and honest and who actually cares about me.
30068,Sheldon,No it’s the accepted convention. How was your day?
30069,Leonard,Oh shut up.
30070,Howard,For God’s sake just drive in the knife why don’t you.
30071,Howard,Two words 3-D printer. Wait maybe it’s three words. No hang on. Okay one word a letter and a number and maybe a hyphen. 3-D printer.
30072,Penny,Three words Doctor Who convention.
30073,Leonard,I know. Last time I came on too strong. Can we talk in private?
30075,Penny,Obviously I have some commitment issues.
30076,Sheldon,Then I’ll settle for an aneurysm.
30077,Penny,Okay whatever. It’s not like I’m running up and down the streets just buying myself berets. I bought one like a month ago and it was back-ordered look it finally arrived all right?
30078,Penny,Well look we just wanted to apologize for not bringing you with us the other day.
30079,Penny,No it’s the movie your wife doesn’t want you to see.
30080,Sheldon,Gentlemen I am ready to work. To quote The Martian let’s science the faeces out of this. That’s The Martian the book and The Martian the movie not Marvin the Martian. Although to quote Marvin the Martian I claim this planet in the name of Mars.
30081,Sheldon,What about Nebraska?
30082,Sheldon,They took my battle ostrich.
30083,Raj,He is kind of a weirdo. Maybe he’s got Leonard Nimoy chained up in there. Or Bill Gates. Or Stephen Hawking.
30084,Leonard,Bye.
30085,Sheldon,You didn’t even let me finish.
30086,Leonard,Hope you’re hungry.
30087,Sheldon,Relax we’re not under attack right now.
30088,Penny,Okay if you support me what was with that phone call?
30089,Penny,Uh not everything just like the jail and drugs part.
30090,Sheldon,Gentlemen. Uh no doubt you heard about my little breakthrough. Now if your plan is to hoist me on your shoulders and carry me around the cafeteria please refrain. I don’t care for heights motion sickness or the thought of your necks touching my buttocks.
30091,Leonard,You make a lot of sense. I like this table and I’m getting it.
30092,Howard,Okay I’ll start heating some of this stuff up.
30093,Leonard,I’m so sorry. I know it’s a sensitive subject but can you reconsider that part in the movie?
30094,Sheldon,I never did get that chicken noodle did I?
30095,Sheldon,We had dinner last night. She made me spaghetti with little hot dogs cut up in it. Well little hot dog. I gave up the other five hot dogs to a real dog. A real big dog. A hell hound. Tangential to the primary story. How about I circle back to it?
30096,Penny,Ugh that sounds like a lot of work.
30097,Sheldon,What are we having?
30098,Leonard,No no that’s the past. I’m really more of a right now kind of guy. You know living in the moment. Although I do have to live a little in the future ’cause well that’s my job. Of course my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards but those stories often take place in the future. In conclusion no it doesn’t bother me.
30099,Sheldon,What kind of world do we live in where a man would take another man’s battle ostrich?
30100,Raj,Raj.
30101,Howard,A-All right um how about this. When when Winnie the Pooh got his head stuck in the honey tree his friends all grabbed onto him and pulled and pulled.
30102,Leonard,No hurry.
30103,Sheldon,I can’t believe we wasted all that time on our Hulk costumes.
30104,Leonard,Let’s see. What’s young and fun? Uh we could go dancing.
30106,Sheldon,I’m sorry. 16?
30107,Penny,You’re not gonna let this go are you?
30108,Penny,I’m sorry is the fact that my life’s falling apart interfering with your board game?
30109,Penny,I know. I heard.
30110,Penny,You’re kidding.
30111,Sheldon,You know the joke’s on him. Without the certificate of authenticity that bat’leth is worthless.
30112,Leonard,Instead of dwelling on the negative think about this. Your girlfriend was given an amazing opportunity which gives you an opportunity to show her that you’re a loving and supportive boyfriend.
30113,Sheldon,I thought that subject had run its course so I changed it. It’s called reading the room Amy.
30114,Penny,Okay look we don’t need to rush into anything. All right? Maybe instead of Leonard moving in with me we just leave things the way they are and sometimes we’ll sleep over there and sometimes we’ll sleep over here.
30115,Sheldon,Wooh I’m all sweaty anybody want to log on to second life and go swimming I just built a virtual pool.
30116,Sheldon,Defcon 5? Well there’s no need to rush.
30117,Sheldon,Good morning.
30118,Leonard,Okay listen. You don’t have to wear the wig. At this party we’re gonna win first prize just by showing up with a girl.
30119,Penny,Sheldon I’m working.
30120,Howard,I call it the Mario and Luigi but whatever. Hey how’s Sheldon doing?
30121,Howard,No come on please don’t leave.
30122,Raj,If you want you can find out right now.
30123,Sheldon,How else are you gonna study for the tests?
30124,Leonard,This conference is kind of a big thing. The keynote address is being delivered by George Smoot.
30125,Raj,Yeah s-so it’s like Kooper with a K?
30126,Penny,Wait why me? Wh-Why can’t your girlfriend be Wonder Woman?
30127,Leonard,I understand it Sheldon.
30128,Sheldon,Well is that really necessary. If you need money you can always sell blood. And semen.
30129,Sheldon,Is qochbe’ spelled with a ?
30130,Howard,So uh what were you thinking? Combine their names?
30131,Howard,Yup.
30132,Raj,Damn.
30133,Leonard,I’m in. Let’s do it.
30134,Penny,You will.
30135,Howard,So while I’m waiting for this mysterious perfect match who may or may not exist I’m supposed to just be alone.
30136,Penny,Well for starters at some point that face starts talking.
30137,Penny,No it’s usually over a weekend and trust me you do not feel good after it.
30138,Howard,He’s got a point.
30139,Leonard,We’ve got to be missing something. Let’s start again. The movie is playing here at 720 here at 740 here at 810 and here at 845.
30140,Penny,Not done. By the time I finally got to work they’d given my shift away. Yeah that’s right I’ve lost an entire day’s pay thanks to this… this…
30141,Sheldon,Oh you are going to love her. She is the kindest sweetest woman you’ll ever meet. Unless you’re a gopher digging up her vegetable garden. In that case you can expect to have your head bashed in with a shovel.
30142,Howard,Dude if I was wearing a bra I’d throw it at your head right now.
30143,Penny,This doesn’t make any sense. I mean I I thought I did a a really good job I… Excuse me.
30144,Penny,Oh I meant beer pong.
30145,Sheldon,Yes but I assumed I would have been dead hundreds of years and that there would be an asterisk by his name because he would be a cyborg.
30147,Sheldon,Oh. You got even smaller. I love it. Uh Meemaw this is Leonard. Leonard this is my Meemaw.
30148,Leonard,Thank you Sheldon you’re a good friend.
30149,Leonard,Right there right there Oh God that’s it.
30150,Leonard,Go to sleep.
30151,Howard,Well that’s what the bullies at Bruce Lee’s high school thought. And then bam. Karate.
30152,Sheldon,Where’s my notebook? My notebook’s gone. Oh no.
30153,Howard,Don’t be silly. Just tell him.
30154,Leonard,It’s not difficult for me. I’m having fun.
30155,Howard,Hear hear.
30156,Penny,Oh.
30157,Penny,Okay.
30158,Penny,No sorry.
30159,Sheldon,Oh come on. It’s just a simple favour. Now when’s the last time I asked you to do something for me?
30160,Leonard,Okay two friends each.
30161,Howard,Well hey you’re my dear friends. You’ll get a Christmas card for a couple of years and then you’re dead to me.
30162,Raj,What are you going to tell your mother?
30163,Raj,What about the multiplex here? The seats are terrific.
30164,Sheldon,Well I would prefer if people told me exactly what is on their mind.
30165,Raj,Where have you been?
30166,Leonard,Aw. Am I like the dryer sheets of your heart?
30167,Leonard,Hmm. I can honestly say Penny.
30168,Penny,Wow you really are a genius.
30169,Penny,Now honey it’s okay.You don’t have to get me anything in return.
30170,Raj,Not much but he seemed to be in a pretty good place.
30171,Penny,You’re not working late. Why did you lie to me?
30172,Sheldon,Uh can you repeat that? You’re breaking up.
30173,Leonard,And?
30174,Raj,Yup.
30175,Howard,Okay uh let’s try it again. Uh but this time pretend the girl you want to meet doesn’t want to hurt you.
30176,Penny,Gosh I worked my ass off today. This is exactly what I needed.
30177,Sheldon,Jab mein aat saal ka tha maine seekha tha. 
30178,Sheldon,And you’re not allowed to be sarcastic or snide to me while I’m doing so.
30179,Leonard,Sheldon you are not sick. This is but you are not.
30180,Sheldon,Oh. Very well. Re-initiating calibration sequence. One two three four five six seven eight nine ten… eleven. It’s a good thing I didn’t send that letter.
30181,Raj,What’s happening to us? We’re falling apart.
30182,Howard,Yeah of course.
30183,Leonard,Is that what you want?
30184,Leonard,Well what is it?
30185,Penny,You know where I come from someone comes into your house at night you shoot okay? And you don’t shoot to wound. I mean alright my sister shot her husband but it was an accident they were drunk. What was I saying?
30186,Penny,Are you sure?
30187,Howard,You know did he say things like youse guys or listen here see?
30188,Leonard,No. I’m having a moral crisis.
30189,Penny,What’s Mrs. Riley’s chicken?
30190,Howard,Stuart?
30191,Raj,No no no no! That rate is much too low for what we’d expect from this collision. Do you understand that we’re talking about dark matter colliding in outer space?
30192,Penny,Oh does that come up much on the space station?
30193,Leonard,You want to decorate it tonight?
30194,Penny,All right let me try this again. Where’s Leonard?
30195,Raj,I think the next time I have to speak to a call centre in India I’m going to try using an American accent.
30196,Sheldon,Well today we tried masturbating for money.
30197,Penny,Okay.
30198,Sheldon,I’m attempting to view my work as a fleeting peripheral image so as to engage the superior colliculus of my brain.
30199,Raj,Go. 
30200,Leonard,Well I don’t know how to do that.
30201,Raj,With a woman you were chasing through a park? That’s not a shot that’s a felony. What’s worse it cost me my prized Patang fighting kite. Sheldon I don’t suppose there’s any chance you could give me my kite back?
30202,Raj,Why do you bounce with your hands in the air like that?
30203,Leonard,Relatively modern. Why what are you wearing?
30204,Sheldon,Yes.
30205,Penny,Okay. Open your eyes and see your new room.
30206,Leonard,Wait. What are you talking about?
30207,Raj,Oh please?
30208,Penny,Hi. You know you probably don’t want to go in there.
30209,Sheldon,Nuts to that. What else you got?
30210,Howard,Hey look there’s Rothman’s empty office. Sad.
30211,Sheldon,What?
30212,Leonard,All right Sheldon if you need me to take you to the dentist I will take you to the dentist.
30213,Penny,Okay. Um. Well I already talked to Raj but I wanted to apologize to the rest of you for you know everything.
30214,Howard,Thank you. How come you didn’t call me this morning?
30216,Leonard,So does that mean we get to do stuff like talk about cool shows or get dressed up in matching costumes and go to Comic-Con?
30217,Leonard,Please forgive me. I should have told you about Alex.
30218,Penny,Here Leonard ten eleven twelve uh fourteen dollars.
30219,Howard,He lives with Leonard.
30220,Penny,All right. What do you think is happening?
30221,Leonard,Sheldon you got a minute?
30222,Raj,Yeah. He’s 24. He’s a deejay. He brews his own beer. He’s got awesome tattoos. Dude he’s got a hot girlfriend too.
30223,Leonard,Would you please help us make a relationship agreement? But one that’s tailored to us okay we don’t need a bathroom schedule.
30224,Raj,I learned that for free from a cat poster but good for you.
30225,Howard,I say okey-dokey.
30226,Sheldon,Yeah well it’s just some quantum mechanics with a little string theory doodling around the edges. That part there that’s just a joke it’s a spoof of the Bourne-Oppenheimer approximation.
30227,Sheldon,Okay literal goose bumps. Look.
30228,Leonard,Okay look Sheldon the Colonel wants us to make the guidance system smaller and we can’t do it without you.
30229,Penny,Yeah you grabbed your penis and wouldn’t let go. Your mother told me.
30230,Penny,Raj cool it he’s gonna make us hair diamonds.
30231,Sheldon,This must be how you practice law in Boca Raton by saying things you don’t mean and meaning things you don’t say.
30232,Leonard,I know. And those specials they change every day.
30233,Penny,It was a gift. Thank you for being the emotional one in this relationship.
30234,Raj,Have you guys seen this feature that lets you talk to Siri without pressing any buttons?
30235,Howard,Actually in India the names of constellations are different. Where you have the Big Dipper we have the Big Curry Pot.
30236,Raj,I stopped on the way to work. Hey do you want to peel the plastic off with me?
30237,Howard,Next time take your own advice.
30238,Howard,You don’t want to do that. Refreezing not only removes moisture but it creates ice crystals in the fibres of the meat that can compromise its taste and texture. What? I saw a teachable moment. I dropped some culinary science.
30239,Sheldon,Apparently any man is welcome in this house. Why not you? I thought you were waiting in the car.
30240,Leonard,Uh that is an integrated ion trap and time-of-flight mass spectrometer.
30241,Raj,Oh not really just hang out.
30242,Sheldon,I had no choice. I couldn’t sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom was our living room and just outside our living room was that hallway and immediately adjacent to that hallway was… this.
30243,Leonard,I’ve got a better idea.
30244,Penny,I’m fine.
30245,Leonard,He keeps emergency Purell in the car.
30246,Leonard,How is it my fault?
30247,Sheldon,Yes and she’s not taking my feelings into account at all. Maybe it’s time I teach her a lesson.
30248,Sheldon,Thank you for taking time out of your very busy schedule to enlighten these young women.
30249,Howard,Oh screw Princess Punchali.
30250,Sheldon,No but last year at Magic Mountain he got such a bad sunburn we had to cut him out of it.
30251,Howard,It’s it’s not working dude.
30252,Penny,Yeah well I’m sick too.
30253,Penny,Oh no no it’s okay. You might slip on a banana peel and get me pregnant.
30254,Howard,Okay that sounds like us.
30255,Raj,I haven’t bonded with it.
30256,Sheldon,Oh don’t be offended. You know of the four of us you have the most veal-like consistency.
30257,Raj,I’m so glad we could work this all out.
30258,Sheldon,Hello.
30259,Raj,Really? I don’t know where she’d get an idea like that. You know Mummy and her crazy imagination I’m so lucky I take after you.
30260,Penny,Oh.
30261,Penny,Nah.
30262,Sheldon,Remember seven o’clock.
30263,Howard,Hey.
30264,Howard,Me too.
30265,Raj,Okay if no-one else will say it I will. We really suck at paintball.
30266,Howard,Well you can’t stay with me I have a teeny tiny apartment.
30267,Sheldon,A juvenile amalgamation of our names. Sheldon and Amy  Shamy.
30268,Penny,How early are we?
30269,Penny,Yeah. Do you think living with Amy has somehow stirred up Sheldon’s sexual appetite?
30270,Howard,What did you do? Did you change the contrast or brightness settings on the television?
30271,Sheldon,All right we’re going to be designing an experiment to look for the annihilation spectrum resulting from dark matter collisions in space.
30272,Howard,Yeah knock it off Howard.
30273,Raj,Good morning everybody. I picked up coffee while I was out. Bernadette here’s your soy peppermint mocha.
30274,Leonard,That’s right. I’m her change daddy.
30275,Sheldon,Remember when I said if you went through with your surgery there was a one-in-700000 chance of dying?
30276,Leonard,That’s not ridiculous. Good night.
30277,Sheldon,Wait I need help getting down.
30278,Sheldon,Oh dear. Two suns and no sunscreen.
30279,Howard,Okay the final image is coming in. And the object we discovered is…
30280,Penny,You okay?
30281,Sheldon,Wait no no. No. The word is Polish. See look. Polish sausage. And the the model of the solar system developed by Nicolaus Copernicus a Polish astronomer. And then finally if that wasn’t enough which it should have been this is Madame Curie killing herself by discovering radium who although she was a naturalized French citizen was Polish by birth.
30282,Penny,You do make a cute elf.
30283,Penny,Just shut up Glen. Come on let’s get out of here.
30284,Raj,Oh. If I had one it would be Brown Dynamite.
30285,Penny,So you’re probably wondering what that was all about.
30286,Penny,Well why wouldn’t this be a safe place? I mean he’s surrounded by his wife and one of his best friends.
30287,Raj,Yeah. Come on I’ll give you a ride.
30288,Penny,Okay you guys had sex one whole time. Nothing can put out a fire like that.
30289,Penny,And you know about that stuff?
30290,Penny,Oh I love me some Leo.
30291,Sheldon,You flatter me sir.
30292,Howard,You are not my superior.
30293,Penny,Sheldon.
30294,Howard,Uh would you like to come in?
30295,Leonard,Please be good. Please be good. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. She writes like she cooks.
30296,Howard,This is tough but I’m going to say it’s the guy who shows me YouTube videos of people getting hit in the nuts.
30297,Penny,Eh his giant head did most of the work.
30298,Sheldon,I think a more amusing violation of Raj’s trust is when Howard convinced him that foreigners give presents to Americans on Thanksgiving.
30299,Leonard,Yeah sure.
30300,Raj,Maybe we should see how he’s doing.
30301,Leonard,Oh no.
30302,Sheldon,I will always have the dent to remember it by.
30303,Raj,Yeah great. Um I’ll put food in her top half you deal with whatever comes out the bottom.
30304,Leonard,Excuse me I’m sitting here.
30305,Leonard,Schooled!
30306,Sheldon,Oh well then by all means carry on. I wouldn’t want to impede your progress.
30307,Leonard,Hi my name’s Leonard.
30308,Leonard,We’re not living together.
30309,Sheldon,That was fun. It was like Mario Kart.
30310,Sheldon,Well…
30311,Sheldon,Here’s the problem with teleportation.
30312,Raj,Good timing. Dinner’s almost ready.
30313,Leonard,Do you understand that Stephanie’s not here to treat your imaginary ailments?
30314,Penny,Well he’s my friend. It’s what you do. 
30315,Leonard,Because we just spent our allowance on comic books.
30316,Howard,I would have included the others but you know exactly what would’ve happened. They would’ve taken over the project and bossed us around.
30317,Raj,Sheldon tells it better.
30318,Penny,Oh hell with Nebraska. I’m gonna be a star!
30319,Sheldon,Oh we got a sword and a plant our apartment’s really shaping up.
30320,Leonard,No no I’m good. If my P.E. teachers had told me this is what I was training for I would have tried a lot harder.
30321,Howard,That’s a Hanukkah present you’re regretting huh?
30322,Sheldon,Thank you that’s very gracious.     Gentlemen.
30323,Sheldon,I miss you too. Hey this is good timing. Remember that Dr. Nowitzki I told you about? She’s right here.
30324,Leonard,Some people might say it was romantic.
30325,Sheldon,Why not? It seems like you’re improvising your entire curriculum.
30326,Leonard,What am I supposed to do pretend I believe something I don’t whenever I’m with Penny?
30327,Sheldon,Why would I touch her she’s covered with airplane germs.
30328,Leonard,Yeah.
30329,Raj,Well you could be very frugal. I’m getting a little tired of everybody’s sarcasm.
30330,Sheldon,Oh boy.
30331,Sheldon,You know when my grandfather died and Meemaw was alone my mom arranged for her to visit a centre three times a week where she could socialize with other lonely people. It’s very nice. They discuss current events play bridge get a hot meal.
30332,Penny,Hi Leo how are you feeling?
30333,Sheldon,Are you sure? Sometimes when my brain really gets moving it makes noise.
30334,Sheldon,A superb choice.
30335,Penny,Oh Leonard was telling me about dark matter but I didn’t really understand it.
30336,Leonard,You’re in a good mood.
30337,Sheldon,It’s a small price to pay.
30338,Howard,We can drive there.
30339,Sheldon,Are you trying to scare me? ‘Cause you’re succeeding.
30340,Howard,And I have to be honest I thought it was disturbing and weird and it made me wonder what it says about someone who enjoys it.
30341,Leonard,Absolutely.
30342,Howard,Are you kidding? He made me sign a waiver participate in an emergency fire drill and take a refresher course in CPR. Thank God he had a dummy.
30343,Penny,You think we’ll have time to visit your mom over there?
30344,Leonard,You know digital alcohol is never a solution. What’s going on?
30345,Sheldon,Oh it’s quite straightforward actually. It describes a new model of the universe that conceptualizes it as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.
30346,Sheldon,Please. Why would Leonard come home early and waste his time kissing Penny when he could be hanging out with his best buddy? Yeah that’s it. I’m catching her in the act. 
30347,Leonard,No.
30348,Leonard,Is there a history of heart disease in your family?
30349,Leonard,Hang on. When is my pawn allowed to use the golf cart?
30350,Raj,Amen to that. Sometimes I pour a little chardonnay into my dog’s water bowl.
30351,Penny,What?
30352,Penny,Hi. You guys have a minute?
30353,Penny,I don’t get it.
30354,Leonard,Thank you. I appreciate that.
30355,Leonard,Yes you can.
30356,Sheldon,Yes. Actually I’m glad you’re here. I’m working on the Star Wars Day schedule. Now I have a window built in after Phantom Menace for complaining but I’m worried an hour won’t be enough time.
30357,Leonard,This is exciting.
30358,Howard,Really? I don’t know where she’d get an idea like that. You know Mummy and her crazy imagination I’m so lucky I take after you.
30359,Howard,Do you know any mining songs?
30360,Penny,I just can’t believe you don’t trust me.
30361,Penny,I know I know.
30362,Leonard,Can you give us a minute?
30363,Sheldon,Oh great! now I have to start all over again. 
30364,Penny,I guess I could probably try a little harder.
30365,Leonard,Well what do you think.
30366,Sheldon,Why would we want to do that? It’s called the comfort zone for a reason.
30367,Raj,Well no offence but I didn’t go to art school. I have a PhD in astrophysics.
30368,Raj,I don’t understand. Why is it bad that you have to teach?
30369,Sheldon,Oh not just something no. It’s from the heart it’s holiday-themed and I swallowed the gift receipt so you cannot return it.
30370,Leonard,Sorry. My apologies to the gay community of East Rutherford New Jersey.
30371,Raj,I can never find the tiller. I got a book; it didn’t help.
30372,Leonard,Thanks.
30373,Penny,Missy?
30374,Penny,Wow.
30375,Sheldon,Fine.  I don’t think I can go much longer.
30376,Sheldon,I suggest we treat our relationship as if it were a crashed computer and restore it to the last point we both agree it worked.
30377,Leonard,Don’t you think we should tell him you’re not interested?
30378,Raj,Whoo-hoo!
30379,Penny,Alright come on even you have to admit that’s jibber-jabber.
30380,Penny,No you did better than that you helped me see it on my own.
30381,Raj,Oh my God oh my God oh my God.
30382,Howard,So uh what are you guys talking about?
30383,Sheldon,Was the starfish wearing boxer shorts? Because you might have been watching Nickelodeon.
30384,Leonard,Okay who’s ready for some science? Me too. Okay I am Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. I am here with my friends Dr. Cooper and real-life astronaut Howard Wolowitz and we are going to show you girls how cool a job in science can be. How cool you ask? Well how about negative 273 degrees ’cause that’s the temperature at which entropy reaches its minimum value. Did I just learn something new and have fun doing it? What? All right. So now let’s bring out theoretical physicist Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
30385,Penny,Uh sweetie you do realize Thursday is Amy’s birthday.
30386,Sheldon,No and also I don’t want to disappoint you. I you know come on it’s your birthday. I can soldier through this.
30387,Penny,What do you mean new roommate? What happened to Leonard?
30388,Sheldon,Yes but what does it stand for?
30389,Leonard,Uh-huh.
30390,Leonard,What? This road trip just got crazy.
30391,Sheldon,I’m sorry. I don’t work here.
30392,Penny,What are you saying? That I’m using my body to get dinner? That I’m some kind of Chinese food prostitute?
30394,Leonard,I hate to say it but she did kind of betray you.
30395,Leonard,It’s not bold it’s a mistake. I didn’t change my status.
30396,Sheldon,Oh no. A plaque? Nobody wants to see this.
30397,Raj,Is there another Penny here? I had such plans. I had dreams. I was going to be the Indira Gandhi of particle astro-physics. But with a penis of course.
30398,Leonard,You don’t.
30399,Howard,It’s not about that.
30400,Leonard,To do what?
30401,Sheldon,What’s going on?
30402,Sheldon,But then each of those people let someone cut?
30403,Sheldon,Maybe it’s just something minor. Ooh good news the light just went out.
30404,Sheldon,Hello Stuart.
30405,Leonard,I guess technically that was my fault.  I’m not leaving here without Penny’s money.
30406,Penny,Don’t patronise me just get the sword.
30407,Sheldon,It means come in. It’s taking forever to load the new operating system on my computer. I disinfected the kitchen and the bathroom and now I thought I’d learn Finnish.
30408,Penny,What are you guys talking about?
30409,Raj,What about Leslie Winkle.
30410,Penny,Oh cool.
30411,Penny,No no I’ve a bronze dagger.
30412,Leonard,That doesn’t matter to me at all.
30413,Sheldon,I couldn’t poop this morning.
30414,Leonard,Sheldon this interview is supposed to be about me.
30415,Leonard,Oh. Well good for you.
30416,Leonard,All right you brought this on yourself. Sheldon get him.
30417,Sheldon,Go north. You can’t go that way. Go west. A troll blocks your passage. Okay fasten your seatbelts kill troll. With what? With sword.  You don’t have the sword. Good golly it’s as if it’s actually happening to me.
30418,Raj,That’s cruel. You know it goes straight to my hips.
30419,Penny,Yeah it does and here we are.
30420,Leonard,It’s relatively new. I just know that I’m not gonna spend time with someone I don’t like simply to have a girlfriend. I’m okay on my own.
30421,Sheldon,Luminescence spell.
30422,Penny,Ooh what are you gonna get?
30423,Penny,Did you say it out loud with words?
30424,Howard,Sorry. Sorry.
30425,Sheldon,I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace.
30426,Penny,No you already threw up once. Go put on your PJs and brush your teeth.
30427,Leonard,Double guacamole?
30428,Penny,I’m sorry I didn’t have a camera.
30429,Leonard,Yeah! Dodgers are baseball right?
30430,Leonard,What does she want from me now?  What’s up?
30431,Penny,What?
30432,Raj,You’re right. It should be a cuddly Asian boy. Like me.
30433,Sheldon,Oh look Saturn 3 is on.
30434,Raj,Then why do you watch these things?
30435,Sheldon,Really. Talk to me about that pocket watch.
30436,Raj,But you finished your experiment a week ago.
30437,Penny,I guess my big problem is I never saw Leonard as the kind of guy who would do something like this.
30438,Sheldon,Why? I really don’t understand what’s happening here.
30439,Penny,Yeah it’s crazy but it totally works. Look we made this Penny Blossom in under three minutes.
30440,Sheldon,Thank you.
30441,Sheldon,Let’s try just walking out.
30442,Leonard,Aw.
30443,Howard,You know it’s been more than a year since I’ve even kissed a girl?
30444,Raj,We believe cows are gods.
30445,Penny,Please can I do it with him? Please?
30446,Sheldon,That criticism will come later in your report card.
30447,Leonard,Fine go for a little walk.
30448,Raj,It streams HD video straight to your phone while it’s flying.
30449,Sheldon,You’d think a winner could make a decent cup of cocoa.
30450,Sheldon,He’s not a barber he’s the nephew. He’s an example of the kind of nepotism that runs rampant in the barbering industry. Besides Mr. D’Onofrio knows exactly how I like my hair done because he has all my haircut records from my barber in Texas.
30451,Howard,I got you a talking Thomas the Tank Engine for Thanksgiving.
30452,Penny,Just a couple of minutes. You’ve really never done this before?
30453,Sheldon,Well then why don’t you wear the rubber gloves I bought for you to do the dishes?
30454,Leonard,I know you’ll try. So should we talk about setting a date?
30455,Sheldon,So if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it and either slit is observed it will not go through both slits. If it’s unobserved it will however if it’s observed after it’s left the plane but before it hits its target it will not have gone through both slits.
30456,Sheldon,The Dark Knight has your back. He’s scared but he has your back.
30457,Penny,Yes dinner’s here and I’m having some. I’m having takeout food.
30458,Leonard,And while you’re at it I know that at this age your hormones are raging but just because all your friends are having sex doesn’t mean you have to.
30459,Sheldon,It is true that many of my heroes have taken students under their wings. Feynman Einstein Professor X. Humorously in the case of Professor X some of his students actually had wings. That’s rich. I’ll use that one to lighten the mood after my entire class fails the midterm.
30460,Leonard,Well it’s it’s possible at absolute zero but we would have to remove the temperature restrictions.
30461,Howard,Sorry doesn’t make up for the fact that I had to make chicken and rice with this vegan guy. Do you know what vegan chicken and rice is? Rice!
30462,Raj,Why do you have a parking spot? You don’t have a car. You don’t even drive.
30463,Sheldon,Doesn’t like games. That’s one.
30464,Leonard,Great.
30465,Leonard,Hey look who’s here.
30466,Raj,Holy crap.
30467,Sheldon,I didn’t care for her yelling. But now that I’m not going to hear it again I’m sad.
30468,Sheldon,Just like Schrodinger’s Cat your potential relationship with Leonard right now can be thought of as both good and bad. It is only by opening the box that you’ll find out which it is.
30469,Sheldon,Yes. From here on in I’ve decided to make all trivial decisions with a throw of the dice thus freeing up my mind to do what it does best enlighten and amaze. Page 14 item seven.
30470,Raj,It is. I feel alive.
30471,Sheldon,En garde Leonard. Prepare yourself for a rigorous touching.
30472,Sheldon,I am facing a great deal of work. And I do like things better when famous people also like them.
30473,Sheldon,Why?
30474,Howard,You got it.
30475,Leonard,So you’re going to spend hours and hours combing through all this stuff?
30476,Penny,So how do you feel? Nice and loose? Come to play? Got your game face on?  Are you ready?
30477,Sheldon,How’d that work out for you?
30478,Raj,Hey. Listen to this. Murder cannibalism and satanic rituals are just a few of the thousand plus horrors that await.
30479,Sheldon,Oh yes. Yeah and a fat lot of good it did me. All she did was get mad at you.
30480,Howard,Ooh ooh! Do our babies will be smart and beautiful. That one always makes me laugh.
30481,Penny,I don’t know. I was just trying something.
30482,Penny,Okay. Why?
30483,Sheldon,Really?
30484,Penny,I don’t know. Where were we looking up at the night sky?
30485,Penny,I don’t know. It’s fun while you’re doing it. And then after it’s mostly embarrassment self-loathing and regret.
30486,Sheldon,Well I suppose we could find a whole new place. You know and technically we don’t even have to stay in Pasadena. We could we could move to Altadena or a place that doesn’t even end in dena.
30487,Penny,This is all about listening and responding.
30488,Sheldon,No not the Wesley Crushers. The Wesley “Crushers.”
30489,Leonard,Really do tell.
30490,Penny,No no no no no. I’ve seen that movie. It’s called Iron Man.
30491,Howard,Yeah.
30492,Leonard,You don’t want that do you?
30493,Howard,Oh okay great. But if we’re really gonna do a double date then we have to go over some ground rules about Emily.
30494,Howard,He probably just goes to the bathroom.
30495,Sheldon,From an orang-u-tan in the primate lab.
30496,Sheldon,Do you know there are only eight consonants in the Hawaiian language.
30497,Sheldon,While my brother and sister are mouth-breathing idiots.
30498,Leonard,Yeah. Although when he was trying to figure out the tip I’m pretty sure I saw smoke coming out of his ears. You’re not really considering working for him are you?
30499,Sheldon,No no th-th-th-that can’t be right. I-I don’t make arithmetic mistakes.
30500,Raj,Well I’d like to point out I voted for orang-utan but you shouted me down. .
30501,Howard,You think he bites?
30502,Howard,Can you believe how pushy she is?
30503,Howard,You guys don’t have to go to the trouble. I’m back in the money now I can just buy another helicopter.
30505,Howard,You look you look really pretty tonight.
30507,Penny,None?
30508,Leonard,No it’s okay. We’re all adults trying to have an intelligent discussion. At least I am. Howard what do you think?
30509,Sheldon,Then to avoid Jewish hell?
30510,Sheldon,Oh please. I have ideas all day long. Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins are allowed to pet people. A new clothing size between medium and large called Marge. Snow White retold from the point of view of Sneezy. Why won’t Doc prescribe him something? We finally find out.
30511,Penny,Oh it’s no problem. It’s actually kind of nice. You reading me reading. We’re like an old married couple.
30512,Sheldon,Oh my. What an honour. Oh this is like being asked to ascend Mount Olympus and dine with the gods.
30513,Howard,It’s not just the kite thing. Every time we go some place you think you can just dump me whenever someone prettier comes along even though you don’t have a shot with them.
30514,Raj,Oh true. They’re practically giving them away. You know in exchange for money.
30515,Sheldon,Yes it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the Sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow effects your personality.
30516,Sheldon,I don’t know the first thing about women but I would not follow her.
30517,Leonard,Why?
30518,Penny,So?
30519,Sheldon,Do you know I’ve corresponded with Peter Higgs. Would you like to see some of his letters?
30520,Raj,Emily your face is like a precious dew-kissed flower.
30521,Raj,It’s interesting your father didn’t help around the house and Howard doesn’t help either so in a way Howard’s not only like your father but he’s also like the child that you’re afraid to have.
30522,Penny,Get out.
30523,Sheldon,No.
30524,Leonard,I don’t think I can go out with her tonight.
30525,Sheldon,Personally I find the notion of external rewards demeaning. I pursue science for the intrinsic joy of discovery.
30526,Leonard,I think the word you’re looking for is befuddled.
30527,Sheldon,Hold on. I see what’s wrong here. We did the propagation only to the occipital lobe not to the prefrontal cortex.
30528,Sheldon,Well have a lovely evening.
30529,Leonard,I still don’t understand why you bought that pill caddie. You’re a young man.
30530,Raj,That’s what I said when we moved it.
30531,Penny,What?
30532,Leonard,You went to the comic-book store by yourself?
30533,Raj,Oh pause it. That’s it. Confirmed. We now have the address of the top model house.
30534,Raj,Bert has a room for rent.
30535,Raj,Now that I know she doesn’t like me I’m kind of into her.
30536,Sheldon,Yeah Amy just one second. Meeting.
30537,Raj,I don’t know but I’d like to get lost in her Bermuda Triangle.
30538,Howard,No no not like Haroun and Tanweer.
30539,Leonard,Hey.
30540,Raj,What can I do? I can’t stop thinking about her.
30541,Howard,Ooh ooh. Did the pigeon on your windowsill have more babies?
30542,Penny,You know what I give up. He’s impossible.
30543,Leonard,I asked you over and over if you were okay. Why would you go through with the wedding if you weren’t?
30544,Penny,I don’t see how I could.
30545,Leonard,Sir uh if I may uh we’ve put a lot of thought and effort into this current prototype. It’s a really elegant solution and most importantly it works.
30546,Leonard,No of course not. Okay look instead of fighting why don’t we dim the lights um get naked and make a baby? I was trying to lighten the mood. It’s not easy. You try it.
30547,Raj,Thank you.
30548,Leonard,On the one hand if I say yes…
30549,Sheldon,Oh Doctor Hofstadter it’s so good to see you again.
30550,Sheldon,So Penny has a don’t knock on my door before eleven o’clock  or I punch you in the throat rule.
30551,Sheldon,She’s younger and far more attractive than he is. They’re copying you two.
30552,Leonard,Oh. Then what was last night about?
30553,Sheldon,Hello.
30554,Penny,All right. Well we’ll just pretend that you didn’t catch a cold watching Frozen.
30555,Penny,Oh that’s a nice offer.
30556,Leonard,Really? Do we do that?
30557,Sheldon,How do you deal with the success of your colleagues?
30558,Sheldon,Don’t you like Amy?
30559,Leonard,How about that? Einstein was wrong.
30560,Howard,You fooled me with that goat at the petting zoo. You will not fool me again.
30561,Leonard,As a cooling solution it’s pretty cool.
30562,Raj,I don’t need your help deciding when we need help!
30563,Leonard,Rough night Casey Jones?
30564,Sheldon,Don’t read those letters!
30565,Sheldon,I bet he’s someone from Babylon 5 we’re never going to guess.
30566,Howard,Hey! That’s my sister and my country you’re talking about. Leonard may have defiled one but I won’t have you talking smack about the other.
30567,Leonard,Okay. On the count of three I’ll shoot the fire extinguisher and get him airborne. Howard you wave the blanket and guide him towards the exit. Raj you hold open the curtain so he can fly out.
30569,Howard,No no it’s a very promising area. In a perfect world I’d spend several more years on it. But I just couldn’t pass up the opportunity to work with you on your tremendously exciting and not yet conclusively disproved hypothesis.
30570,Leonard,Give it a second. 
30571,Raj,I’m looking to make extra money and was wondering if you had any chores I could do.
30572,Leonard,Oh.
30573,Sheldon,Well? What do you think of New Comic Book Night? Magic huh?
30574,Raj,Is it Eddie Crispo?
30575,Raj,Uh heads up both of you are named Emily so we’ll call you red-headed Emily and you red-headed Emily Junior.
30576,Raj,So while I’m waiting for this mysterious perfect match who may or may not exist I’m supposed to just be alone.
30577,Sheldon,All right that’s it. Who Con you’re out.
30578,Sheldon,Why are you doing that?
30579,Raj,I can’t do anything right for you can I?
30580,Penny,What’s the matter?
30581,Leonard,Okay.
30582,Howard,Do you think I’m feminine?
30583,Leonard,Oh okay it’s not important. It can wait.
30584,Sheldon,You you dirty birdie. I-I thought about the things you said to me yesterday and I realized I’m deeply offended. Now be a dear and get me one of those complaint forms.
30585,Penny,So Amy I’ve been wondering are you and Sheldon going to be sharing a room?
30586,Sheldon,Oh then I’m out.
30587,Leonard,Sure you did.
30588,Leonard,Okay. Yet he cried when they changed the Raisin Bran box.
30589,Sheldon,You know I used to hate these hugs. Now they’re just extremely irritating.
30590,Penny,Yeah yeah me and Zack again.
30591,Sheldon,And may I point out it is the three of you who are obsessed with Stuart and Amy not me. I think you need to ask yourselves who’s really being ridiculous here. 
30592,Leonard,It’s gonna be hard to find something you’re both equally good at.
30593,Sheldon,I’ve been studying how to make people laugh. They say that comedy is tragedy plus time. Let’s tickle some ribs.
30594,Howard,Sorry.
30595,Leonard,Yeah great.
30596,Leonard,Excuse us for a second. Sheldon it’s okay he can do it. He’s a barber.
30597,Sheldon,I want oatmeal.
30598,Leonard,Please pester her. Please for me.
30599,Sheldon,Aquaman protecting your home since 2012.
30600,Penny,Come on but if you don’t stay awake we’ll never finish in time.
30601,Leonard,Maybe.
30602,Sheldon,It wasn’t a breakup. A breakup would imply that Amy was my girlfriend.
30603,Leonard,Aw.
30604,Sheldon,They are pants one wears over one’s regular pants when one sits on bus seats that other people have previously sat on. But perhaps from your lofty heights atop the corporate ladder you’ve lost touch with the struggles of the common man.
30605,Sheldon,I want her to feel at home. I also bought scented soaps pantyhose Midol calcium chews and what is apparently a yogurt specifically designed to regulate the female bowel.
30606,Raj,Probably because I didn’t read the instructions. No wrapper’s going to tell me what to do. Unless his name is Jay-Z.
30607,Howard,Don’t worry I’m a grown man. I have a thick skin.
30608,Sheldon,Oh nice to meet you Mr. Insightful.
30610,Penny,Okay well I’ll apologize for the first time but the other nine are on you.
30611,Leonard,Well what am I supposed to say stop having fun without me?
30612,Penny,37.
30613,Sheldon,And you’re worried that turkey neck is in your future. What now see now it says you’re mad. Make up your mind.
30614,Leonard,Not for long.
30615,Leonard,Making great time. Gonna be there pretty early.
30616,Howard,Yep I don’t see any way around it.
30617,Raj,No I was svelte as a gazelle. A gazelle blessed with a flair for storytelling.
30618,Raj,The cosmological physicist from Princeton?
30619,Raj,Well I trusted you and you let me down. The poor thing’s been shaking for hours.
30620,Howard,I’m just saying that after everything you’ve been through you get to look into each other’s eyes and say “I love you.” And that’s beautiful.
30621,Leonard,I think her weekend just opened up.
30622,Leonard,Yeah.
30623,Leonard,Wow you look amazing.
30624,Leonard,No but she might think I think it’s a date even though I don’t.
30625,Howard,What?
30626,Leonard,I’m not sure that I do. Um is that one thirty-six hour experience or is it thirty six hours spread out over say one… glorious summer.
30627,Raj,Really? I once saw him shopping at Ralph’s. He was buying tequila.
30628,Sheldon,Click it with me. One two three click.
30629,Sheldon,Mango caterpillar. What are you doing? You said you liked it!
30630,Sheldon,Well those are indicators that I’m farther along the evolutionary scale than the average human.
30631,Raj,I bought the first one it didn’t fall.
30632,Sheldon,Wait if Howard’s mother is coming then you should also steal marbles. Because she’s obese and hippos are obese and in the popular board game Hungry Hungry Hippos they eat marbles. Maybe I need to dumb these down for you.
30633,Sheldon,That’s why it’s guarded by snakes. Take some.
30634,Sheldon,This party is just going to suck.
30635,Leonard,He’s afraid the original owners will come back.
30636,Sheldon,Hmm. You know perhaps instead of confronting them we should see how far they’re willing to spin their tangled webs. Like that Spider-Man action figure that used to be on your desk.
30637,Leonard,Wow. That’s rough.
30638,Sheldon,June 30th 2004. Opening day of Spider-man 2 at the AMC Pasadena. They only had red icees no blue.
30639,Leonard,Sheldon everybody takes vacations.
30640,Penny,Oh great my rhinestones. Thank you.
30641,Penny,Really you want me to sing Soft Kitty to a computer monitor?
30642,Penny,And you guys aren’t going? I can’t believe you Raj is celebrating a tremendous accomplishment and you’re not even going to be there to support him?
30643,Leonard,I know what you’re doing. You’re trying to get attention so we’ll feel bad for you but it’s not happening.
30644,Penny,So how’s it going?
30645,Howard,My name is Little Orphan Annie. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
30646,Sheldon,Can we talk about this later.
30647,Howard,So what do you gals do?
30648,Sheldon,No thank you. And thank you ordinary person. Hey you want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes.
30649,Leonard,Oh good good.
30650,Sheldon,I’m not hitting on her.
30651,Leonard,Sheldon this is crazy.
30652,Penny,Yeah probably with a blow-up doll.
30653,Raj,Perfect for the night I’m having. Thank you.
30654,Sheldon,Leonard have you ever wondered why my little toes and lateral incisors are significantly smaller than the average for someone of my size?
30655,Sheldon,That’s what I said.
30656,Sheldon,It’s axiomatically atypical. Up until recently they did not know Alicia and had no encounters with her in a previous location. They never went upstairs to visit the former tenants so your characterization of their behaviour as typical Is demonstrably fallacious.
30657,Sheldon,Okay. What is your game?
30658,Howard,Come on Sheldon the world is filled with people doing things outside. Let’s go outside. Outside is good.
30659,Howard,Fine. You’re in Sheldon Square.
30660,Sheldon,Knock knock.
30661,Sheldon,Believe it or not Amy has embarked on a campaign to increase my feelings for her by making me happy.
30662,Raj,It was lovely meeting you best of luck in your future endeavours.
30663,Leonard,Okay when you say make the best of it.
30664,Howard,She’s kind of a mean drunk but what are you gonna do?
30665,Leonard,Me neither. Oh Sheldon seemed think that I would be upset about you hanging out with him. But I just want you to know it’s fine.
30666,Raj,What are negs?
30667,Penny,Can you please come get him?
30668,Penny,Okay back to the ring. Does Amy even know about this?
30669,Penny,What do you want Sheldon?
30670,Penny,Oh is it okay?
30671,Leonard,Well yeah no I met the huge ex-boyfriend and the smaller yet still larger than me ex-boyfriend. Were they here today?
30672,Sheldon,Don’t forget the mail you took accidentally on purpose so you’d have an excuse to talk to her.
30673,Leonard,Hey you’re early. The movie doesn’t start for an hour.
30674,Raj,Hold on. I’m talking to an orc under the bridge in Thunder Bluff who says if we pay him he’ll help us track down your things.
30675,Howard,Ooh Hallow-weenies! That’s a good one. They’ll pair nicely with my Draculoni and Cheese. How do I do it?
30676,Leonard,Yeah no problem.
30677,Sheldon,If I could keep my Gmail account I’d be okay with that.
30678,Howard,What? Don’t send me home. I can’t be alone right now.
30679,Leonard,My money’s on tuck and roll.
30680,Raj,Leonard help.
30681,Leonard,No.
30682,Leonard,I’m sorry too.
30683,Sheldon,That seems like a bit of an overreaction.
30684,Leonard,It’s getting pretty late how come you’re still up?
30685,Leonard,Mmm the nurse is a woman so he couldn’t talk to her. She had to bring him a Grover puppet so he could point at what hurt.
30687,Leonard,Hey.
30688,Penny,Well uh they shifted my schedule around at the restaurant so my hours are going to be a little different…
30689,Howard,Hello-lo-lo.
30690,Leonard,I’m really starting to think there’s a double standard here.
30691,Sheldon,Oh no no no. No I’ve too much to do.
30692,Sheldon,Who’s trying to seduce you? After a long day I always turn on smooth jazz and spray deer musk on my inner thighs.
30693,Penny,An hour? What? That’s crazy. We have a reservation.
30694,Leonard,Come on be serious.
30695,Penny,Yes you are. You always overthink things.
30696,Penny,Sheldon I am very very sorry.
30697,Leonard,Do you really think you should be eating that cake?
30698,Sheldon,No. But we have potatoes I could make you vodka. It’ll take two weeks.
30699,Sheldon,Oh dear lord.
30700,Penny,Wait what is wrong with you two? He was talking about television during their date night.
30701,Sheldon,Cut. Did you not see we are rolling?
30702,Leonard,Penny got it.
30703,Penny,I don’t know. It’s just he’s so passionate about so many different things. I just don’t get that way. Do you?
30704,Penny,Oh like Attack of the Clones. We are leaving right now.
30705,Sheldon,Yes. Kardashian.
30706,Howard,We can but for the record all chaps are assless.
30707,Penny,Here see if this one works.
30708,Leonard,They’ve been out there a while.
30709,Penny,Good luck. I threw out all my tall ones when I married Leonard.
30710,Leonard,That is unbelievable. Good for Bert.
30711,Sheldon,Don’t make this harder than it is Leonard.
30712,Leonard,Is it racist that I took you to an Indian restaurant?
30713,Leonard,Penny have you seen my good inhaler?
30714,Raj,We were badass back in the day.
30715,Penny,You know what that’s great. I love that.
30716,Penny,A sports metaphor?
30717,Sheldon,And I you. And yes that’s how you say that. Yeah so given our newfound intimacy I’d say we have some hard choices to make.
30718,Sheldon,Oh see? Now he gets it.
30719,Penny,No you’re right you shouldn’t talk to him. I will.
30720,Sheldon,And his last meal was a food pellet? You’re a monster.
30721,Raj,All right I’ve got your back.
30722,Leonard,I well I see her around. I like to keep my distance because her boyfriend is a pretty scary dude.
30723,Leonard,I still keep thinking about how an entire life can seemingly amount to nothing.
30724,Leonard,Yeah. He was kinda dreamy.
30725,Howard,Hey the jaw wants what it wants.
30726,Howard,Let me ask you a question. Do you believe you’re going to go to hell for eating sweet and sour pork?
30727,Penny,No sexy cop. Slutty cop only came with a skirt and two badges.
30728,Sheldon,Oh come on Leonard! This is obviously about Penny.
30729,Penny,Leonard I’m not gonna call up Kurt and ask him for money.
30730,Raj,You’re paying? Have you been selling your sperm again?
30731,Leonard,No I was gonna grab Raj and Howard and have a good time.
30732,Leonard,When are you going to stop making Cylon toast?
30733,Sheldon,Hey you taught me something. Who would have thought it?
30734,Sheldon,Well if you want romance then let’s have romance. Oh look there’s wine. Mmm. Grape juice that burns. Uh now let’s gaze into each other’s eyes hmm? You blinked. I win.
30735,Raj,Hey. Yeah. Hey sorry if last night was awkward.
30736,Howard,I will. Hey Bernadette?
30737,Leonard,I liked it better when you thought I wasn’t here.
30738,Sheldon,Excuse me. Before this evening goes any further we need to decide where everyone is going to sit.
30739,Leonard,Oh he was up late last night so I gave him an early dinner and put him to bed.
30740,Penny,Well for a while. Then he comes back.
30741,Howard,Have you guys seen this feature that lets you talk to Siri without pressing any buttons?
30742,Sheldon,Oh friggety-frak. Not this again.
30743,Leonard,Oh hi Penny!
30744,Sheldon,Leonard! If I’m going to get ahead of this thing I need to find out what’s growing in my throat.
30745,Raj,How is that both our names?
30746,Sheldon,That lecture was a waste of time. I made more accurate diagrams of the expansion of the early universe on the nursery wall with the contents of my diaper. 
30747,Penny,Do something.
30748,Leonard,Guava?
30749,Penny,Yeah sure.
30750,Sheldon,Outside? I just made cocoa.
30751,Sheldon,No we’re not. We’re standing in the hallway suffering through an awkward encounter.
30752,Sheldon,Actually you can’t have that one either. It’s too good. Sorry.
30753,Raj,Well if that’s the case Penny will have to get satellite TV and maybe once a week run a vacuum through this place.
30754,Raj,We’re scientists. We observe everything. Here go buy yourself a scone.
30755,Raj,Oh boy Sheldon’s going to freak out.
30756,Penny,So things started to turn around?
30757,Sheldon,What about comic-books?
30758,Penny,Your mom still here?
30759,Leonard,Double potion please.
30760,Leonard,Bam.
30761,Leonard,Hey Penny and I are gonna go shop for a dining room table. You want to come with us?
30762,Raj,I know you are. That’s why you just bought me a new iPad. And before you start I am not interested in you arranging a marriage for me.
30763,Leonard,Uh you have shoes you love but never wear. I have money I love but never spend. We’re kind of a cute couple that way. Again I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have kept it a secret.
30764,Raj,You’re kidding right?
30765,Penny,Okay just one question. What?
30766,Howard,That’s Howard’s cousin that he had sex with.
30767,Howard,And this is Leonard this is Penny.
30768,Raj,Sorry? That’s all you can say is sorry?
30769,Sheldon,Would you like to be?
30770,Leonard,No.
30771,Sheldon,In the words of Khan Noonien Singh in the immortal wrath of Khan he tasks me he tasks me and I shall have him.
30772,Sheldon,Statistically unlikely.
30774,Leonard,Terrific.
30775,Sheldon,Great. Now this may look like a Tic Tac but it is really a powerful medication specifically designed to cure your illness as well as freshen your breath.
30776,Leonard,Alright please don’t cheer me up anymore.
30777,Penny,Still don’t get it.
30778,Raj,Oh dude you are never getting a shiksa goddess.
30779,Raj,You okay? It’s you. You’re you’re next.
30780,Howard,Sheesh.
30782,Penny,Wait Leonard he’s hurting. Let him feel how he feels.
30783,Leonard,I’m very very sorry.
30784,Sheldon,No no we’re living together now everything’s equal. You know? I know that I have a tendency to be controlling so I would rather you choose.
30785,Penny,What are you doing?
30786,Sheldon,Well what if I spill tomato soup on my shirt and have to come home to change only to find there’s no water for an enzyme soak.
30787,Sheldon,All right Elizabeth the bathroom is yours. The seat is down and has been sanitized for your protection.
30788,Howard,Yes but I’m finding that having a lackey suits me.
30789,Raj,We don’t have any of those.
30790,Howard,Well let’s see. Yup three missed calls.
30791,Sheldon,I am forgetting nothing and I resent your tone.
30792,Penny,No no. My point is uh tonight is Sheldon’s first official date. Discuss.
30793,Sheldon,Chaos theory suggests that even in a deterministic system if the equations describing its behaviour are non-linear a tiny change in the initial conditions can lead to a cataclysmic and unpredictable result.
30794,Sheldon,We might as well stop it’s a stalemate. You’re beating me in tetris but you’ve got the upper body strength of a Keebler Elf.
30795,Leonard,You’re gonna put alcohol in the punch?
30796,Leonard,This is ridiculous. You’re just making stuff up.
30797,Sheldon,What? That’s absurd. Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.
30798,Sheldon,Is that a relevant factor?
30799,Leonard,Happy birthday buddy.
30800,Leonard,All I said was she seems nice.
30801,Leonard,Of course not. No. Why?
30802,Leonard,Don’t you have any friends he can date?
30804,Sheldon,Oh Leonard you know I can’t do that.
30805,Raj,Wow it’s so cute.
30806,Sheldon,What do you want mom?
30807,Howard,Guys have you seen Stuart all up in Penny’s business over there?
30808,Penny,Are you drunk?
30809,Sheldon,Notice people on your own time. We’re working.
30810,Leonard,No it’s just something I threw on.
30811,Raj,Wait where are you going? We were doing so well. She never even got to see my penis. Ta-da!
30812,Sheldon,Fine.
30813,Leonard,I’m telling you you can’t create love in a few hours. Right?
30814,Sheldon,Actually I meant you could drive me. But if it makes you happy that other stuff too.
30815,Raj,So I thought the photo booth for the party could either be creepy like a mummy’s tomb or they also have the Tardis from Doctor Who.
30816,Sheldon,You want to be green?
30817,Sheldon,Section 74.C. The various obligations and duties of the parties in the event one of them becomes a robot.
30818,Penny,Why would she even do this?
30819,Penny,What?
30820,Raj,Well I just met her gynaecologist!
30821,Leonard,Hi Tom. Sheldon? Didn’t I explain to you about your little mistake in the cafeteria?
30822,Sheldon,Well you got me out of my pants.
30823,Raj,You get to choose between a mountain bike or a PS3.
30824,Raj,I don’t get it.
30825,Sheldon,Yeah you and me both sister. Now please understand I don’t hold you responsible for your behaviour because see from an evolutionary standpoint you’re a slave to your desire to reproduce. But during the work day when you feel possessed by amorous intent may I suggest that you suppress it by leafing through this illustrated book of sexually transmitted diseases? Let’s see here. Oh yes. Check out this oozy doozy.
30826,Howard,I don’t know.
30827,Leonard,Oh I’m getting a bad feeling.
30828,Raj,No one’s arguing with you dude.
30829,Leonard,Sheldon dinner’s here.
30830,Penny,Oh I’m sorry to hear that.
30831,Sheldon,Oh and no contact with guinea pigs or hamsters or their droppings uh no-no cat litter boxes no paint fumes.
30832,Raj,I was thinking it might be some sort of interstellar coordinate system maybe an updated version of Hubble’s law. I keep seeing the number 90 repeating. That could be the angle of perturbation of a distant galaxy.
30833,Penny,Nice.
30834,Raj,All I’ve got is a needler and I’m all out of ammo.
30835,Sheldon,Mother I have to go. Yeah love you. Bye.  Daddy’s home.
30836,Sheldon,That show ended with all the residents of New York either dead or unconscious. Oh now I’ll never know what happened.
30837,Sheldon,Oh that’s just a doodle of a hyperelliptic Riemann surface.
30838,Howard,It’s okay I’m fine.
30839,Leonard,No kidding?
30840,Leonard,Yeah.
30841,Howard,Uh yeah sorry. She’s just a little shy. The first time we met she was so nervous she climbed out a bathroom window to get away from me.
30843,Raj,I’m sorry. Honestly I didn’t think your job would bother me but I guess it did. And I hate myself for that. But there’s a lot of things about me that would totally embarrass you.
30844,Howard,That sounds really cool.
30845,Howard,Well if anyone’s interested I’ll be spending this Valentine’s Day the same way I spend every Valentine’s Day. Buying a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket taking it home standing over the sink and eating it out of the package with my bare hands like an animal.
30846,Raj,A total loser. Obviously a guy with a six-shooter beats an old man with a magic wand.
30847,Penny,Okay Raj here you go. Alright who’s next?
30848,Raj,If you were me would you kiss her?
30849,Leonard,What ya doing Skippy?
30850,Penny,Yeah. Well Sheldon’s not here.
30851,Penny,Did he Purell?
30852,Sheldon,That would be ideal. If a person like that existed I would sign on no further questions asked.
30853,Howard,I bought him dinner and we kissed once that was it.  And he told me his name was Kimberley!
30854,Leonard,Oh yeah there she is. Hi Mom.
30855,Leonard,Sure that has birds in it.
30856,Leonard,Why are you mad at me? You’re the one that did the stupid thing. I’m just trying to fix it.
30857,Sheldon,Yes there is. Oh here’s a fun fact ketchup started out as a general term for sauce typically made of uh mushrooms or fish brine with herbs and spices. Some popular early main ingredients included blueberry anchovy oyster kidney bean and grape.
30858,Raj,You can’t come in.
30859,Sheldon,I believe the Internal Revenue Service would strongly disagree. But if you took advantage of modern marketing techniques and you optimized your manufacturing process you might be able to make this a viable business.
30860,Sheldon,Oh really? She and I once had a staring contest. She clapped really loud and made me blink. It’s a small leap from there to sexual infidelity.
30861,Leonard,Shooting at a target?
30862,Sheldon,If you’re concerned about sharing credit with me you’re name can go first… I’m going.
30863,Leonard,Sounds yummy. I look forward to your work with bacon.
30864,Penny,Do not overthink this. 
30865,Leonard,So?
30866,Penny,Who I hope for her sake is not Captain Hook so… who are you calling?
30867,Sheldon,Think carefully here. Clause 209 suspends our friendship and strips down the roommate agreement to its bare essentials. Our responsibilities toward each other would only be rent utilities and a perfunctory chin jut of recognition as we pass in the hall.  ‘Sup?
30868,Leonard,Keep going.
30869,Raj,You know Sheldon…
30870,Leonard,Again no…
30871,Raj,Forbaded it?
30872,Leonard,You get to play with Raj’s big telescope last night?
30873,Howard,Oh it’s okay. I have no morals and I’m desperately lonely. I’ll be the other man if you want a little something-something on the side.
30874,Leonard,Okay we’re almost ready to go. Once we bond the wires we can test the tubes.
30875,Sheldon,Hello.
30876,Leonard,We had a full spool yesterday.
30877,Sheldon,Yes.
30878,Sheldon,Well what exactly do you mean by embarrass you?
30879,Penny,Yeah. Why not I mean what do I have to lose?
30880,Penny,Was that a science diss?
30881,Leonard,Not yet.
30882,Sheldon,Amy Farrah Fowler will you share this toothbrush holder with me?
30883,Penny,What? No that’s not what I’m saying.
30884,Penny,You’re gonna have to do it when you’re fishing.
30885,Sheldon,Age seven a blood-thirsty chicken chases me up a tree. Age twelve a magpie tries to steal the retainer out of my mouth. Age sixteen a parrot in a pet store called me fat ass. Need I go on?
30887,Leonard,Oh come on I hardly ever get a chance to play anymore.
30888,Sheldon,Well she doesn’t care for hotels. And who can blame her? Windows that don’t open multi-user linens keys shaped like credit cards as if one walks around with unassigned slots in one’s wallet. All right I believe I have time for one more question. Yes Raj?
30889,Sheldon,Yes. Oh for example three years ago when I discovered Penny was eating all my Pop-Tarts instead of getting angry or vindictive you know I got a floor safe.
30890,Sheldon,But what if we can’t?
30891,Howard,What’s wrong with you?
30892,Penny,What?
30893,Howard,Thank you. Not just for being upset but for believing that could happen.
30894,Howard,Well I can’t take all the credit. She let me do it to her but uh but I can always call her and cancel.
30895,Sheldon,I had the same feeling when I made my dad buy a Betamax instead of a VHS.
30896,Howard,Wait till you see the crib we found.
30897,Sheldon,Indeed. If I’m to participate in the social convention that is the stag night then I must embrace all its components including tobacco swear words and yes alcohol. Jeepers! That’s yucky.
30898,Howard,You know many people believe that home births are better because the mother is in a warm comfortable environment where she can be nurtured by loved ones.
30899,Sheldon,Too bad. If it’d been a friend I’m available to fill the void.  It’s just as well she smelled like moth balls.
30900,Sheldon,I was trying to see what was in here and my head got stuck.
30901,Raj,Sure.
30903,Sheldon,I’m a grown man.
30904,Raj,Good night Sheldon.
30905,Sheldon,Good good. I’m glad we’re still friends.
30906,Penny,Because Leonard just pissed me off. Am I being an idiot or not?
30907,Penny,Hey Leonard. What’s going on with Dr. Wackadoodle?
30908,Howard,Well okay I’m gonna sign off now. This next part may contain some adult language.
30909,Penny,I do. 
30910,Raj,I’ve missed you.
30911,Sheldon,I’m just talking about bees. They’re on the discovery channel. What are you talking about?
30912,Howard,Yes for you. I do however have a few conditions. First at all times I am to be treated as a colleague and an equal. Second my contributions shall be noted in all published material. And third you are never allowed to lecture me on Hinduism or my Indian culture.
30913,Leonard,No the place to have the conversation was in bed after I said I love you and you said Thank you good night.
30914,Leonard,Sounds like a breakthrough should I call the science magazines and tell them to hold the front cover? 
30915,Raj,Yay.
30916,Howard,Aren’t you gonna eat lunch?
30917,Penny,Oh it’s funny I was just thinking the same thing about you.
30918,Sheldon,Yeah he’s right. Oh here’s a thought. What if we use some form of operant conditioning techniques to keep us from getting off topic?
30919,Sheldon,I just thought you were bad at the game.
30920,Leonard,Does that mean you’d relocate here permanently?
30921,Howard,What up guys?
30922,Raj,I think we already have. Thank you guys so much. Let’s see if you fit in my man purse.
30923,Howard,Scotty I need more power.
30924,Raj,Well if you leave now you can be back before the gorillas rip the crap out of Charlton Heston.
30925,Leonard,Okay I’m out of here.
30926,Penny,Well he heard me making plans on the phone. Was I going to say no?
30927,Penny,Really I am not upset about Leonard and Priya.
30928,Penny,Sheldon I’m sure it’s going to be fine.
30929,Sheldon,That’s insane on the face of it. Come on.
30930,Sheldon,Yuh-uh one more question if you’re going to replace Wolowitz I need to know a little more about you.
30931,Sheldon,I grew up in Texas. Football is ubiquitous in Texas. Pro football college football high school football peewee football in fact every form of football except the original European football which most Texans believe to be a Commie plot.
30933,Sheldon,Thank you for the invitation but I have to decline because it doesn’t sound like something I’ll enjoy.
30934,Leonard,Well he is here. So unless you want to dig him out with a bone saw and a melon baller there’s nothing I can do about it.
30935,Leonard,Oh my God.
30936,Howard,Why?
30937,Sheldon,It is nice isn’t it?
30939,Sheldon,Yes. No yeah but in his defense that wasn’t racist. He’s also brown.
30940,Leonard,What are you talking about?
30941,Sheldon,Thank you. My father taught me archery as a child. It’s odd how the activity brings back the smell of Kmart bourbon.
30942,Sheldon,The Jewish people.
30943,Raj,It’s pretty exciting that NASA wants to send Howard back up.
30944,Penny,This is for you.
30945,Sheldon,I did learn how to swim.
30946,Sheldon,Taylor Swift.
30947,Howard,I don’t think it matters. Look Sheldon I believe when the time is right for you to meet someone it’ll just happen. Okay? Not because of a test or a Web site but because…  we are the dreamers of dreams.
30948,Sheldon,Alright what response on my part would bring this conversation to a speedy conclusion?
30949,Howard,So I was reading how it’s a good idea for new parents to take an infant CPR class.
30950,Sheldon,Everyone will see my oddly shaped uvula.
30951,Howard,From the future? How fun and imaginative.
30952,Raj,I’d like that. This is turning out to be a perfect Saturday.
30953,Raj,I know. You guys should totally be making out with me.
30954,Howard,I don’t know.
30955,Leonard,Oh congratulations. Have you broken it to the troll yet?
30956,Howard,Yeah but he doesn’t mean it.
30958,Sheldon,I left them in the bowl.
30959,Leonard,No no no would it help if I told you that I offered her my heart and she kind of stomped on it.
30960,Sheldon,Excuse me Stuart. Have you read the new Flash?
30961,Leonard,You realize he’s just rubbing our noses in the fact that he has a girlfriend and we don’t.
30962,Sheldon,I’m checking for musical instruments. Does that sound like castanets to you?
30963,Leonard,Well now be careful these are hot. i could explain the thermodynamics of why the cheese seems hotter than the crust but instead I’m gonna keep it to myself.
30964,Raj,Thanks for inviting me after everyone else said no. Aren’t you gonna get 3-D glasses?
30965,Raj,Yeah it was. But it’s my father’s money and I’m mad at him.
30966,Penny,Well why are you fighting him on this?
30967,Penny,Hang on. Wait wait. Why don’t I like the lingerie you got me?
30968,Howard,Nope. I guess the heart wants what the heart wants. Or in this case doesn’t I mean at all. What?
30969,Leonard,Yes that’s what I’m telling you. We are good. We are great.
30970,Sheldon,Like when you let me get those shoes with the wheels on the bottom and then watched me roll right into traffic?
30971,Sheldon,Hold on. Just because the nice man is offering you candy doesn’t mean you should jump into his windowless van. What’s the occasion?
30972,Penny,I’m sorry why old?
30973,Sheldon,I will.
30974,Leonard,Okay yeah. I can see the difference.
30975,Leonard,I’m not surprised. A well known folk cure for insomnia is to break into your neighbour’s apartment and clean.
30976,Leonard,What’s your problem?
30977,Sheldon,This isn’t over.
30978,Sheldon,No you said you couldn’t drive me to work this is from work.
30979,Raj,So you never played baseball as a kid not even Little League?
30980,Leonard,Yes you’re forbidden.
30981,Leonard,Yeah. It’s a front-projected holographic display combined with laser-based finger tracking. Here I’ll show you. We’ll just put this pencil over here.
30982,Sheldon,I assumed as much. But never fear. Like the subordinate male protagonist in countless action movies who disappears half way through the second reel I have returned to save the day. Odd usually he’s met by cheers. Anyway I was thinking about exploring the string theory implications of gamma rays from dark matter annihilations and it occurred to me that I could benefit…
30983,Sheldon,Oh no I got bored with that. I’m just browsing cuticle scissors on Amazon.
30984,Raj,You want a TUMS?
30985,Penny,Interesting you didn’t mention Amy.
30986,Leonard,Okay uh…. oh consider this. With your father gone it is your responsibility to make sure that Missy chooses a suitable mate.
30987,Howard,I do. And some of it’s wool so dry flat if possible.
30988,Leonard,I was thinking maybe a library or a gaming room.
30989,Howard,All right I’ve got your back.
30990,Penny,No.
30991,Sheldon,Where’s Stuart?
30992,Penny,Oh that’s so nice I’d love to.
30993,Penny,Can he really throw a ball?
30994,Howard,Okay I’m good.
30995,Sheldon,What didn’t they get? They got my enchanted weapons my vicious gladiator armour my wand of untainted power and all my gold.
30996,Sheldon,It wasn’t easy. Was it Buzz?
30997,Howard,Great.
30998,Sheldon,Oh I stopped that it was dumb. Uni bi tri menstrual all cycles are dumb.
30999,Penny,You deliberately stuck me with Sheldon.
31000,Leonard,Yeah not my point.
31001,Raj,There are independent voice and fingerprint scanners.
31002,Sheldon,Oh no thank you those have caffeine in them.
31003,Leonard,What kind of guys did you used to go out with?
31004,Sheldon,Spock?
31005,Penny,Oh you have to invite him. I haven’t seen him since the divorce.
31006,Leonard,This is good. Our idea is really good.
31007,Penny,I don’t know.
31008,Penny,No.
31009,Sheldon,You know what they don’t sell at The Container Store? Something large enough to contain my disappointment. Although if anyone did it would be them.
31010,Leonard,Should we go bring him back?
31011,Sheldon,Did you get hit on the head with a coconut?
31012,Leonard,You know what baffles me Sheldon?
31013,Leonard,Sheldon I’m just not dating someone right now. I don’t need to go to a senior centre.
31014,Sheldon,Well I don’t know what to say. This is the most thoughtful gift that anyone’s ever given me. And that’s including an amazing gift that I gave myself earlier today.
31015,Sheldon,Socks one pair cotton argyle blue. Socks one pair cotton argyle blue.
31016,Sheldon,Penny. I realize you are also on your own tonight so if at some point you find yourself with nothing to do please do not disturb me.
31017,Howard,Dude how many races can you offend in a single breath?
31018,Howard,Are you sure you can do this?
31019,Penny,You know why.
31020,Sheldon,Okay. Do you think your father’s doing unspeakable things to my mother?
31021,Sheldon,Great.
31022,Leonard,I only bring it up because your ice-cream is melting and it’s starting to attract wildlife.
31023,Sheldon,Good.
31024,Howard,Yes which is why she was in the telescope room. Yes this is all making sense. Good.
31025,Leonard,Uh that that’s not necessary.
31026,Sheldon,A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has made an amazing leap forward.
31027,Leonard,Why would you tell him that? That’s terrible advice.
31028,Sheldon,Oh how about Bill Gates meets Nikola Tesla?
31029,Leonard,Oh yeah. I’m so… oh that’s terrible.
31030,Leonard,It’s not just that. My mother would kill me if I let something happen to him.
31031,Penny,So when is it?
31032,Leonard,Well nailed it.
31033,Howard,What? He beat out George Clooney and that’s something. Like I love me some Clooney.
31034,Leonard,Hmm to be honest it’s kind of a dream come true to go to even a fake prom with a woman as beautiful as you.
31035,Leonard,He’s tearing the mask off nature to look at the face of God.
31036,Leonard,Here’s your cocoa.
31037,Sheldon,Excuse me. I’m recovering from a recent breakup and I’m told asking out another woman might make me feel better. And as Ash Ketchum said to Pikachu I choose you.
31038,Leonard,Please don’t tell anyone I spent the night with Raj’s sister.
31039,Leonard,Oh nothing. Just some math we don’t need.
31040,Leonard,What am I smelling?
31041,Leonard,Why don’t we just go into your….
31042,Penny,Hi.
31043,Sheldon,Do not stop refreshing your screens.
31044,Sheldon,She was attempting to engage me in gossip.
31045,Sheldon,Hello.
31046,Howard,I’ve reconsidered your offer to let me work with you.
31047,Sheldon,What happened?
31048,Leonard,Oh buddy I get that you don’t like it but it’s not really up to you.
31049,Leonard,It’s pretty cool. We’ve got a two-meter parabolic reflector and everything. I thought you might want to see it.
31051,Penny,What do you mean how? What’s the big deal?
31052,Penny,Yeah I’m not really clear on what that means.
31053,Leonard,Remember when you were wondering why the girls didn’t want to eat with us tonight?
31054,Sheldon,You have a back-up hypothesis.
31055,Sheldon,Yes.
31056,Leonard,They kind of spoil the ending right in the name of that don’t they? All right. Look just remember how this works. We don’t get mad about these things. Uh speaking of which I’ve addressed your bug report on my date planning. Got a really fun evening for you. It’s kind of a surprise.
31057,Raj,Ugh Toby what did you do in a past life to be so disgusting now?
31058,Howard,Plus this is where our minds are conditioned to focus on work.
31059,Leonard,Are you sure that your being drunk and your being angry with Kurt doesn’t have something to do with what’s going on here?
31060,Penny,Okay correct me if I’m wrong but isn’t that exactly what we were supposed to stop from happening?
31061,Leonard,See ya. ‘Bye Penny. Have fun. 
31062,Howard,I’m a good listener.
31063,Penny,All right you know what you need? A night away from all of this. You know where you can just kind of relax and I’m just gonna turn this off. Much better. Seriously let’s plan a night you know give you a break. We could go dancing.
31064,Howard,I can’t believe this is only 64 calories.
31065,Leonard,You got it.
31066,Sheldon,Oh fun. Like a play date.
31067,Sheldon,Well get over it. Confidence is key in these situations.
31068,Sheldon,I’m sorry for every mean thing I ever did or said to you.
31069,Raj,You always say that but we never do.
31070,Sheldon,That is a daring and insightful solution.
31071,Penny,Four dozen?
31072,Howard,Leonard what are you talking about?
31073,Raj,What? No. ..
31074,Sheldon,Yes. Apparently I’m getting a free dinner.
31075,Raj,Okay here’s another one If a zombie bites a vampire and the vampire bites a human does the human become a vampire or a zombie? Or a zompire?
31076,Raj,Without me.
31077,Leonard,Well well they’ve known each other a long time and Penny grew up around horses so she knows how to approach him without making him skittish.
31078,Sheldon,I’m sick thank you very much.
31079,Howard,Oh she’s here.
31080,Sheldon,Someone in Sezchuan province China is using his computer to turn our lights on and off.
31081,Sheldon,Are you sure? We were making fun of failed careers. We didn’t get to tap the juicy vein that is Howard’s.
31082,Leonard,Terrific.
31083,Penny,That is so hot.
31084,Sheldon,Thanks Leonard now he’s not gonna think I’m cool.
31085,Leonard,I hope so.
31086,Sheldon,Frankly Mom I’m encouraged to see how advanced your group has become willing to sail out into the ocean without fear of falling off the edge.
31087,Leonard,I honestly don’t care.
31088,Raj,Yeah-yeah which way?
31089,Howard,From that happy young couple over there with all the tattoos. Beautiful story they’re in rival drug gangs and they’re getting married. Shh no one can know.
31090,Sheldon,That’s it. We’re done with the questions.
31091,Penny,Okay he can have carrot cake.
31092,Penny,I can’t believe it. If I hadn’t been working the dinner shift I would’ve run
31093,Raj,Oh that’s a shame he’s gonna be devastated.
31094,Leonard,No no I’m okay it’s stopped bleeding.
31095,Raj,Tricking Penny into getting engaged.
31096,Sheldon,I did.
31097,Howard,I’m sorry. Go on.
31098,Penny,Yeah I probably won’t but… Hey Sheldon.
31099,Sheldon,Why are you smiling?
31100,Leonard,None?
31101,Raj,Oh you have to be down there for 12 hours at a time.
31102,Sheldon,Listen to this. I just received an e-mail from Wil Wheaton. Leonard Nimoy’s son is working on a documentary that he started with his father before he passed away. It’s about Mr. Spock and his impact on our culture.
31103,Raj,I read that in Los Angeles raising a child through college can cost over a million dollars.
31104,Penny,Why not?
31105,Penny,Busy.
31106,Raj,No not at all.
31107,Raj,Oh okay. Good. I don’t need more comics. Howard’s gonna stop by we’re gonna play intergalactic battleship and Indian Monopoly.
31108,Leonard,You’re joking.
31109,Leonard,Oh come on! Why don’t we just tell them that we’re dating?
31110,Leonard,I’d like to kick your little brown ass.
31111,Penny,Oh. Hey Leonard.
31112,Leonard,Okay Mom you sit over there.
31113,Leonard,Once I tried carrying around a Duncan yo-yo hoping the other kids would start calling me Duncan.
31114,Howard,Hmm. They must have left the tub on. Good thing I stopped by. Ah. Aaaaah! What are you doing here?
31115,Sheldon,No I’m not giving up I never give up.
31116,Sheldon,It says keep this on your person at all times.  It’s right here under Batman’s signature.
31117,Sheldon,All right fine. Let’s just play.
31118,Penny,And yet you bore his child. Neato.
31119,Sheldon,And just remember I am proud of you and I support you in all that you do.
31120,Penny,Oh there he is.
31121,Leonard,You won.
31122,Penny,Get away from me or I swear to God I will rip out what’s left of your pubes!
31123,Leonard,Sheldon.
31124,Penny,Oh um I I can come back.
31125,Sheldon,Then why are you doing it?
31126,Raj,Better. I guess the news just hit me a lot harder than I expected.
31127,Howard,You guys know the new Discovery class missions that NASA’s been working on?
31128,Leonard,Yup just want to get married.
31129,Penny,Sheldon here is your money. Thank you very much. It helped a lot.
31130,Sheldon,How can I? You won’t stop talking about it.
31131,Leonard,Really? Because I just heard will you marry me? That’s two proposals one day. Sounds like someone wants to spend the rest of her life telling people how to spell the name Hofstadter.
31132,Raj,I’m not surprised. Despite his hard and crusty shell Howard is a very sensitive man. Do you know he writes poetry? Mostly about men from Nantucket and hermits named Dave but he does it with real sensitivity.
31133,Leonard,Oh. Football sure.
31134,Raj,Totally you.
31135,Leonard,Look I admit it I may have crossed a line here but come on Raj your sister is a grown woman. To her I’m a forbidden piece of white chocolate.
31136,Leonard,Magnets What Do They Stick To? If the answer is metal it’s not exactly groundbreaking.
31137,Leonard,Really? That’s impressive.
31138,Sheldon,And that’s why you’re not on a list for my tree fort. Ooh guess who’s getting an article written about him in Physics Today? I’ll give you a hint. You measured the diameter of his suspicious mole yesterday.
31139,Leonard,Yeah sure that might be fun.
31140,Penny,Yeah that’s a toughie.
31141,Penny,Soft kitty warm kitty little ball of fur. Happy kitty sleepy kitty purr purr purr.
31142,Leonard,No I’m a Hobbit.
31143,Penny,Why would you say that?
31144,Sheldon,No it’s yucky but informing people about the history of Yorkshire is yummy yum-yum.
31145,Sheldon,To be honest I didn’t know you were here.
31146,Sheldon,No I could’ve done more.
31147,Sheldon,Oh Dr. Nowitzki is a woman.
31148,Howard,Oh sure I sit on the floor for years no one cares. The pretty white girl’s there ten seconds and suddenly we’re all running to IKEA.
31149,Sheldon,Stems removed?
31150,Sheldon,Oh I had an accident at work I slipped and fell on my soup sack.
31152,Penny,Oh. You’re right. I’m worried about something that hasn’t even happened yet. Huh. You are a wise man.
31153,Sheldon,Good. Then I’ll be leaving now.
31154,Raj,No think about it. We make it an experiment. Like when Frankenstein’s monster was lonely and he found a wife.
31155,Sheldon,Aha! Good question. It turns out the thermostat for my new office isn’t in my new office. No. It’s next door in Professor Davenport’s office who is currently enjoying the hot flashes associated with menopause.
31156,Leonard,No if you can talk to them you can ask them out.
31157,Howard,Hello. Oh it’s so good to see you.
31158,Leonard,When you say mistake do you mean a fortunate mistake like the discovery of penicillin?
31159,Howard,Yes.
31160,Raj,Ooh ooh. Did the pigeon on your windowsill have more babies?
31161,Howard,I like it I like it. Did they smell good despite their gothlike nature?
31162,Penny,I told him to take it down. He would not listen to me.
31163,Penny,So I hear you and the lost boys are having a bachelor party tonight.
31164,Sheldon,If I may speak for Comic-Con we don’t want that either.
31165,Howard,Yeah screw it. I’m going in.
31166,Leonard,Not really.
31167,Leonard,No regular.
31168,Sheldon,Are you still depressed because you’re alone and no one loves you?
31169,Howard,Dude what is she saying?
31170,Leonard,Why?
31171,Leonard,Yeah for a little while.
31173,Penny,Put on your noise-cancelling headphones ’cause it’s gonna get loud.
31174,Raj,No. We are very wealthy. But the only difference is we have more servants.
31175,Penny,Yeah let’s go.
31176,Leonard,Yeah he worships Hawking.
31177,Sheldon,If I could I would but I can’t so I shan’t. Now knowing Penny the obvious answer is they engaged in coitus. But since that’s what it looked like we can rule that out. Let’s put on our thinking cap shall we?  Yes just like that. Penny could have been inspecting Raj’s anal region for parasites. Oh boy. That’s a true blue friend.
31178,Leonard,Well so do I but they’ll never let us.
31179,Sheldon,Excellent. I’m very hungry. Speaking of which what’s going on with your apartment?
31180,Howard,It’s your anniversary? Oh my God I had no idea. Amy please let me make this right.
31181,Leonard,No I’m pretty sure my anger’s with you.
31182,Leonard,She’s good.
31183,Howard,You know I have too much self-esteem to let this girl guilt me into getting back together with her.
31185,Penny,I don’t know I guess I like that I hate it. It makes me work harder.
31186,Howard,Okay and here’s the hook. Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning the other plays with bones.
31187,Penny,Yeah I’m saying it’d be easier to lift a car.
31188,Sheldon,A word of warning. My guest is a noted physicist and the leading expert on quantum cosmology so please try to avoid wasting her time with female jibber jabber.
31189,Howard,That’s okay I’m fine.
31190,Sheldon,Vaporub makes my hands smell funny.
31191,Leonard,I still don’t know why you left.
31192,Leonard,I’d still like to know who Jerry is.
31193,Penny,No no they’re really not.
31194,Raj,You crimson coward! Oh Leonard wake up you’re missing some very excellent superhero quips.
31195,Sheldon,Well I’ve been doing some research and I’ve learned that one in 700000 people die from general anaesthesia.
31196,Raj,Howard get out.
31197,Sheldon,Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment I have awakened at 615 poured myself a bowl of cereal added a quarter cup of 2% milk sat on this end of this couch turned on BBC America and watched Doctor Who.
31198,Sheldon,It’s brilliant. He needs to read it.
31199,Sheldon,Who knows? Uh you said you’d be home yesterday but you came home three days ago. You say you’re taking me to work but for all I know I’ll end up in a deserted amusement park. Or a cornfield maze. Or a back alley dog fight. You tell me.
31200,Penny,You pick plenty of movies.
31201,Penny,We didn’t mean for it to be an ambush. Just it’s kind of impossible not to sneak up on deaf people. And hey since when are you so chatty?
31202,Raj,Actually that’s why I’m calling. I um I just I need to let you know that I have a girlfriend.
31203,Leonard,You know too.
31204,Penny,You guys should’ve seen Leonard when I first met him. There was no eye contact. He was either looking up at the ceiling or down at his shoes.
31205,Sheldon,Oh that hardly seems fair. But I guess any team that I’m not on has a decided disadvantage.
31206,Sheldon,Pay attention Leonard. That’s why she can’t play on Sunday.
31207,Leonard,That’s a biological impossibility and you didn’t have to come.
31208,Sheldon,Interesting. You see betrayal in others but not yourself.
31209,Leonard,Because when he wasn’t happy we wanted to kill him. There was even a plan. We were going to throw his Kindle outside and when he went to get it lock the door and let him freeze to death.
31210,Sheldon,Because if I don’t he won’t give my paper to Stephen Hawking. He’s a famous physicist.
31211,Penny,Well the diner scene. Where’s my diner scene?
31212,Leonard,I’m listening.
31213,Sheldon,Like has Leonard betrayed any of his friends recently?
31214,Sheldon,Easily calculable we begin by identifying the set of married couples with unisex names. We then eliminate those unqualified for restaurant work the aged the imprisoned and the limbless for example. Next we look at…
31215,Sheldon,Your Klingon word-of-the-day calendar’s gone.
31216,Raj,Pretty good. She bought the book Eat Pray Love and used it to set my father’s Mercedes on fire. So what’s up with you guys?
31217,Penny,Oh here come the mummies which spell do I use? The hateful strike or the frenzy stance?
31218,Penny,Yeah no there’s a new policy. No shoes no shirt no Sheldon.
31219,Leonard,I would have asked you. In my head. On the way home. While I was having a good cry.
31220,Penny,There’s no symposium Leonard lied to me isn’t that right Leonard.
31221,Howard,That sounds like a yes.
31222,Penny,All right Sheldon this is over the line.
31223,Penny,Well then who?
31224,Sheldon,What?
31225,Penny,Pretty good. I actually just got assigned a much better territory.
31226,Penny,Well did you tell him that?
31227,Penny,What happens if you don’t?
31228,Howard,Yeah we’re coming for you Todd Zarnecki. And for the record Legoland is more interactive.
31229,Howard,It was like a snowy nightmare from which there was no awakening.
31230,Howard,Look Howard you’re in a relationship. You know you have to make compromises.
31231,Penny,Oh.
31232,Leonard,No.
31233,Penny,Interesting. I never told you that.
31234,Leonard,Let me explain what we’re doing here. Um in 1969 the astronauts on Apollo 11 positioned reflectors on the surface of the moon and we’re going to shoot a laser off one of them and let the light bounce back into this photomultiplier.
31235,Leonard,Can we talk in private?
31236,Penny,It’s just rum. It stopped being eggnog like half an hour ago.
31237,Penny,Sheldon you cannot just barge in here like that.
31238,Sheldon,Vintage? Be specific.
31239,Leonard,Are we gonna be much longer? I really have to go to the bathroom.
31240,Leonard,Ooh and one time when you were asleep Amy totally took off her… and that’s why you’re the best roommate ever.
31241,Raj,Thank you.
31242,Raj,Is that the American idiom for giant big-ass desk?
31243,Leonard,Yep.
31244,Leonard,I I didn’t want to interrupt.
31245,Sheldon,Does this mean you’re not going to sing Soft Kitty?
31246,Penny,OMG. OMG. We’re so close to the new Star Wars. I can’t take it. Gah. Gah?
31247,Leonard,Fine. Mmm Penny’s beauty like our love grows more with each passing day.”
31248,Leonard,A little but if I may quote Einstein the pursuit of science calls us to ignore the rules set by man.
31249,Sheldon,You want me to read a geology paper?
31250,Raj,If you really want to clean up your karma go get my freakin’ latte.
31251,Sheldon,Fun time. Hah. Sorry sometimes the clippers tickle me.
31252,Raj,I don’t think it matters. Look Sheldon I believe when the time is right for you to meet someone it’ll just happen. Okay? Not because of a test or a Web site but because…  we are the dreamers of dreams.
31253,Penny,Glad you’re enjoying yourself.
31254,Sheldon,You know what? If you’d like I could whip up a quick relationship agreement. Well I’m at a spa I might as well do something relaxing.
31255,Leonard,Thank you.
31256,Penny,It might be good for him.
31257,Howard,She does.
31258,Howard,Well I just met her gynaecologist!
31259,Leonard,Ah it was all right I guess. Got to Heimlich a cherry stem out of Sheldon. Caught Raj right in the eye.
31260,Raj,No it’s chilly outside. Didn’t bring my jacket.
31261,Sheldon,What if someone steals my keys?
31262,Sheldon, Raj.
31265,Leonard,I don’t want to talk about it.
31266,Raj,In the last two hours 162 women have read our profiles. How many of them have sent us messages?
31267,Leonard,Why would you say that?
31268,Raj,This is fun. I have never cleaned a toilet before.
31269,Leonard,Oh come on you know that’s not true.
31270,Leonard,Sure.
31271,Penny,Oh that’s cool.
31272,Leonard,Drop axe.
31273,Raj,It’s okay. I don’t mind hearing about your sex life. It’s his that bugs me.
31274,Raj,Well okay I’m gonna sign off now. This next part may contain some adult language.
31275,Raj,I’m trying but you have to admit this is pretty damn funny.
31276,Raj,A time share time machine? I’m in. Sheldon?
31277,Raj,Wait hang on. If you’re really Nathan Fillion what’s the line from Firefly about your bonnet?
31278,Leonard,Oh how’d it go last night?
31280,Penny,Mm-hmm.
31281,Sheldon,Well I’m from Texas and you’re from India we’re no strangers to the fragrant armpit. Next.
31282,Leonard,This weekend.
31283,Howard,Dude that’s my sister you’re talking about.
31284,Leonard,I think we need to start entertaining the possibility that the Shamy could go on for years.
31285,Raj,Oh yeah right. Sorry. My name is Puss in Boots. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
31286,Penny,Okay a simple yes will do.
31287,Leonard,That was San Diego Comic-Con. This is Bakersfield Comic-Con.
31288,Leonard,Shame on her.
31289,Leonard,You want some of this? I’ll give you some.
31290,Howard,This is the difference between eating and dining.
31291,Penny,Because it’s important to him and when we signed the roommate agreement we made a deal.
31292,Sheldon,And the Klingon High Council…
31293,Sheldon,I’m sorry that’s not going to interest me at all just eat.
31294,Raj,I was Googling that girl I’ve been dating and I found her blog.
31295,Leonard,Thank you.
31296,Sheldon,Oh. Thank you.
31297,Sheldon,What if she’s correct? Doesn’t that say something troubling about us?
31298,Sheldon,No no please come in. Yeah I think you’ll appreciate this very exciting.
31299,Sheldon,It’s the story of a young boy who is transported from the ignorant backwoods of East Texas to the 23rd Century where his genius is not only appreciated but celebrated.
31300,Leonard,I smell nothing.
31301,Leonard,About what?
31302,Sheldon,But change is a part of life.
31303,Sheldon,That woman looks exactly like the pictures of Princess Punchali in the book. How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to life?
31304,Sheldon,Yes. I’ve decided to embrace all of the traditions associated with prom including spiking the punch.
31305,Leonard,Well you know what’s gonna happen he’s just gonna come up with some reason why everything should be his.
31306,Sheldon,So in conclusion I believe the painful sensation felt after passing a meal of spicy chillies is proof that the rectum does possess the sense of taste.
31307,Raj,Sheldon she’s fine.
31308,Leonard,No.
31309,Penny,No we weren’t really like that. I mean look we played pranks on each other but it was never mean. Like okay this one girl Kathy Geiger got really good grades so we blindfolded her tied her up and left her in a cornfield overnight.
31310,Penny,Okay. What do you watch on Thanksgiving?
31311,Leonard,Excuse me but Einstein had a pretty busy sex life.
31312,Sheldon,They have Twizzlers instead of Red Vines. No amount of lumbar support can compensate for that.
31313,Penny,What?
31314,Leonard,Oh God.
31315,Sheldon,All right. In 4D chess…
31316,Raj,Well I would’ve slept in my own bed but it was being used to bring shame to my family. And the memory of Gene Roddenberry.
31317,Leonard,What did he say?
31318,Sheldon,Okay one second.
31319,Sheldon,Well as I predicted I am sick. My fever has been tracking up exponentially since 2am and I am producing sputum at an alarming rate.
31320,Leonard,I’m sorry. I did I crossed a line. I didn’t mean to!
31321,Howard,That’s not the point.
31322,Sheldon,Oh I’m fantastic never been better. I had my first energy drink and I feel great. Hey you guys want to wrestle? We can do arm thumb mud sumo. Nah we’re not fat enough or wearing diapers.
31323,Sheldon,Amy please. I am trying to figure out a way to intellectually emasculate a dear friend of mine.
31324,Penny,Get out!
31325,Howard,Wow.
31326,Sheldon,Is it the geometry that makes it fun.
31327,Leonard,But all you did was complain when he did that.
31328,Leonard,Sorry thank you.
31329,Sheldon,Thank you but I’ll be fine.
31330,Penny,No. I’m saying you and string theory sound like a relationship and I know what it’s like to be in one and realize it’s never gonna turn out the way you want.
31331,Leonard,Well what if you get it?
31332,Raj,Painfully so. We have this rule on the phone that if no one talks for three minutes you can just hang up. So into her.
31333,Sheldon,If we were the food would be better.
31334,Leonard,Ow! Ow!
31335,Penny,So what do you think? I mean this could be a business right?
31336,Leonard,I’m sorry Sheldon. I can’t help you. Oh spoiler alert this door’s about to slam in your face.
31337,Sheldon,Well I really need to go to the bathroom and this one’s gone all cattywampus.
31338,Sheldon,That’s exactly what my father said. Come to the games watch the games week in and week out from the time I was five until I went off to college. Longest seven years of my life.
31339,Sheldon,Let me ask you a question. At any point was Las Vegas on its side?
31340,Penny,Hi. Sorry I’m late I was at an audition.
31341,Sheldon,What’d you do delete your photo?
31342,Sheldon,Howard please. This is Stephen Hawking. Perhaps my only intellectual equal.
31343,Sheldon,And I’m not? It’s an earthquake. I knew it.
31344,Leonard,No I think a doorknob has you stymied.
31345,Sheldon,Good one boss.
31346,Sheldon,Offer them a hot beverage.
31347,Leonard,Yes. Um is this the High IQ sperm bank?
31348,Sheldon,I hate every word in that sentence. Including in at we and a.
31349,Leonard,Do I get some sympathy now?
31350,Penny,Hit me.
31351,Howard,What’s the matter?
31352,Sheldon,And I have nothing to contribute to this conversation. Because I too know absolutely nothing about Priya’s preferences in male companionship. And with that I will re-zip my lip.
31353,Sheldon,To Sheldon live long and prosper. Leonard Nimoy.
31354,Leonard,Okay so it wasn’t until his 21st birthday that Biff had will have placed his first bet and made his millions. That’s when he altered the timeline.
31355,Howard,What?
31356,Sheldon,That’s humorous.
31357,Sheldon,If it were fine the light wouldn’t be on. That’s why the manufacturer installed that light to let you know it’s not fine.
31358,Sheldon,I started doing some reading on cognitive vitality and I came across an area of research called super-aging.
31359,Penny,I don’t know maybe I have no idea what you said.
31361,Leonard,Why?
31362,Raj,Yeah. Hey you know if this was in Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment I wouldn’t wind up sitting on the floor all the time.
31363,Leonard,All right let me rephrase the question. Why are you wearing long underwear?
31364,Penny,What the hell is your problem?
31365,Raj,I do have a pretty balls-to-the-wall moisturising regimen.
31366,Sheldon,My new roommate is bending over backwards to ingratiate himself to me.  Uh nice touch by the way.
31367,Leonard,Oh hi.
31368,Howard,Yeah it’s pretty great.
31370,Howard,I think the next time I have to speak to a call centre in India I’m going to try using an American accent.
31371,Howard,It’s my one move.
31372,Raj,Wrong smarty-pants. It’s Everything Is Awesome from The Lego Movie.
31373,Penny,All right we work at a giant pharmaceutical company. Get him some anti-anxiety meds.
31374,Penny,Oh no no I said I’m inviting you to come with me to Stan Lee’s house.
31375,Leonard,Oh okay. I just hope I don’t get cramps.
31376,Leonard,Why do I have to talk to Penny? She’s not my girlfriend.
31377,Sheldon,No congratulations will have been in order. You know I’m not going to enjoy this party.
31378,Howard,Yeah okay.
31379,Sheldon,Oh hello.
31380,Sheldon,I think it’s her time of the month. I marked the calendar for future reference.
31381,Leonard,The guy who seems like an emotionless robot is you but your relationship with Amy is causing you to transform into a red-blooded man with sexual desires.
31382,Sheldon,It’s a common mistake.
31383,Sheldon,Well have fun.
31384,Sheldon,Oh congratulations.
31385,Penny,Great. Was it hard getting it up the stairs?
31386,Sheldon,Oh that sounds terrible. Why would I want to do that?
31387,Sheldon,I’m impressed Raj. Those are very cogent and reasonable conditions.
31388,Leonard,Very much.
31389,Howard,Dude you have to stop talking like that. It’s really lame.
31390,Leonard,Sorry again.
31391,Penny,So I was thinking how excited you get about stuff like Buffy or science or which TV remote you and Sheldon should buy.
31392,Sheldon,Ooh Siam Palace?
31393,Leonard,Well who wants to stay in a hotel? With windows that don’t open those crazy card-shaped keys.
31394,Sheldon,I would think he would know that.
31395,Penny,Oh I’m sorry honey I’m meeting Amy and Bernadette for dinner. But you’re welcome to tag along.
31396,Sheldon,If he understands that you’re in trouble.
31397,Sheldon,Oh but I want to be Hawking’s friend.
31398,Sheldon,There’s probably a deep reason. Which I’d be happy to discuss with you over some peanut brittle in a can.
31399,Sheldon,But what about our agreement?
31400,Sheldon,Go on give him your lunch money.
31401,Sheldon,Hold on. Nope no reason.
31402,Raj,Train day?
31403,Penny,Hey Sheldon.
31404,Sheldon,Well we have had some fun haven’t we?
31405,Raj,If you were standing behind me nagging I might.
31406,Penny,Yeah. Okay all right don’t freak out. You can make this work.
31407,Sheldon,Not so fast. You might want to hold off on lighting your rabeliechtli Penny.
31408,Sheldon,In the interest of science I’d be willing to.
31409,Leonard,I went to school for half my life. I have a doctorate. I’m still paying off college loans.
31410,Penny,Always nice talking to you Sheldon.
31411,Howard,And a cow and a penguin. Face it dude whether it’s a real car or a virtual cartoon car you can’t drive.
31412,Sheldon,Don’t try luring me in with sexy talk.
31413,Howard,Oh you’re welcome. Of course I couldn’t get you into the VIP section because you know that’s for VIPs and you guys are just you know Ps.
31414,Raj,Do you kind of look like a shiny Sheldon?
31415,Sheldon,You clearly weren’t listening to my topic sentence get your women in line! You make them apologize to Amy and set things right. I am a man of science not someone’s snuggle bunny!
31416,Sheldon,It’s about Amy.
31417,Penny,All right I’d like an order of fries.
31418,Howard,Well I mean yeah it freaked me out a little but that’s my issue not yours.
31420,Raj,You could try calling Triple-A but based on NASA’s latest timetable they won’t get there for 35 years.
31421,Leonard,Oh just you know moving a… time machine.
31422,Howard,At least now I can focus all my energies on just one girl.
31423,Howard,The Fantastic Four reunited.
31424,Leonard,What are you doing here?
31425,Howard,Yeah me too.
31426,Penny,Okay I’m starting to think Swiss is key here.
31427,Sheldon,Good night.
31428,Howard,Sorry. You’re right. I’m so stressed. But you know what whenever I walk into that temple I realize that whatever happens it’s okay. We’re all part of an immense pattern and though we can’t understand it we can be happy to know that it’s it’s working its will through us.
31429,Sheldon,You know how I know we’re not in The Matrix?
31430,Leonard,Well sleep tight.
31431,Penny,So how’s Amy?
31432,Penny,Well Leonard cooked for me and now we’re just having a nice dinner you know as a newly engaged couple.
31433,Penny,You can have soup delivered.
31434,Sheldon,Wow. Well marriage must agree with you. Well you are just glowing.
31435,Leonard,This is Sheldon’s mother Mary.
31436,Sheldon,Okay.
31437,Howard,Well then what are we going to do tonight?
31438,Leonard,We were going to have…
31439,Sheldon,No this is fun. Oh the thing about tomatoes and I think you’ll really enjoy this is they’re shelved with the vegetables but they’re technically a fruit.
31440,Penny,Yeah I hope you’re right.
31441,Leonard,Oh careful. That’s my original series Battlestar Galactica flight suit.
31443,Sheldon,Your lab is funded by some Middle-Eastern dilettante?
31444,Penny,I know. One of the tennis balls came off his walker and bounced right off his head. I mean I I almost wet myself. I guess you had to be there.
31445,Sheldon,Sure.  I’m Batman. See.
31446,Howard,I could go for some goat.
31447,Sheldon,Leonard Penny I just I want you both to know that I regret my actions toward the two of you. That’s a lie.
31448,Sheldon,Oh no. How could anybody hate Gino the Neutrino? It’s nice huh? I got him for 20 bucks on eBay. Including the shipping!
31449,Raj,Oh my God here he comes. This is it.
31450,Sheldon,Bring it home Mufasa. Eee eee eee eee eee um um-a-weh.
31451,Penny,Okay what’s up?
31452,Howard,How can she when you beat around the bush. She’s from the mean streets where they shoot from the hip and keep it real.
31453,Raj,Yeah Star Trek V worse than I.
31454,Sheldon,What are you going to do? Take people’s drink orders and get them wrong?
31455,Penny,Before I made that call my pig was alive and happy and rolling around in the mud. Now he’s illegally buried in our backyard next to my great-grandmother.
31456,Leonard,I wasn’t expecting such a crowd I’m a little nervous.
31457,Sheldon,Oh I’m not going to the funeral.
31458,Leonard,Which means I won’t be able to make Penny breakfast every day and she’ll realize my brioche French toast was the only thing keeping her in the marriage.
31459,Raj,Great. And?
31460,Sheldon,I’m struggling with the thought of leaving my old bedroom.
31461,Howard,I know. I mean do I open it? Do I return it?
31462,Penny,I don’t have a few minutes I’m running really late.
31463,Howard,Yeah sure. I understand. Yeah I’m very busy too.
31464,Howard,It was in the limo. They sent a limo. I have a limo. I just love saying limo. Here sip on this while you’re getting ready.
31465,Sheldon,How long have you been involved with him?
31466,Sheldon,For the record that kid was a terrible choice. If you cry when you drop your churro you do not have what it takes to rule England.
31467,Sheldon,One moment. Subject appears well-rested and enthusiastic. Apparently ignorance is bliss. All right let us begin. Where’s your notebook?
31468,Sheldon,What? Is this about Leonard and Amy? I don’t like it either.
31469,Sheldon,You think I can’t hear them? Listen to that. Stomp stomp stomp. That’s Wolowitz in his stacked heels that fool no one.
31470,Penny,In like two minutes. Yeah. So how is everything going around here? Are you still upset about people finding out you’re pregnant?
31471,Sheldon,I think you mean comic books. Comics are feeble attempts at humour featuring talking babies and anthropomorphized pets found traditionally in the optimistically named funny pages.
31472,Howard,I was on the radio once. I called in to Fever 104 FM New Delhi and was the fourth person to say the phrase that pays “Fever 104 आज के नये अच्छे संगीत का घर.” That means “Fever 104 home of the really good current music.” It’s much catchier in Hindi.
31473,Sheldon,Thank you for letting me stay here.
31474,Leonard,Oh yeah. We were meaning to do that.
31475,Sheldon,Well I must say I am impressed.
31476,Sheldon,But the only reason I was driving your car was because you were in distress and I was rescuing you.
31477,Leonard,Howard could I borrow some after shave?
31478,Penny,Look we can have a reasonable conversation and I won’t get mad. I don’t like it after sex and I don’t like it now.
31479,Raj,So I was thinking maybe we can come up with a name for the asteroid by combining our names.
31480,Sheldon,Would you like to talk about it? And keep in mind that no is a perfectly viable answer.
31481,Sheldon,Yes.
31482,Sheldon,Dr. Hofstadter.
31483,Penny,Mm.
31484,Howard,As I’m sure you’re aware the quickest way to a man’s heart is through his…
31485,Howard,But Daddy I I miss my family so much and with you and Mummy getting a divorce I feel sad and empty. Buying a little toy every now and then helps me fill that void. So while I can’t hug you every day flying that helicopter…
31486,Penny,Yeah I know it’s on Sheldon. Oh no no no no no. I cannot afford this right now.
31487,Howard,Thank you. Uh would you like to uh get a cup a cup of coffee or…?
31488,Sheldon,The way you put away those lemon bars perhaps that’s a good thing.
31489,Sheldon,Localized to what region?
31491,Sheldon,True. Sheldon’s Mine Simulation Log entry one. Koothrappali’s restating of the obvious is already getting on my nerves.
31492,Raj,Why so glum chum?
31493,Leonard,Nothing. Mother likes looking at brains and Sheldon likes getting his brain scanned.
31494,Sheldon,All right Mom. When you’re at the Ripley’s Believe It Or Not Museum if they have an exhibit about a mother who threw away a chance to spend the day with the world’s most wonderful son believe it because it’s true. 
31495,Sheldon,Brent Spiner?
31496,Sheldon,What well what’s wrong? Is she upsetting you? Because I can make her go away.
31497,Leonard,Hey.
31498,Leonard,It was fourteen fifty but it’s okay.
31499,Leonard,Where is everything?
31500,Sheldon,This deck is rigged in some fashion.
31501,Sheldon,Leonard where are the Skee-Ball tickets?
31502,Raj,I’m just asking dude. It happens.
31503,Sheldon,All right.
31504,Howard,Okay show of hands. Who’s up for this? 
31505,Howard,Does this place look familiar?
31506,Penny,You rat bastard.
31507,Leonard,Great. Maybe she can have sex with him and then walk out on him the next morning without so much as a how do you do?
31508,Leonard,Good point I’m in.
31509,Leonard,Yes. Do you know what that means? That means all of this attention that you hate goes away.
31510,Penny,Well he started it.
31511,Leonard,I answered every question Sheldon.
31512,Leonard,What?
31513,Howard,You’re not wrong about Fruit Stripe. I was always a Hubba Bubba man.
31514,Sheldon,Affirmative. Computer this is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Activate self-destruct sequence. Code 1-1-A-2-B.
31515,Sheldon,Don’t you need money?
31516,Leonard,No problem. 
31518,Sheldon,Gentlemen.
31519,Sheldon,They’re right it was the only option.
31520,Penny,You’re doing it again.
31521,Sheldon,A good question.
31522,Howard,I don’t know. Maybe it’s all those steroids I’ve been taking.
31523,Leonard,Pretty very there’s really no objective scale for delineating variations of good why do you ask?
31524,Howard,Congratulations.
31525,Leonard,I’m going too I’ll show you where it is.
31526,Howard,Why didn’t you say anything?
31527,Leonard,What?
31528,Leonard,Why not?
31529,Sheldon,Yes but the actual results are unsuccessful and I’ve already sent an e-mail to everyone at the university explaining that I have confirmed string theory and forever changed man’s understanding of the universe.
31530,Sheldon,Oh yes. Fig Newtons. I was going to ask them which scientist both helped to develop calculus and had a famous cookie named after him? And then after someone said Newton I was going to tell them they’re wrong. The cookies are named after a town in Massachusetts. And then I’d throw the cookies away.
31531,Leonard,Yeah.
31532,Penny,Screw it. I’m not gonna make a big deal out of this. It’s just dinner.
31533,Sheldon,First off that is axiomatically wrong because the best pudding is chocolate. Secondly the organic structure of tapioca makes it a jiggling bowl of potential death. It is extracted from the plant…
31534,Penny,Okay let’s just warm up on the run.
31535,Leonard,Oh Sheldon invoked Rosa Parks to make somebody who cut the line feel bad but only the white people felt bad.
31537,Leonard,I don’t know. You did it to me.
31539,Sheldon,I’m setting out snacks.
31540,Sheldon,Why are you asking me I have no information about your interactions with Penny other than what you provided me nor do I have any method of learning such things. 
31541,Howard,All right. I’ve made up my mind. I’m gonna do the right thing call this girl and let her know that I’m in a relationship.
31542,Sheldon,Yeah even that. You look like a dork.
31543,Sheldon,You’re right. It would never work. Amy finds you tedious.
31544,Raj,All right I will.
31545,Sheldon,You don’t get it do you? That’s a mockingbird. Mockingbirds can change their song which means he’s out of tune on purpose. He’s mocking me. Oh dear. There it is again. Do you feel it?
31546,Howard,Well we were just on our way to lunch and wanted to see if you’d like to join.
31548,Penny,I know that face. That’s your propose face.
31549,Howard,It was and I may have made it seem like a bigger deal than I should have.
31550,Sheldon,Really? Leonard wants me back?
31551,Sheldon,Anyway…
31552,Leonard,There’s not going to be a confrontation in fact I doubt if he can even spell confrontation.
31553,Penny,All right sweetie you’re paying for this table and it’s your apartment too.
31554,Howard,Dumped her? What did he use a forklift? Sorry. There’s nothing funny about morbid obesity.
31555,Sheldon,Are you sleeping?
31556,Sheldon,Uh suppose I’ll have to find and cultivate a new roommate. What a task that will be. Do you know how uncivilized Leonard was when I took him in?
31557,Raj,You’re not helping.
31558,Howard,I meant a Hindu temple.
31559,Raj,Fine. I’ll have a chocolate martini.
31560,Howard,Dude if we do this we’re gonna need a cool band name.
31561,Sheldon,Well I don’t enjoy presents. And the thought of people jumping out and yelling surprise fills me with more dread than the words George Lucas Director’s Cut.
31562,Penny,Hey.
31563,Howard,Not yet but her underwater photo shoot was an embarrassment.
31564,Penny,Okay. Look honey I promise there’s no one’s here. I‘ve had a long day. I just want to have a quiet dinner by myself.
31565,Leonard,This is easy. I didn’t need to wear a cup.
31566,Penny,Uh she’s enjoyed living with you. It’s called being in love.
31567,Penny,Oh the horror.
31568,Sheldon,Who listens to the radio any more?
31569,Penny,C’mon can’t we just open one up and take a…
31570,Penny,Okay well I have a date too so see ya.
31571,Sheldon,Excuse me Barry?
31572,Penny,We were just comparing notes about how you are in the sack.
31573,Sheldon,I know why. You’ve come to me because you’re my Obi-Wan.
31574,Howard,I need to rub my genitals on their prototype.
31575,Sheldon,I must say you’re playing very well for a woman of 23?
31576,Leonard,Wait that’s it? I thought we had a whole hour!
31577,Howard,That’s very offensive.
31578,Leonard,It wouldn’t be the worst thing if we were more active.
31579,Howard,Hi. Hi. Yeah it’s Raj. Rajesh. We met at the comic book store.
31581,Leonard,Okay fine. Live with cats. Be like my Aunt Nancy. She had dozens of them. And do you know what happened after she died? They ate her.
31582,Raj,You know when Cinnamon won’t take her medicine I hide it in a piece of cheese.
31583,Sheldon,Well I’ve been struggling for months to come up with a theory of dark matter that doesn’t make protons decay. I’m hoping to finally tackle it by optimising my work environment. See I’ve got uh my tea is at the perfect sipping temperature. Uh I have fleece-lined boxer shorts to keep my tushie toasty. And then oh last but not least this inspirational cat poster improved with the reassuring face of physics renegade Richard Feynman.
31584,Sheldon,Oh good. You’re here. I need your assistance.
31585,Howard,I don’t know it’s a marketing scheme. Please Sheldon I’m a young virile visitor from a foreign land and I need to strut my stuff.
31586,Leonard,Yes
31587,Penny,I want to but I don’t think I can.
31588,Sheldon,For the last time I am not having a tickle fight with you.
31589,Raj,Well seeing as its purpose was to piss you off I’d say it’s spot-on.
31590,Leonard,Well then bed mister.
31591,Sheldon,I wasn’t aware that lunar ranging was her thing. Although I suppose the retro-reflector left on the moon by Neil Armstrong does qualify as a shiny object.
31592,Penny,Really? You won’t even say A?
31593,Sheldon,Is there a “check the check engine light light”?  O-o-o-oh!
31594,Leonard,Okay. This is everything he had on the board. I’m sure we can figure the rest out.
31596,Leonard,It’s… you know time machine.
31597,Sheldon,Yeah It’s completely out of tune with the wind chimes.
31598,Penny,Is this usually how these physics things go?
31599,Sheldon,All right.  Go away. I agree it’s rude but she asked for privacy.
31600,Penny,You’ve had this dart board since I’ve known you but I’ve never seen you play.
31601,Sheldon,Ah it’s just like he’s here.
31602,Sheldon,Leonard you are my roommate my source of transportation and you help me fold my sheets when they come out of the dryer. You are safe.
31603,Penny,Yeah I saw those. They were funny. I printed a few out and put ’em on my fridge.
31604,Howard,Here you can have your seat.
31605,Penny,Yeah yeah I’ll be right there. Look Sheldon I have to go.
31606,Howard,Halfway is 600 miles off the coast of Japan.
31607,Sheldon,Oh. I thought it was a game.
31608,Penny,Yeah have fun.
31609,Penny,Oh yeah kind of. It’s it’s no big thing.
31610,Raj,Oh he’s really good with her.
31611,Sheldon,I can understand that. From the moment people realized I was a genius I’ve been Sheldon the Genius. Although I’ve never really wanted a break from that so I suppose I don’t understand. Which is ironic ’cause you know genius.
31612,Sheldon,Nothing.
31613,Leonard,You know he can’t take a trip like this by himself.
31614,Sheldon,Anyway um I realized that if we each present you with an account of what your father wrote to you only one of which is true and then we don’t tell you which one it is you will forever be in a state of epistemic ambivalence.
31615,Leonard,Hot dogs.
31617,Leonard,I guess for you that’s an option.
31618,Sheldon,You tramp.
31619,Sheldon,Okay uh number one in matters of physics I have the final say. In matters of neuroscience you have the final say. Unless I disagree. Oh here. Number two when we publish
31620,Leonard,Just nod and smile. He’s almost gone.
31621,Leonard,I’m pretty sure it’s already over.
31622,Leonard,Yeah.
31623,Penny,Yeah I’m gonna go pack a bag.
31624,Howard,Good night Sheldon.
31625,Raj,Okay. That hurts a little but okay.
31626,Leonard,She didn’t dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.
31627,Leonard,Yeah special like that.  That’s them. Please don’t make things any more awkward than they already are.
31628,Raj,And then went back to the home they share where they probably fell asleep in the matching pajamas she got them because they both just love penguins.
31629,Sheldon,Good morning gentlemen.
31630,Leonard,Relax it’s just a dirty sock.
31631,Penny,Of course I would I would be honoured.
31632,Penny,Okay good example.
31633,Sheldon,Your handwriting is impeccable.
31634,Penny,Oh come on it wasn’t me. Anyone could have knocked your mirror off or whatever happened.
31635,Raj,There’s got to be a smarter way of removing it.
31636,Sheldon,Well I’m not making any promises. Not only did Leonard take what I feel is an unnecessary risk he deceived me.
31637,Howard,What a baby.
31638,Penny,Oh my God. Hang it. Wow. Um you know I’d have to go get a hook and nails and a hammer and…
31639,Penny,Are you sure? I could pretend I’m a high school cheerleader who can’t control herself around esteemed alumni.
31640,Penny,Bored.
31641,Howard,Megan Pincus.
31642,Raj,It’s not a big thing. Just think of me as a brown Martha Stewart.
31643,Sheldon,I don’t see how you could.
31644,Sheldon,August 16th. Right after her carpal tunnel surgery.
31645,Sheldon,It’s midnight. Happy birthday.
31646,Sheldon,Because…
31647,Leonard,Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey. Mrs. Davis.
31648,Sheldon,I thought where you come from they don’t have emotions.
31649,Leonard,See now I’m confused. I mean what what am I supposed to do?
31650,Sheldon,And just to be clear only her baby and not these other people.
31651,Penny,Spider-Man. Get him Spider-Man.
31652,Sheldon,Oh dear Lord we’re doomed.
31653,Howard,Guys she’s my goddaughter I think I’ll know when I see her. That one.
31654,Penny,Ha-ha don’t push it.
31655,Sheldon,Oh dear. My mother warned me this is what happens to pretty boys in the big city.
31656,Leonard,Yeah don’t let Goofy near him. He’ll have nightmares and I’ll have to deal with it.
31657,Penny,His right hand is calling him?
31658,Leonard,Thanks for understanding sir.
31659,Leonard,Oh no it’s 630 in the morning.
31660,Howard,Okay new rule everybody only gets one. Uh next?
31661,Sheldon,I humiliated Stephen Hawking in a game of Words with Friends. He stopped playing and now we’re not friends anymore.
31662,Sheldon,Oh dear Lord a police officer’s glancing in our direction. We’ve been made.
31663,Howard,Great everyone’s a Byomkesh Bakshi. Now here are some secret facts about each of you including whether you are the murderer. Throughout the game feel free to ask each other questions to uncover clues.
31664,Leonard,Boy you take all the fun out of it for me.  But look Penny’s home. Why don’t we just call her have her go in the apartment get your flash drive and e-mail you the paper?
31665,Penny,Well I got you a little going away present.
31666,Sheldon,Oh that. Well see I wanted it and you weren’t using it. Apparently those are the rules we live by now. Payback it truly is the B word isn’t it?
31667,Sheldon,Formal protest.
31668,Leonard,You’re the one who invited him here.
31669,Penny,Come in.
31670,Sheldon,That’s not a problem we can figure this out. What are the reasons women reject Raj?
31671,Penny,No.
31672,Leonard,Forgive me for asking a stupid question but why are you being stupid?
31673,Raj,Okay. Well a couple of things. Don’t tell them I come from money. I want them to love me for me. They must be insanely hot. Like nines or tens.
31674,Sheldon,You mean you want me to keep a secret.
31675,Penny,Oh of course not. She wouldn’t do something like that. She’s deaf.
31676,Leonard,Does this sound familiar? I’d love to go shoe shopping with you. Hiking? It’s great. It’s two a.m. of course I want to go to Korea Town and sing karaoke with your friends. Who wouldn’t?
31677,Sheldon,Only do solid research? I come to you for help and you insult me? I thought the least that you would do would be…
31678,Leonard,No. I’m going to assert my dominance face to face.
31679,Penny,Actually I get what he’s saying.
31680,Leonard,What the hell? What’s the matter?
31681,Leonard,You’re right alcohol poor judgement it could go well.
31682,Sheldon,However the Spider-Man lyrics posit that Spider-Man Spider-Man does whatever a spider can.
31683,Sheldon,Oh. I thought we were just friends.
31684,Leonard,That should have been my first clue.
31685,Sheldon,I have spent my whole life trying to bring order to the universe by carefully planning every moment of every day. But all my efforts our dinner schedule my pyjama rotation my bowel movement spreadsheet it’s clear now I’ve been wasting my time.
31686,Sheldon,It’s not my friend. Nothing happened.
31687,Leonard,Alright  I just hit my head.
31688,Howard,Well it’s a lot better than having to wear noise-cancelling headphones in my own apartment.
31689,Howard,What are you doing?
31690,Sheldon,Oh of course come in.  This is an authentic Chinese throwing star and I must warn you I have seen many people throw them in movies.
31691,Howard,I don’t think so. She sounded pretty upset.
31693,Leonard,Why?
31694,Howard,Sheldon can suck on the Casimir Effect.
31695,Leonard,I’m not sure but I think I’m about to discover how the banana felt.
31696,Sheldon,I see. Did her abysmal housekeeping skills finally trump her perkiness?
31697,Howard,Not if it has a hole in the middle.
31698,Leonard,I didn’t skip it it’s just an anecdote. It’s not science.
31699,Sheldon,May I come in?
31700,Raj,Like this?
31701,Sheldon,It’s Oatmeal Day.
31702,Sheldon,Not much. Although I can be faulted for being overly fond of koala bears. I don’t know what it is when they smart munching on eucalyptus I just melt inside.
31703,Penny,Okay all I’m giving you is the napkin Sheldon.
31704,Sheldon,I am. Oh. Wait.
31705,Penny,You can only ask one question.
31706,Howard,I wouldn’t say she’s beautiful.
31708,Leonard,Great. Good. Great. What are you reading?
31709,Penny,Okay now this time…
31710,Penny,I had to; we’re married now.
31711,Howard,I don’t want to go to Flatland.
31712,Sheldon,Good ’cause I got you everything you need to make it. You are in for a treat. My mother’s fried chicken is why we had to buy my dad the extra large coffin.
31713,Leonard,Pukhpa.
31714,Penny,Give it a chance Sheldon you might actually like it.
31715,Sheldon,What are you doing here?
31716,Sheldon,Well now that I’ve piqued your interest welcome to the exciting world of 3D chess.
31717,Sheldon,FYI my noise-cancelling headphones proved ineffective last night.
31718,Raj,Since when do you go to spin class?
31719,Raj,Thank you but how do I know you’re not saying that just to be nice?
31720,Sheldon,No point. It’s just one of the things that makes one of the mes chuckle. What makes you chuckle Leonard?
31721,Leonard,What are we supposed to do now?
31722,Leonard,We don’t entertain much.
31723,Penny,Alright the cat’s alive let’s go to dinner.
31724,Penny,Come on smile. This is gonna be my Christmas card.
31725,Leonard,Oh boo-hoo. I spent four grand on a gift that only got rid of him for an afternoon. What is that?
31726,Penny,You know how come nobody’s talking about Howard’s dopey haircut?
31727,Howard,I wonder if this is what it feels like to be Bernadette’s baby.
31728,Raj,What is your mother going to say?
31729,Leonard,But the gibbon doesn’t know what it’s categorized as. It doesn’t even know it’s called a gibbon.
31730,Leonard,Why?
31731,Penny,I screwed up. Leonard’s a great guy. Never should have broken up with him.
31732,Sheldon,So I win.
31733,Penny,You know I got to tell you a lot of friends would let their friend go alone but that’s not who you are you are the kind of guy who stands by a friend when… when he has a symposium to go to.
31734,Penny,Well not as nuts as the guy who chooses to live with him.
31735,Leonard,Not right now Sheldon.
31736,Leonard,Okay and it’s perfectly okay to express those feelings right?
31737,Penny,Go away. Just go away.
31738,Leonard,Yes you are a super weaner.
31739,Leonard,You’re making eggs for breakfast?
31740,Leonard,Only ten hours 55 minutes to go.
31741,Sheldon,All right just warn me before you do it.
31742,Penny,Morning. What’s up?
31743,Sheldon,Aw man.
31744,Leonard,I just said why we don’t like her.
31746,Leonard,Best time of my life.
31747,Leonard,Mmm.
31748,Raj,Not much. Nuked a burrito. Prayed to the Hindu god Urvashi that your bowels would loosen and your penis would droop like a willow tree.
31749,Raj,That would be lovely. Thank you.  Mrs. Wolowitz uh are you okay?
31750,Leonard,I call Frodo!
31751,Sheldon,Wow. I anticipated we’d have problems but I never thought your scientific rigour would be one of them.
31752,Sheldon,Well if we’re going to descend into anarchy 
31753,Penny,Interesting. I’ll have to have you over for spaghetti some night.
31754,Leonard,No.
31755,Sheldon,I’d like to respond to that sarcastically. Yes I relish the thought of a stranger covering my body with oil and rubbing it.
31756,Leonard,Thank you for hiding my Star Wars socks at the emergency room. Is it a good time to evaluate the beta test and see where we stand?
31757,Leonard,I fell on the floor. All right he got you you can get him back.
31758,Howard,Maybe you don’t want someone exactly like you. You know what they say opposites attract.
31759,Raj,Material Girl needs ot be retired that is your karaoke song.
31760,Raj,Huh? That’ll come off.
31761,Raj,Hang on. Okay. Given the choice of anyone in the world whom would you want as a dinner guest?
31762,Raj,Boy when you met Bernadette the field of robotics really took a hit.
31763,Leonard,Well I can so shut up.
31764,Sheldon,I am fine. Here eat your toast.  Sorry.
31765,Raj,Come on Sheldon the world is filled with people doing things outside. Let’s go outside. Outside is good.
31766,Sheldon,Amazing Spider-Man Ultimate Spider-Man Spectacular Spider-Man The Marvelous Adventures of Spider-Man Spider-Man 2099?
31767,Penny,Forget it.
31768,Howard,You ever gonna tell him?
31769,Sheldon,I’ve worked up a bit of a sweat.
31770,Leonard,Why are you doing this?
31771,Leonard,Well are we just gonna sit here while they do the experiment?
31772,Leonard,So Rebecca how did you become a personal trainer?
31773,Sheldon,It is a marathon not a sprint.
31774,Sheldon,No don’t look to Him. He’s mad at you right now.
31775,Howard,So?
31776,Howard,You got me. Now what are you going to do with me?
31777,Sheldon,Why me? Why not Koothrappali or Wolowitz?
31778,Leonard,Well the new network name is ha ha ha now I’ve got you so it’s either Sheldon or Gargamel from The Smurfs.
31779,Leonard,It’s the least we can do.
31780,Leonard,Sit down we want to talk to you.
31781,Howard,It’s only a waste of money if we don’t play with them.  He’s right dawg.
31782,Leonard,Cos it’s not carved in stone.
31783,Penny,No Sheldon hurt you.
31784,Leonard,4am.
31785,Leonard,You’re kidding.
31786,Penny,In confidence!
31787,Leonard,Since when don’t you want to live with me?
31788,Leonard,I did like that he had the weather on it.
31790,Raj,Why? You writing a book?
31791,Raj,Well I try to. I certainly wouldn’t be a scientist if you hadn’t been my role model.  Who wants to go to Vegas in a real helicopter?
31792,Raj,No no speak up. I’m about to use the blender and I don’t want to miss anything.
31793,Sheldon,No. I came here to defeat Wil Wheaton the man who destroyed my dreams. But I can’t defeat Wil Wheaton the man who loved his mee-maw. Enchanted bunny.
31794,Sheldon,And I call her Meemaw because well just well look at her.
31795,Penny,Dare.
31796,Leonard,You can always get a badger and find out.
31797,Penny,What?
31798,Penny,Oh yeah. Yeah sure. So um Dave how do you know Leonard?
31799,Howard,Oh come on we’re in the telescope room. It’ll be like dining under the stars. You see this uh double zero? When it says zero one that means it’s twinkling. Sometimes it takes a while.
31800,Sheldon,I have a few questions. First I notice that you offer soup and a half-sandwich?
31801,Sheldon,I don’t want to play anymore.
31802,Sheldon,The same thing I’ve been doing for three days. Trying to figure out why electrons behave as if they have no mass when travelling through a graphene sheet.
31803,Leonard,Okay uh well I hope it’s fun. I mean it it comes with paints and and it’s kind of creative and artistic.
31804,Penny,Good morning.
31805,Howard,Yeah thank you! This means a lot to me. My friends are like my family. Unless you don’t like them in which case they’re dead to me.
31806,Sheldon,Oh my. That’s an uncomfortable topic. Amy before I met you I never had any interest in being intimate with anyone.
31807,Penny,Well it’s all good.
31808,Raj,Sorry I left them in my turban.
31809,Sheldon,Oh! It’s not even Easter time. This is crazy.
31810,Leonard,Hey you know what we should do?
31811,Penny,In a way. We’ve kind of been involved in a five-year experiment.
31812,Penny,I’ll let you hold my hair while I throw up.
31813,Leonard,I want you to know I get why you don’t want the money you’ve got this new job you’re excited about being financially independent and I am nothing but proud of you.
31814,Raj,I’m here to put the crib together.
31815,Raj,What’s that?
31816,Sheldon,Howard I think I can help here. Yes Bernadette that’s exactly what he thinks.
31818,Leonard,I’m sorry that must be very difficult for you.
31819,Leonard,You got it.
31821,Sheldon,Your heart might be in the right place but your head chest and arms certainly aren’t.
31822,Sheldon,Why? Is there someone else? Just couldn’t wait for that first notch on your bedpost could you?
31823,Penny,And if you really want to hurt him I look great in Chanel.
31824,Penny,Okay how is that?
31825,Penny,Yes it occurs to me too.
31826,Sheldon,And just like that you’re a Klingon-Sanskrit junkie.
31827,Penny,Well it’s not what I want to do.
31828,Sheldon,Well at least now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted smouldering wreckage that was once your fantasy of dating her and analyse the data so that you don’t crash into geek mountain again.
31829,Leonard,Right again. 
31830,Howard,Thank you. Thanks thanks. I’m sorry. I can’t do this. My my ex-girlfriend e-mailed me and I’m seeing her Saturday And I’m glad you like it it’s from J. Crew.
31831,Raj,Wool pants in the desert. I feel like I’ve got poached testicles.
31832,Howard,Hmm. Interesting. Did they take a walk down Liars’ Lane?
31833,Leonard,Is that so?
31834,Raj,Wait! Give me the number! Give me the number! Give me the number!
31835,Sheldon,Coming.
31836,Howard,Yeah okay whatever it takes to keep you busy for a few hours.
31837,Penny,I’m talking about other guys.
31838,Howard,Yeah well I know how to make your egg salad now.
31839,Raj,I broke up with her.
31840,Sheldon,I need a growth medium and someone polished off the apricot yoghurt. Here swab my throat.
31841,Howard,I I think he wants us to pull over.
31842,Sheldon,Did you know that I almost didn’t wear this shirt today?
31843,Sheldon,Uh roses bengay and Dr. Scholls’ foot powder.
31844,Penny,Come on boy. Come on. Let’s go. Let’s go. Get in the car. Come on.
31845,Leonard,I’d like to propose a toast to the man whose noble sacrifice inspired our victory Captain Sheldon Cooper.
31846,Howard,Okay just the candle thing.
31847,Howard,I’ll match it plus a thousand rupees.
31848,Penny,No not at all. No it’s it’s great. It’s terrific. I you know I just can’t help feel bad about Sheldon. I mean how’s he going to get by without you? Ernie.
31849,Penny,You know I paid a lot for this. Let’s take it over there and show him.
31850,Leonard,Morning.
31851,Sheldon,Thank you.
31852,Penny,Okay sweetie I don’t know if we’re gonna have cookies or he’s just gonna say hi or really what’s gonna happen so just let me talk and we’ll…
31853,Sheldon,Oh Tesla.
31854,Penny,What did he say?
31855,Raj,Hey.
31856,Howard,But when you’re insecure no amount of external validation can ever make you feel safe.
31857,Leonard,All right.
31858,Leonard,Yeah I’m a frickin’ genius.
31859,Howard,Well I would never leave you off my list and not just because without you we’re playing fast and loose with the word list.
31860,Sheldon,Well thirty thirty five hey when did your mother go into menopause?
31861,Penny,I’m not hooking Wolowitz up with one of my friends.
31862,Leonard,Yeah.
31863,Penny,Don’t talk just drink.
31864,Penny,What exactly do you think goes on here?
31866,Sheldon,April 12th 2005 Bob’s Big Boy Toluca Lake. Raj had just introduced us to Priya for the first time and she was enjoying the sweet taste of Hindu rebellion in the form of a Bob’s Super Big Boy hamburger. In order to preserve your friendship you and Howard made a pinky swear that neither of you would attempt to woo her. I had a patty melt.
31867,Howard,I have a thick accent. You don’t know what I said.
31868,Leonard,Okay.
31869,Sheldon,I’ve got a brand-new seven piece set of polyhedral dice. Hello new dice smell.
31870,Penny,Okay well. Guess we’d better get started.
31871,Penny,But is Sheldon really believing all this crap?
31872,Leonard,No.
31873,Sheldon,Very well I’m sure I can find something that will help you ditch that itch.
31874,Penny,You’re not curious who she’s out with?
31875,Leonard,Sure.
31876,Leonard,Thanks for the steak Wyatt.
31877,Penny,Really? That’s how you’re gonna spend your Saturday night?
31878,Leonard,He wants to talk about Penny. I don’t want to talk about Penny.
31879,Leonard,Can we please have some privacy?
31881,Leonard,Why me?
31882,Leonard,I don’t know anything about show business so if you think it’s reasonable to turn down paid work and just burn through your savings I’m sure you know what you’re doing.
31883,Sheldon,No he would be exactly the same.
31884,Penny,There you go quesadilla salad there’s your pizza and thanks to Sheldon’s heated discussion with my manager one barbecue bacon cheeseburger barbecue sauce bacon and cheese on the side.
31885,Sheldon,That’s Northwest Texas I’m from East Texas the Gulf region home to many Vietnamese shrimpers.
31887,Raj,Okay so Saturday night can I count on my posse?
31888,Sheldon,It smells wonderful. Is anyone slaving away in the kitchen? Because I too know…
31889,Sheldon,What I want is to be departing the Starship Enterprise in a one-man shuttle craft headed to the planetoid I rule known as Sheldon Alpha Five.
31890,Penny,Have fun guys.
31891,Howard,That isn’t Klingon it’s Yiddish for meat-filled dumpling.
31892,Penny,That’s ridiculous.
31893,Leonard,So Mother what’s new?
31894,Sheldon,Okay. By the way you have something on your shirt.
31895,Raj,Hmm. Uh let me see something. 
31896,Raj,What’s it thinking about now?
31897,Sheldon,Yes you must be present to win.
31898,Penny,No I was there that day. Sheldon threw his back out handing him that book.
31899,Howard,Are you crying?
31900,Leonard,Asthma heart some kind of attack. I’m fine though.
31901,Penny,Oh no no no no. I’m not flabbergasted. I’m puzzled. Yeah let’s go with puzzled.
31902,Sheldon,Well I never told you about my brother’s kidney stone. You want to hear about everything that comes out of my family’s genitals?
31903,Leonard,The Harmony One was fine. We didn’t need to upgrade to the eleven hundred which he knows is too big for my hand.
31904,Sheldon,Thank you. Would you go tell everyone else that? Because they sure think otherwise.
31905,Leonard,Well this is it this is it. This is it.
31906,Sheldon,Well we sure saw that coming.
31907,Penny,What’s up?
31908,Howard,Why is that great news?
31910,Sheldon,Is it morning?
31911,Leonard,Oh that one doesn’t apply to you. You sit.
31912,Sheldon,Alcohol? I don’t drink alcohol.
31913,Leonard,No no it’s okay. It’s really thoughtful.
31914,Penny,Yeah well you should have quit ’cause I’m still gonna beat your ass.
31915,Howard,I really don’t get your problem with birds.
31916,Howard,Okay yes I will err on the side of caution and defrost a fresh batch.
31917,Sheldon, Leonard.
31918,Penny,Well do you know anybody?
31920,Sheldon,Mr. Data’s weapon is his mind. I’m wielding it.
31921,Leonard,So we already have you for all that.
31922,Howard,Oh we could play filk music.
31923,Penny,That’s okay.
31924,Sheldon,All right I think I have enough to go on. Possible explanations for your symptoms are in descending order of likelihood hyperthyroidism premature menopause hosting an alien parasite or and I only include it for the sake of covering absolutely all bases sexual arousal.
31925,Sheldon,Oh oh please if I don’t know you don’t know. That’s axiomatic.
31926,Sheldon,Yeahuh look it is scientifically impossible for a person to tip a cow. Even you with your stocky build and lumberjack shoulders you couldn’t do it.
31927,Sheldon,And that made you feel sad?
31928,Raj,As you wish.
31929,Penny,Oh.
31930,Leonard,So when the aliens brought you back they just left the probe in?
31931,Howard,Oh pause it. That’s it. Confirmed. We now have the address of the top model house.
31932,Sheldon,Look at you getting me to engage in the social sciences. You’re a vixen Amy Farrah Fowler.
31933,Sheldon,Then it’s settled. Amy’s birthday present will be my genitals.
31934,Raj,Tell her it doesn’t matter. Tell her her eyes shimmer like opalescent lilies in the lake of the palace of the celestial maidens.
31935,Sheldon,Okay. Well what do you do?
31936,Leonard,Well you should talk to Stuart.
31937,Raj,Actually you’re all just gonna be yourselves.
31938,Sheldon,Ignore them Amy. They’re just jealous because they’ll never have a relationship as good as ours.
31939,Leonard,It was not a crisis. Apparently I favoured the left one she got a little lopsided.
31940,Penny,Hey they have wine here don’t they?
31941,Leonard,Have you noticed that Howard can take any topic and use it to remind you that he went to space?
31942,Leonard,Sheldon do you really expect to enforce this?
31943,Howard,Or is Sherlock Holmes the English Byomkesh Bakshi?
31944,Leonard,Thank you. There’s lox and cream cheese in the fridge the bagels are in the oven I was warming them up.
31945,Raj,If you need a green hand why not just use the Hulk?
31946,Sheldon,Very well. Cooper to Enterprise one to beam up. Energise.  Ah. Tiny Spock. Help.
31947,Leonard,I mean it I’m going to.
31948,Howard,We can’t send him back to North Korea. He knows how to get out.
31949,Penny,No.
31950,Sheldon,He owns Fox and they cancelled Firefly. Hint he and Darth Vader are tied for number 2.
31951,Sheldon,There’s always one. She gave it to my sister about her boyfriend my brother about his girlfriend my father about his girlfriend. That one had some un-Christian words in it.
31952,Leonard,Okay I’m hanging up now. You know there’s no such thing as a k… 
31953,Raj,No.
31955,Leonard,Sheldon you need to work in the morning.
31956,Sheldon,Gentlemen please. Leonard is trying to walk a mile in my metaphorical shoes. He can’t walk in my actual shoes. He has the feet of a toddler.
31957,Raj,Yes. Indeed. Absolutely. Indubitably. I’m not even sure what the last one means but it’s another word and I know it. So uh when do you want to meet up?
31959,Leonard,You’re right this side does look better.
31960,Sheldon,Your name is Bernatrix. You are a warrior queen. You’re strong beautiful and tall.
31961,Penny, Sheldon.
31962,Howard,You get to choose between a mountain bike or a PS3.
31963,Leonard,Is it? We’re together all the time. Financially it makes great sense. Can you think of one reason why we shouldn’t do this?
31964,Howard,Okay okay that-that came out wrong but you have to admit you all had a wonderful time.
31965,Leonard,If I stand I’ll vomit.
31966,Leonard,Priya’s in town?
31967,Leonard,Of course not. She’s she’s just a very sweet and God-fearing lady and you have to be respectful of her beliefs.
31968,Sheldon,You’re back.
31969,Penny,No. I’m not wearing it. It looks stupid.
31970,Penny,You were home alone and had no one to play with?
31971,Howard,I’m here to put the crib together.
31972,Sheldon,Leonard has a lady over.
31973,Leonard,If you’re wondering why I’ve been staring through the peephole I’m trying to get a look at this guy who’s coming over to Penny’s.
31974,Sheldon,Aw…
31975,Penny,I want a divorce.
31976,Howard,Uh my plans with Priya.
31977,Howard,I think you’re both cute.
31978,Raj,Maybe there’s a way to get them to come up with it.
31979,Sheldon,Actually as part of the application I was required to make a short video answering that very question. You want to see it?
31980,Raj,Hey look the new Warlords of Ka’a expansion pack is out.
31981,Penny,What’s wrong with you? you’re freaking me out.
31982,Leonard,Hey. Just playing a little Giant Jenga here.
31983,Sheldon,Still hasn’t bought milk even though I told him two days ago.
31984,Penny,Oh.
31985,Raj,And right here.
31986,Leonard,I played that pretty well. 
31987,Sheldon,I’m going to buy her a present.
31988,Leonard,Why would I be interested? I have Penny.
31989,Penny,And you’re gonna be here for a couple more.
31990,Leonard,I don’t know I got all confused when you said honestly.
31991,Penny,What?
31992,Sheldon,Can you break a twenty?
31993,Sheldon,Oh I do like monkeys!
31994,Leonard,Well yeah.
31995,Penny,So do you know who’s in there?
31996,Sheldon,See?
31997,Howard,Well if Wil Wheaton and Stuart win their match and we beat lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants in the next round we’ll face off for the championship.
31998,Penny,Damn you’re sneaky.
31999,Sheldon,Put it on the back burner. Anyway it occurs to me if I ever did perfect a time machine I’d just go into the past and give it to myself thus eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place.
32000,Penny,Okay that’s enough. Stop talking.
32001,Howard,Uh what number in line are you?
32002,Raj,Do you ever do anything for anyone else?
32003,Leonard,No I don’t want any chocolate! Sheldon you can’t train my girlfriend like a lab rat.
32004,Sheldon,What is your problem?
32005,Penny,No I’m serious. Look I’ve always had these plans. I was gonna be in movies and live this glamorous life and anything less than that just wasn’t worth getting excited about.
32006,Leonard,Because…. uh Friday we are attending a symposium on molecular positronium.
32007,Penny,What did you do?
32008,Penny,It’s a little loud.
32009,Howard,Mmm I know the feeling. It’s like accidentally walking into a gay bar and then having no one hit on you. It-It happened to a friend of mine.
32010,Sheldon,Please look at this porcelain skin. I’m like a human sink.
32011,Penny,Um well I’m from Nebraska. So what can you tell me about the state flag?
32012,Raj,Really? So every other place you’ve been you thought this was fine?
32013,Raj,Check it! Howard pulls one out from under the bridge. Nice!
32014,Raj,Actually I’m single now.
32016,Penny,Not the first one I’ve made today.
32017,Sheldon,It’s okay I stopped being upset about that. And no the irony is not lost on me.
32018,Penny,Oh of course. The annual birthday booty spectacular!
32019,Howard,And then some. I think we had a moment.
32020,Penny,No be friends. You and me.
32021,Sheldon,Yes it is delicious. Physicist baker lover what can’t I do?
32022,Sheldon,Algorithm. You see Penny Alan Turing defined an algorithm…
32023,Raj,As I’m sure you’re aware the quickest way to a man’s heart is through his…
32024,Penny,Sheldon have you ever considered not rushing into something new? I mean why don’t you take your time enjoy your freedom? Maybe something new to study will find you.
32025,Penny,Oh hey if we hurry we can make the new Jennifer Aniston movie.
32026,Penny,Yep. ‘Cause I’m gonna be dead.
32027,Penny,I know my dad wanted a boy. I just I tried being good at sports but I hated getting dirty!
32028,Raj,Not so loud but ideally yes. Thanks.
32029,Penny,Go.
32030,Howard,Oh yeah we hang out all the time.
32031,Leonard,Hey.
32032,Raj,Well you’re all thinking it I’m the only one who hasn’t done anything worthwhile.
32033,Sheldon,My last physical.
32034,Howard,We hit a couple of bumps. She lives over on Manhattan Beach so it takes over an hour to get there. And she’s a lesbian.
32035,Howard,Also uh cherries?
32036,Sheldon,That is my desk chair that is where I work. I don’t eat in my desk chair and I don’t work in my spot. I work in my desk chair and eat in my spot.
32037,Penny,Oh come on. Look if the roles were reversed he’d be on the first train to New Jersey or the second train if there were teenagers on the first one.
32038,Howard,My turn!
32039,Sheldon,Okay well now that we have the terminology straightened out. How dare you.
32040,Leonard,Fine. Why did you have dinner with Penny?
32041,Leonard,It’s kind of a big deal.
32042,Howard,Are you sure? He’s tall pale and awkward. That sounds like your type.
32044,Sheldon,There is no abort.
32045,Raj,Maybe we’re too smart. So smart it’s offputting.
32046,Leonard,So you’re a little behind on your bills. Everybody gets behind on their bills.
32047,Sheldon,I don’t care for novelty editions of Monopoly. I prefer the classics regular and Klingon.
32048,Leonard,So you’re gonna throw me under the bus?
32049,Sheldon,Oh yes like the male peacock with brilliant plumage or the rutting baboon with engorged hindquarters.
32050,Howard,I don’t think this kind of wrestling has a bell.
32051,Raj,Good morning. Is there some new kind of casual Friday I don’t know about?
32052,Leonard,No problem.
32053,Penny,Yeah. You got a problem with that?
32054,Raj,More than we can use. You see in India we don’t make the mistake of letting our poor people have dreams.
32055,Penny,I was 16 in Nebraska. What do you think?
32056,Penny,Okay.
32057,Raj,In case you didn’t follow that I’m the coffee.
32058,Leonard,So?
32059,Sheldon,I’ll pay you 40 dollars.
32060,Sheldon,Okay. I think this will be my seat.
32061,Leonard,Mrs. Cooper we say Catholics not rosary rattlers.
32062,Sheldon,Correction. Missy can date whoever she wants.
32063,Howard,No thank you. I’m fine.
32064,Penny,I turn into a bear?
32065,Leonard,No!
32066,Penny,Really?
32067,Sheldon,I don’t know. A music-loving hobo with a heart of gold?
32068,Howard,Ah well in this context… 
32069,Penny,Okay where is he going?
32070,Howard,No wait the evening’s not over.
32071,Sheldon,I think we should see other people.
32072,Sheldon,That’s mighty sassy for a man with a roommate performance review around the corner.
32073,Leonard,No not at all. Let me help you with this stuff.
32074,Leonard,Terrific.
32075,Sheldon,Of course I can’t mention you in my Nobel acceptance speech but when I get round to writing my memoirs you can expect a very effusive footnote and perhaps a signed copy.
32076,Penny,No problem. Um so listen I don’t know if you have any plans next weekend but I kind of promised your mom we’d have another wedding ceremony so she could attend this time.
32077,Sheldon,Well my new shoes are not made for running.
32078,Leonard,Easy easy  Okay! Now we’ve got an inclined plane. The force required to lift is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs call it thirty degrees so about half.
32079,Leonard,Okay I’ll go. Never have I ever been arrested.
32080,Penny,Oh thank you.
32081,Leonard,No.
32082,Raj,So I did a little research on what the conditions are like in the mines and the guys might be right sounds pretty rough down there. For starters it’s very humid and about a hundred degrees.
32083,Penny,Oh thank you and I’m sorry I lied about it.
32084,Penny,Oh no. Why?
32085,Leonard,Baby.
32086,Penny,Oh. Wow. Okay. Let’s see. We’ve got uh milk chocolate Swiss cheese fondue. My lactose-intolerant boyfriend is going to eat all this then I’m going to climb on his back and rocket to the moon?
32087,Penny,Yeah go ahead.
32088,Sheldon,Oh five more minutes.
32089,Leonard,It’s this Jimmy Speckerman thing. I can’t decide if I should agree to see him or not. Of course that might be because the last time I ran into him he made me floss with my own shoelaces.
32090,Penny,So hey I was thinking about that stuff with Alex.
32091,Leonard,You want to watch Battlestar?
32092,Raj,Uh I’d say by three.
32093,Penny,Yeah okay I think this ends the ex-boyfriend portion of our evening.
32094,Sheldon,Very well. Hey Comic-Con tickets go on sale this Friday. You can’t buy one.
32095,Leonard,No. But it does involve air travel. Okay um let me slice this Swiss cheese with my Swiss army knife and then you can wash it down with a cup of Swiss Miss instant cocoa.
32096,Leonard,Yeah. Did you notice all the people looking at us?
32097,Howard,Well I think we should show what earthlings look like.
32098,Raj,Guys have you seen Stuart all up in Penny’s business over there?
32099,Penny,Oh I’m so sorry I’m such a mess and on top of everything else I’m all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesn’t even work.
32100,Sheldon,Oh Penny. I know you think you’re being generous but the foundation of gift-giving is reciprocity. You haven’t given me a gift you’ve given me an obligation.
32101,Howard,You know this reminds me of high school.
32102,Raj,You might want to slow down a bit buddy.
32103,Penny,Oh my God. Yes. Why would you even ask that?
32104,Penny,Get out here! Your mommy wants to talk to you!
32105,Penny,Sheldon you are a smart guy you must know…
32106,Raj,Did you start waxing?
32107,Penny,Who are you kidding? You were so panicked Leonard was gonna die you’ll never leave him.
32108,Leonard,That’ll be all. That was fun.
32109,Sheldon,I need to see it. While I’m gone don’t breathe on my pillow.
32110,Raj,How about that guy? He looks like he’d hate you.
32111,Leonard,Did you guys have an argument?
32112,Penny,What now you’re interested? You didn’t even want to come.
32113,Howard,My my. The plot like my gravy thickens.
32114,Sheldon,Wouldn’t you like to know?
32115,Leonard,How are we going to get it upstairs?
32116,Howard,Oh please. I don’t remember the episode of Star Trek where the guy never goes to space and brags about it in a tuxedo store.
32117,Raj,Really?
32118,Leonard,I suppose. I do miss whistling though.
32119,Penny,You know she’s my mother-in-law. Why can’t I bond with her like that?
32120,Leonard,I stopped counting at four.
32121,Leonard,Penny this is Raj’s sister Priya.
32122,Leonard,Absolutely.  Oh bite me!
32123,Sheldon,Oh Lord will this day never end? As I’ve explained repeatedly to Dr. Koothrappali whose ability to comprehend the American idiom fails him when it’s convenient there’s absolutely no money in my budget for additional office furniture.
32124,Penny,No I know I got that. Yeah totally.
32125,Penny,Mmm these are so good
32126,Sheldon,I can’t believe I read this table wrong. I blame you.
32127,Leonard,Good to know.
32128,Raj,That is one tough birdie.
32129,Penny,Yeah. I’m tapping out. Leonard?
32130,Leonard,I’m not talking to you like you’re an idiot! I’m saying the whole idea is idiotic!
32131,Leonard,I wonder if we’d have to disclose something like this when we apply for grants.
32132,Howard,Oh come on. You deserve one. You’ve worked hard to find a woman who makes a lot of money.
32133,Sheldon,My mother would lock her car doors if she had to drive through this hodgepodge of ethnicity.
32134,Penny,Yeah beam me up. I love it.
32135,Sheldon,I don’t want the next level. I like this level. Fix it for me!
32136,Howard,Hello.
32137,Leonard,Because he’s hard to find. If he was easy to find the books would be called There’s Waldo.
32138,Sheldon,Maybe this isn’t a good time.
32139,Penny,Oh am I talking too much? I’m sorry. Zip.
32140,Sheldon,If that happens don’t make me wait ten years to watch you eat a tin can.
32141,Leonard,No it doesn’t.
32142,Leonard,If it helps I’m questioning your life choices too.
32143,Howard,I am making her comfortable. Besides she’s not sleeping here half the time anyway.
32144,Howard,Oh. Very clever. But still racist.
32145,Penny,No.
32146,Leonard,Hello? They gave me a Band-Aid. Hospitals do not issue Band-Aids unless it is medically necessary. That is the law.
32147,Raj,Hey.
32148,Raj,So you’d do a striptease?
32149,Howard,Thank you but cute is for bunnies. I want to be something with sex appeal like like a labradoodle.
32150,Penny,Yeah I like hanging out with you guys.
32151,Sheldon,All right. Can I help you?
32152,Leonard,Buddy I don’t think you can. I mean once it’s out there it’s out there. This thing is like the science equivalent of a sex tape.
32153,Sheldon,Well I’d give more examples but well everyone in your position’s so forgettable.
32154,Sheldon,No. Isaac goes at the top of the tree.
32155,Sheldon,Oh that’s a paradox. I mean if you meant what you just said then that means you may not have meant what you just said.
32156,Penny,You know what I mean. And you know maybe the way I’ve been reacting was me sabotaging this too.
32157,Howard,It’s very simple. For breakfast she has an egg-white frittata. Feel free to give her a choice of home fries or an English muffin but not both. We’re watching our weight. Uh for dinner something simple a veal chop some scampi whatever you like.
32158,Sheldon,Before I answer was he a smoker? I think you’re looking at this all wrong.
32159,Raj,No. But it’s a stupid test.
32160,Sheldon,Damn this is hard. 
32161,Leonard,I don’t need any insights. I just want to know why Penny’s more interested in Stuart than me. We’re practically the same guy.
32162,Leonard,I don’t care.
32164,Raj,Hey Sheldon you busy?
32165,Raj,I think you made that very clear.
32166,Sheldon,You know I can’t keep a secret.
32167,Howard,I don’t want to celebrate.
32168,Raj,Will do.
32169,Raj,Oh what’s so gothic about vodka and cranberry juice?
32170,Leonard,Uh I kind of told her I was working.
32171,Penny,Really oh yay!
32173,Leonard,Sorry Raj my mind is made up.
32174,Sheldon,It’s okay.
32175,Leonard,Don’t.
32176,Leonard,Okay partner let’s do it.
32177,Leonard,Uh listen I heard that Bernadette’s thinking about asking you for a pre-nup.
32178,Sheldon,Yeah except for the fact that Indiana Jones is completely irrelevant to the story. With or without him the Nazis find the ark open it and die.
32180,Sheldon,Excuse me but I think we’ve both found that helpful at times.
32181,Leonard,Uh-huh.
32182,Penny,Say yes.
32183,Penny,What are you guys gonna do?
32184,Leonard,Yeah I’m sorry too. We’re about to share the rest of our lives together. It’s our money who cares who has it?
32185,Leonard,Okay I have pokh.
32186,Sheldon,Howard is a complete and total ass Bernadette is in Penny’s bed Amy bites and Penny may or may not have coitus with Leonard.
32187,Sheldon,Do you realise I may have to share a Nobel Prize with your booty call?
32188,Howard,That’s fine. She and I can cry together.
32189,Penny,Hey. Is everyone getting to know each other?
32190,Howard,Oh quick sit.
32191,Penny,Really?
32192,Leonard,Sheldon. We are dealing with an impossible deadline from the Air Force because of you. So have an energy drink don’t have an energy drink. Order suppositories and shove ’em wherever you want I don’t care.
32193,Howard,Or we could talk to this guy he used to share an office with.
32194,Penny,Ugh what can you do? Here. 
32195,Raj,That was pretty badass dude.
32196,Leonard,Hi.
32197,Leonard,So you’re upset about missing out on becoming some sort of freakish self-aware robot?
32198,Leonard,I don’t have epilepsy either.
32199,Howard,Please come in.
32200,Penny,Hey what you doing Quick Draw?
32201,Leonard,But it is what you got me last year.
32202,Sheldon,I’m sorry no.
32203,Sheldon,I enjoy marching bands and Tibetan throat singing.
32204,Penny,Yeah you guys run to the store and let the women handle the science for a change.
32205,Penny,Unless you want to be Cinderella.
32206,Sheldon,I realize it’s irrational but with Raj moving in there I’m feeling a bit replaced.
32207,Sheldon,Who’s killing the mood now?
32208,Howard,That’s incredible. Oh here break out the math.
32209,Leonard,Laura.
32210,Sheldon,Boy oh boy. This vacation is off to a wonderful start. The smell of formaldehyde the whir of the centrifuge the distant chatter of lab animals being dispatched for dissection. Mm I can already feel my cares just melting away.
32211,Sheldon,How can you be sure? VHS was king when Feynman drove this van. For all we know there are hidden compartments lousy with Jane Fonda workout videos.
32212,Raj,Oh I was hoping for a juicy tidbit about Ron Perlman’s testicles.
32213,Sheldon,I’d love to but I don’t have tangerine chicken.
32214,Leonard,I don’t believe it.
32215,Penny,Okay I’ll talk to her later. Uh Dad there’s something I need to tell you. Leonard and I got married.
32216,Leonard,Oh we could run a pattern-matching algorithm against well-known unsolved physics problems.
32217,Sheldon,Good morning Amy.
32218,Leonard,See you guys at work.
32219,Leonard,Wait a minute what are you talking about? What inappropriate behaviour?
32220,Howard,Of course. What?
32221,Raj,Peering through his telescope at the birth of the cosmos.
32222,Raj,Holy crap!
32224,Penny,Good for you.
32225,Sheldon,I suppose I should set this up. Or would you like to rob me of that too?
32226,Sheldon,Really? Did you just have the Nobel Prize in waitressing stolen from you?
32227,Leonard,Listen I’m sorry about all of Sheldon’s interruptions he can be a bit of an eccentric.
32228,Penny,Yeah why?
32229,Penny,It was a long story. Anyway Sheldon I promise I know what I’m doing. Please let me cut your hair.
32230,Leonard,Good one.
32231,Penny,Leonard you are really not cheering me up.
32232,Leonard,Nothing really. It was just kissing.
32233,Raj,Oh. Mine was Winnie the Pooh. But anyway why don’t we just take a step back and start with a colour? Right? There are so many amazing ones. Red blue green purple.
32234,Raj,Okay.
32235,Leonard,You know what? I am ending this. Penny didn’t want to hold the ring anymore. She gave it to me I have it. I’m sending it back. Where’s the ring?
32236,Leonard,Why would you buy peppermint schnapps?
32237,Howard,I don’t know if I want to play anymore.
32238,Leonard,Fine. If I don’t meet someone soon you can put me in a home.
32239,Leonard,Well I can’t believe you’d say that. You know how insecure I am about my insecurities.
32240,Penny,Oh fine. You know it’s been a while. I’m getting back out there.
32241,Sheldon,Hi. Hello. Oh and a special hello to Leonard who needs to be mentioned by name.
32242,Leonard,Howard what do you think?
32243,Penny,Thank you Leonard. What’s my share?
32244,Leonard,I didn’t have clams.
32245,Leonard,I got your back.
32246,Leonard,What did I ever do to Jimmy Mullins in the third grade? He still punched me in the face with my own fists. Sorry you little nerd you were just in the wrong boys’ room at the wrong time.
32247,Leonard,Penny got it.
32248,Penny,Okay feeling the awkward now.
32249,Sheldon,Fine I’ll do it in English but it loses something. The need to find another human being to share one’s life with has always puzzled me. Maybe because I’m so interesting all by myself. With that being said may you find as much happiness with each other as I find on my own. The Klingon would have made you cry.
32250,Sheldon,It’s very simple. Look scissors cuts paper. Paper covers rock. Rock crushes lizard. Lizard poisons Spock. Spock smashes scissors. Scissors decapitates lizard. Lizard eats paper. Paper disproves Spock. Spock vaporizes rock. And as it always has rock crushes scissors.
32251,Sheldon,GPS says we’ll be at the railway in three hours.
32252,Sheldon,Yes first we have to decide if those lost six minutes will be coming out of game time bathroom time or the pizza break.
32254,Penny,Want some mac and cheese?
32255,Leonard,Why would you do that?
32256,Sheldon,Talk to the hand.
32257,Leonard,Because I’ve been busy because I haven’t figured out a way to bring it up and mostly and I can’t stress how key this is because I don’t want to.
32258,Sheldon,No. I’ve reached my breaking point. I need to leave. Now.
32259,Sheldon,Equally ridiculous. Let’s go.
32260,Leonard,I know what he looks like.
32261,Penny,Or I don’t cut it and maybe just style it a little.
32262,Leonard,Good night Wyatt. Oh good night honey.
32263,Sheldon,Howard can I ask you a question?
32264,Howard,Oh. If I had one it would be Brown Dynamite.
32265,Penny,Ugh we’re the last ones here hurry up.
32266,Penny,So how’d it go?
32267,Howard,Your words fall like acid rain on the wounded petals of my heart.
32268,Leonard,What was I supposed to do? He needed a place to sleep it off.
32269,Sheldon,No Penny don’t give up you can get this.
32270,Sheldon,Yes.
32271,Raj,Well I couldn’t have done it without my two favourite girls. Martha Stewart and Rachael Ray.
32272,Howard,Okay so it’s a it’s a David and Goliath story. It’s about man against God. It’s called Hammer and Whip The Untold Story of Thor versus Indiana Jones.
32273,Sheldon,Like a gladiator!
32274,Penny,Hey guys.
32275,Sheldon,I was thinking specifically of the gentleman over there moving his lips as he enjoys the latest exploits of Betty and Veronica.
32276,Raj,an we change the subject? Spiders give me the jeebie-jeebies.
32277,Sheldon,That’s because it’s simple.
32278,Penny,Yeah sure of course I love him.
32279,Sheldon,You didn’t read the bio did you? He’s not just a middle child he’s the quintessential middle child from a broken home to boot. Psychologically speaking the attention he gets by rebelling even to the point of self-destruction is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab.
32280,Howard,What makes them think they’re always in charge of everything?
32281,Raj,All right.  Who do we have here?
32282,Penny,Okay I don’t want this to turn into a fight.
32283,Sheldon,Gentlemen is anybody interested in my old string theory books?
32284,Raj,Oh. Well then I anticipate an awkward situation when you get home.
32285,Penny,All right this is making me crazy. Somebody’s got to go over there.
32286,Howard,Nope. Gates gave a speech at the university. Sheldon went up to him afterwards and said maybe if you weren’t so distracted by sick children in Africa you could have put a little more thought into Windows Vista.”
32287,Sheldon,I’ll have a diet coke.
32288,Sheldon,Ah then your meal choice is appropriate. Starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit available for violent expulsion.
32289,Sheldon,She was late. And she found atomic spectroscopy boring. Well I wouldn’t coitus her with your genitals.
32290,Penny,Leo you are a very sweet really funny guy. You’re gonna do okay.
32291,Penny,Don’t take advice from a man who threw his shoe at a crow.
32292,Raj,That’ll do it.
32293,Sheldon, Leonard and Penny!
32294,Leonard,Really? In front of your sister?
32295,Sheldon,I’ll be happy to check the math but numbers don’t lie Penny. In any event now that Amy and I have spent quality time together I feel much more confident proceeding to the next stage of our relationship.
32296,Sheldon,It was like a grapefruit.
32297,Raj,She’s kind of a mean drunk but what are you gonna do?
32298,Raj,Wait. What the hell is ding?
32299,Howard,No you don’t get it. I want nothing to do with any woman. My heart is stone. From now on I’m a monk. I renounce all worldly pleasures. Except for lobster. And garlic butter.
32300,Raj,I’m not done but thank you.  I think back to all the good times we had like uh when we went camping and spent that night telling each other all our secrets. I told him I’m addicted to pedicures and he told me he lost his virginity to his cousin.
32301,Howard,Okay you got me there but you’re wrong about this!
32302,Sheldon,I am not leaving until I’m done.
32303,Sheldon,Oh good my turn. Well this is very exciting and I wanted you to be among the first to know…
32304,Leonard,Just sit somewhere else.
32305,Penny,Oh I’m just doing this awful workout. I hate it.
32306,Leonard,Stay calm we don’t know anything about them yet. What are you doing?
32307,Penny,Damn you you rat bastard.
32308,Raj,Okey dokey let’s roll. Alright it’s time to raise the roof. Oo-ooh oo-ooh.
32309,Sheldon,Hmm. Oh who cares?
32310,Howard,Are you sure? That doesn’t sound right.
32311,Sheldon,Come on take me to work with you.
32312,Leonard,Great.
32313,Raj,Yeah you’ll love it. Ain’t no party like a Koothra-party.
32314,Sheldon,The dragon’s Christopher Walken. That’s perfect.
32315,Raj,Mmm gentlemen I put it to you the worst tapioca pudding is better than the best pudding of any other flavour.
32316,Penny,Really? Would it be totally weird if I used it?
32317,Leonard,You’ll have nerds fawning all over you. If you don’t love that this marriage is in trouble.
32318,Sheldon,This chair is squeaky. Now do I fix it or get a new one?
32319,Penny,What?
32320,Penny,Wait wait wait. What are these changes on page six?
32321,Sheldon,That would probably save us some time.
32322,Raj,Hang on I’m not saying that his feelings aren’t crazy. I just don’t want him to think that this isn’t a safe place.
32323,Sheldon,Yes.
32324,Leonard,What’s the matter?
32325,Leonard,You don’t know his girlfriend very well.
32326,Howard,Yeah well I like you a lot and that’s scary for me. Mostly because you’re a proven flight risk.
32327,Howard,Cool. I’ll make the popcorn.
32328,Sheldon,It’s a possibility.
32329,Howard,Oh yeah think about it. We’d hang out we’d read comic books we’d see movies. It’d be like the best relationship ever.
32330,Penny,I’m sorry this is rude of me. I will go get that water. See see see see. Just now you expressed your feelings to my face. How come you could do that with me but not Raj?
32331,Penny,I don’t know maybe teach acting.  Oh sorry. Hold on. Hello?
32332,Howard,Spoiler alert! Spoiler alert.
32333,Raj,Well I like to think I take mostly after you. Anyway speaking of Daddy I had a very strange conversation with him. He said he couldn’t afford to send me money any more because of his active social life.
32335,Penny,Better. You’re the lint trap of my love.
32336,Penny,Let’s try open.
32337,Raj,Uh-huh.
32338,Leonard,What are we drinking now?
32339,Sheldon,Hey Leonard.
32340,Penny,Hmm he’s not crazy about needles but if you get him to go jogging it’ll just pour out of his nose.
32341,Leonard,That would be great.
32342,Leonard,Oh come on. Not that book. It it’s got like every horrible story from my childhood in it.
32343,Leonard,Good. Slow.
32344,Leonard,Uh six.
32346,Leonard,Ooh flowers and chocolates? Somebody’s trying to get me out of my panties.
32347,Penny,You know so does Leonard. Can’t I just get ready in the morning without him giving me his goofy thumbs-up? Hey-hey-hey.
32348,Raj,You know I just read a study that suggests new mothers are better at sensing emotions for up to two years.
32349,Penny,Okay look it’s not my fault that she thought you were a bad boyfriend.
32350,Penny,Oh my God! Is that sweater made of bees? Come on take it off. I won’t tell.
32351,Howard,So?
32352,Leonard,You never stop talking do you?
32353,Sheldon,Well this calls for an expression of gratitude.
32354,Leonard,It was going well. I was showing this super hot girl how to boot up in Safe Mode. The manager got suspicious and well long story short they really do have a little jail in the mall.
32355,Raj,I’m sorry guys. Sheldon was upset Leonard and Penny were fighting I just wanted to go some place where I wasn’t causing problems.
32356,Sheldon,Um…
32357,Raj,There’s no reason to worry.
32359,Sheldon,So you’re attempting to pinpoint where consciousness resides in the brain.
32360,Howard,Why are you on a diet?
32361,Sheldon,To this day I’ve never touched Stuart.
32362,Sheldon,Not necessarily. This is a classic example of munchausen’s trilemma. Either the reason is predicated on a series of sub-reasons leading to an infinite regression or it tracks back to arbitrary axiomatic statements or it’s ultimately circular i.e. I’m moving out because I’m moving out.
32364,Sheldon,Yeah you had a good run Fake Wolowitz. We’ll remember you with nostalgic fondness the way we do the dial-up modem the VHS tape or or Leonard’s gym membership.
32365,Sheldon,You don’t know the half of it. It was billed as a lively give-and-take on the merits of model train sizes. But it was actually a set-up to intimidate weak-minded spineless rubes into buying H-O starter sets.
32366,Sheldon,You mean you want me to keep a secret.
32367,Sheldon,I take issue with the word compulsive.
32368,Sheldon,Right now somewhere a woman is dividing the atomic weight of the best noble gas by the number of colours in the oldest national flag still in use.
32369,Raj,I couldn’t find you guys so I bought six new friends. Three sadly are dead.
32370,Penny,Just says anyone in the world. I guess that means living.
32371,Leonard,Ah I also made oatmeal.
32373,Leonard,Well I want to watch it now.
32374,Raj,Uh well she’s single so if somebody else asks her out and she says yes then we know she’s not into Sheldon.
32375,Sheldon,I have.
32376,Leonard,Are you okay?
32377,Penny,M-hmm.
32378,Raj,It’s true. I’m always attracted to women I can’t have. I do it all the time. I did the same thing with the two of you.
32379,Penny,To get sex.
32380,Howard,Hey show her the trunk. Show her the trunk.
32381,Leonard,Okay well this time it’s going to be different. Because I am like a romance ninja. You don’t see it coming and then bam romance watch out hearts kisses love ooh-ya!
32382,Penny,Leonard?
32383,Penny,Sheldon what took you so long?
32384,Howard,He’s been fascinated with dinosaurs lately. Maybe we could get him a fossil.
32385,Sheldon,It’s been three days. Why hasn’t Stephen Hawking played a word?
32386,Howard,Nope I think mocking you is more fun.
32387,Penny,Oh hi. What’s up?
32388,Penny,You just said yourself it’s sad.
32389,Howard,And what does forty-three mean?
32390,Sheldon,Why would I gamble? It’s mine. Let go.
32391,Sheldon,All right. Come in. You look positively orange with loneliness. No I don’t see that catching on at all.
32392,Leonard,Yeah and they can all move in with you and your mother the current Mrs. Wolowitz.
32393,Howard,I think you’d be pleased to hear that this morning in the parking garage I saw this oil stain on the ground that was shaped just like my ex-girlfriend Lucy and I didn’t get upset at all.
32394,Penny,Ugh. Leonard?
32395,Leonard,This isn’t so bad.
32396,Sheldon,Oh. How much does it cost to get them off my lap?
32398,Leonard,Almost.
32399,Leonard,You don’t think it’s worthwhile to try to get more women working in science.
32400,Penny,You know to be fair we did get married in Vegas and didn’t invite her.
32401,Sheldon,Well our friend Raj moved into my old room and it’s brought up a lot of negative feelings for me.
32402,Penny,Hang on.
32403,Leonard,Oh great.
32404,Penny,Hey since when do you do laundry on a Thursday?
32405,Howard,And if you’re not in the mood for coffee I can always make you a Chai Tea-3PO.
32406,Penny,What are you talking about?
32407,Howard,Philadelphia. Okay now I get it.
32408,Leonard,This is bad.
32409,Howard,Hang on. Building on what Leonard said no one built on what I said.
32410,Penny,I know right? Maybe I should just move back to Nebraska.
32411,Raj,I don’t understand.
32412,Howard,Howard’s capsule should be re-entering the atmosphere any minute.
32413,Raj,Wait wait. Sheldon stop being crazy for a second. How much is something like this worth?
32414,Leonard,I’m over it.
32415,Sheldon,And thanks to you I know better than to ask if you’re menstruating. And based on your behaviour I don’t have to.
32416,Howard,Okay. So in the last 20 minutes we’ve seen a crazy woman kissing a fetus in a jar. We’ve seen a guy cut in half and sewn to a fish.
32417,Raj,That’s the only logical inference.
32418,Sheldon,Well of course they’re movies. Were you expecting me to come up with an example involving a real life time machine? That’s absurd.
32419,Sheldon,What twelve year old boy wants a motorised dirt bike?
32420,Sheldon,I never kid about safety.
32421,Sheldon,No. We are committing genetic fraud. There’s no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high IQ offspring think about that. I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.
32422,Howard,Uh it wasn’t anything weird. It was just to see how big they were.
32423,Sheldon,Well what if you did it gradually?
32424,Penny,Is Raj out with Emily again?
32425,Sheldon,Don’t listen to him he’s still light headed from all the Irish whiskey and pickled eggs in his system.
32426,Sheldon,Of course.
32427,Leonard,Satisfied?
32428,Leonard,Poor guy. He must have been exhausted. Sheldon like to sleep while Leonard play the bongo!
32429,Penny,Well we don’t really have to pretend.
32430,Penny,Aw that’s sad.
32431,Leonard,I think Penny has a point. You can see it another day.
32432,Penny,Oh my God you’re about to jibber-jabber about jibber-jabber.
32433,Sheldon,Excuse me. Starting to watch a television show that might run for years isn’t a decision to take lightly. I’m wrestling with a big commitment issue here.
32434,Leonard,What the hell? How long has she been here?
32435,Howard,But a cannon? Am I really out of the game?
32436,Raj,I thought it was funny.
32438,Penny,Peppermint schnapps.
32439,Howard,All the more shame that will fall upon the house of Hofstadter.
32440,Sheldon,Penny I have an eidetic memory. Also that’s a picture of you in the passenger seat holding your dislocated shoulder.
32441,Sheldon,Would you rather I offer my personal insight?
32442,Sheldon,Oh. Oh in that case it was pretty good.
32443,Leonard,Thirty feet.
32444,Sheldon,It’s not a present it’s the present. Look. There’s you and me. There’s Penny and Amy. We’re playing Pictionary. In the present.
32445,Sheldon,If you’re looking for an example of a waste of time I would refer you to the conversation we’re having right now.
32446,Leonard,You’re not squirting her in the face with water.
32447,Sheldon,Old enough to know better. You know and now that I think about it I stood in front of a case of iPods and I bought a Zune.
32448,Raj,Dude I’m an astrophysicist. If there were solar flares I’d be all up in it.
32449,Sheldon,Take it take it.
32450,Penny,Sheldon what is wrong with you?
32453,Sheldon,And I’m glad you and I are friends again too.
32454,Sheldon,I’m transcending the situation. I’m clearly too evolved for driving.
32455,Leonard,Son of a bitch. Why is that funny?
32456,Howard,Yeah yeah. Sure. What’s up?
32457,Raj,Sheldon you have two choices. Either you let him put a bigger hard drive in the TiVo or you delete stuff before we go out of town.
32458,Raj,Sure of course. Oh actually Emily was gonna spend the night.
32459,Penny,Oh my God I screwed up everything. I hurt Leonard I hurt Raj I mean what is wrong with me? I feel like two totally different people Dr. Jekyll and Mrs. Whore.
32460,Sheldon,Really?
32461,Howard,Call you right back.
32462,Raj,I can’t date two women at once. Zero women that’s my sweet spot.
32463,Leonard,Well I just I thought…
32464,Penny,Ugh that’s what I was trying to avoid.
32465,Howard,Oh I have an idea.
32466,Sheldon,But I didn’t use it because it didn’t seem safe. Despite all my e-mails the toilet didn’t have a seatbelt.
32467,Sheldon,Yes but I was eleven.
32468,Howard,Hi.
32469,Leonard,This is ridiculous.
32471,Leonard,Yeah.
32472,Sheldon,Yes yes. What did you decide?
32473,Sheldon,Hello.
32474,Penny,Not really clear on what he does.
32475,Howard,Amy I’m really sorry. I didn’t mean to upset you.
32476,Howard,Yeah me too.
32477,Penny,Uh-oh.
32478,Penny,Um can you give me a hint?
32479,Penny,Well ’cause they’re not genius scientists.
32480,Howard,I just never want to be a burden on my friends.
32481,Sheldon,I’ve seen pictures of your mother keep eating.
32482,Howard,Holy crap! Look!
32483,Penny,So why did you finally tell me?
32484,Howard,Wha… You’re kidding!
32485,Leonard,I say this one time instead of wimping out let’s be badasses.
32486,Raj,I will take that action.
32487,Sheldon,He’s not gonna make it.
32488,Leonard,You guys are making me nervous.
32489,Leonard,Sheldon I’m warning you I can play this game too.
32490,Leonard,It could be.
32491,Penny,What are you gonna do about your bully? Are you gonna see him?
32492,Sheldon,All right.
32493,Raj,Okay I’m good.
32494,Howard,Is there a window around here we don’t know about?
32495,Penny,Okay while they get the cake Sheldon I just want to say I hope you didn’t think you were gonna get through tonight without a hug.
32496,Sheldon,Well I don’t like it.
32498,Sheldon,I believe this is an extension of the death metaphor. The cold breeze is the so-called ectoplasmic issue of a disembodied soul passing by.
32499,Penny,You’re closer to 40 than you are 30.
32500,Sheldon,Are you sure? You said that with the testy bark of an old biddy.
32501,Sheldon,There anything I can get for you? Some apple juice? Uh some Jell-O?
32502,Penny,Great. I hope I’m a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory for my whole life.
32503,Leonard,Amy?
32504,Penny,Oh thank you but maybe I should cancel.
32505,Penny,Well I ran into him last week and he was…  just all apologetic about how he’s changed he was just going on and on and I believed him and I’m an idiot because I always believe guys like that and… I can’t go back to my party because he’s there and I know you don’t want to hear this and I’m upset and I’m really drunk and I just want to… 
32506,Sheldon,Well last night Amy was angry with me because I’d been foolishly telling people about certain personal matters.
32507,Leonard,Can I take a look?
32508,Penny,Wait wait hold on back up. You’re having a woman stay with you?
32509,Howard,What the hell did I do?
32510,Sheldon,Now let’s follow in that brave woman’s footsteps and stand up for ourselves. And and I realize that she stood up by remaining seated but now is not the time to enjoy the irony of that. Now I ask you again. Who here takes issue with this person…
32511,Sheldon,I need access to the Cheesecake Factory’s walk-in freezer.
32512,Leonard,Uh-huh. It’ll last forever. I preserved it in a one percent solution of polyvinyl acetal resin.
32513,Penny,Whoa that’s kind of a big step for a guy who only recently agreed to take his socks off.
32514,Sheldon,Oh I’m glad you like it. Raj picked it out.
32515,Sheldon,I realized something. When Amy was in my life I was hyper-focused on my work and ignored her.
32516,Leonard,Zazzles?
32517,Howard,Wait doesn’t anyone have a rod of resurrection? Because if you’ve got one I need it bad. Get in here with your rod and give it to me.
32518,Penny,Um I play a customer in a diner and I flirt with Mark Harmon.
32519,Leonard,No that doesn’t sound right either.
32520,Raj,Please come in.
32521,Raj,Sheldon listen to me. I have a big decision to make and I’m scared.
32522,Sheldon,Well there was a misbegotten adventure with a waitress who lives across the hall. It ended as inexplicably as it began. They had very little in common except for carnal activity. That’s why I acquired these noise-cancelling headphones. If you decide to use them please clean the ear pieces afterwards with the Wet Wipes you’ll find in the bathroom. They’re in the drawer labelled Wet Wipes.
32523,Penny,Oh Leonard honey if we started living together I wouldn’t be able to keep my hands off you.
32524,Sheldon,Perhaps I’ll spend some time developing a unified theory of comedy which will allow me to elicit laughter from anyone at any time. Unless they’re German ’cause that’s a tough crowd.
32525,Leonard,She meant Emily.
32526,Raj,Hey guys. Mind if Emily joins us for lunch?
32527,Sheldon,Sheldon Cooper does not do cozy.
32528,Penny,Red Leader I’m really sorry.
32529,Leonard,Oh that’s just the tip of the sadness iceberg.
32530,Penny,Hang on. You know what? You have been a jerk about this all day. You always do this whenever I mess up you’re right there to make me feel even worse about it.
32531,Leonard,So if you don’t like this Christie why are you letting her stay?
32532,Raj,Well uh as your friend you might like to know that um we didn’t have sex in the conventional sense.
32533,Sheldon,Well I’m open to that.
32534,Sheldon,Are you pointing out that California is a community property state and since Howard and Bernadette are married the intellectual property contained in that letter is jointly owned by the two spouses?
32535,Raj,Thanks for coming with me.
32537,Sheldon,I’d be happy to create a chart and participate in a differential diagnosis.
32538,Leonard,Thank you Amy. Very touching. Howard and Bernadette you are lucky enough to be best friends who love each other. And that’s the strongest kind of love because at its core it has kindness patience and respect. Qualities that are hard to find in people these days.
32539,Leonard,En el acelerador de particulares.
32540,Howard,Well I don’t.
32541,Sheldon,If by holy smokes you mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men’s room at MIT sure.
32542,Penny,Yeah and she keeps trying to figure out if our cycles have synced up so we can call ourselves the Three Menstra-teers
32543,Leonard,What do you guys think I should do?
32544,Leonard,What are you talking about the date went fine.
32545,Sheldon,Dr. Leonard Hofstadter you are officially charged with two violations of the roommate agreement. Do you waive reading of the charges?
32546,Penny,So do you want to come?
32547,Sheldon,Oh great now she’s jumping up and down on the bed.
32548,Penny,It’s so cute and rustic up here.
32549,Leonard,I guess it depends on the zombies Raj. Are we talking slow zombies fast zombies? Like in 28 Days if those zombies didn’t eat they starved.
32550,Howard,I’d love that but she’s not really comfortable around people.
32551,Sheldon,Yeah but he’s dumb and his face is dumb.
32552,Sheldon,Well then at least hold her still so I can pretend she’s stuffed. Raj I let my emotions get the best of me and I unfairly took it out on you.
32553,Sheldon,Can I get this comic book too?
32554,Penny,Your picture’s on my refrigerator.
32555,Sheldon,Here come the waterworks.
32556,Leonard,So what happens next?
32557,Leonard,Can we get an order of dumplings but with three instead of four.
32558,Penny,Great and just so you know I’m not getting rid of all your stuff.
32559,Leonard,Yep.
32560,Sheldon,What on earth are you talking about? My behaviour in the cafeteria was delightful. Maybe your friend Gunderson needs to head over to IKEA and assemble a sense of humour.
32561,Raj,You know what’s a great app? The one that makes fart noises.
32562,Raj,Oh by the way can I borrow your bullwhip and fedora?
32563,Sheldon,Goodbye peasants.
32564,Penny,Hi.
32565,Leonard,I am leaving.
32566,Sheldon,Raj you were being a good friend and my illness was no excuse for my behaviour. I hope that you can accept my apology.
32567,Penny,Well I care. I mean look if we’re gonna do this why not try and make it something we’re actually proud of?
32568,Howard,Well you’re kidding right?
32569,Sheldon,Arthur Jeffries was a scientist. I’m sure he didn’t care about silly superstitions like funerals. You know if he were here I think he’d say enjoy Star Wars Day.
32570,Leonard,Ah hey Leslie.
32571,Sheldon,is he deliberately blowing smoke at me?
32572,Leonard,Honey?
32573,Penny,I just love decorating the Christmas tree. It makes me feel like a little girl again.
32574,Leonard,Hey Stuart have you seen Sheldon?
32575,Penny,Okay this is definitely the most fun thing we can do with the money.
32576,Raj,I know that. But to be fair I’ve spent nine months helping Bernadette get ready for this baby and Howard spent five minutes conceiving it. And I’m being generous.
32577,Howard,Oh that sounds lovely.
32578,Leonard,No. Sheldon why didn’t you tell me?
32579,Sheldon,I think a birthday party is a terrible idea. I envy Leonard for growing up without that anguish.
32580,Raj,I saw what you did there.
32581,Sheldon,Pneumococcus streptococcus staphylococcus and other assorted coccuses.
32582,Leonard,So you’re not judging me?
32583,Leonard,You’re up.
32584,Raj,Don’t be like that. Come on Howard talk to him.
32585,Penny,Oh hey Sheldon. What you got there? A new comic book?
32586,Raj,You can do it.
32587,Penny,Okay look we don’t have to go anywhere. We can just you know stay here and hang out in the hot tub.
32588,Sheldon,Me too! Most people don’t see it. What are you reading?
32589,Penny,Okay I don’t think Amy wants a pocket watch.
32590,Sheldon,Look I appreciate the effort but I’m still unclear how this trip is supposed to be enjoyable for me.
32591,Howard,Yes.
32592,Leonard,Oh what the hell.
32593,Penny,Okay.
32594,Sheldon,Oh I learned how. Amy taught me.
32595,Penny,Yeah yeah you get to buy toys and little clothes.
32596,Leonard,Oh hey Stuart. This is Penny. She’s looking for some comic books.
32597,Leonard,You made the bed? You really are pulling out all the stops.
32598,Sheldon,Hmm. . This is pretty sharp.
32599,Howard,It’s not a big deal. It just took like five minutes to set up.
32600,Leonard,Yes.
32601,Leonard,Well what am I supposed to do?
32602,Penny,Nice to meet you.
32603,Sheldon,Um…
32604,Raj,Way to bust out the Jedi mind tricks dude.
32605,Raj,Aren’t you gonna eat lunch?
32606,Howard,Well I want to make sure we get invited to all the parades.
32607,Penny,Your glasses?
32608,Penny,Not even when you were a kid?
32609,Howard,Hey what’s going on?
32610,Sheldon,Thank you.
32611,Howard,Yeah before the movie you did 20 minutes on why guacamole turns brown. It turned brown while you were talking.
32612,Leonard,Thank you Sheldon.
32613,Raj,Be there bright and early.
32614,Leonard,Oh I can take it slow. Did I ever tell you about my first girlfriend in high school Karen Berberick? To this day she doesn’t know we were going out. Made it easier on her when I broke things off.
32615,Raj,You have a thing of paper clips right there.
32616,Howard,Actually I was just checking my e-mail. But uh no the Rover is not responding.
32617,Sheldon,Oh I can take a look at it.
32618,Leonard,That’s true.
32619,Leonard,Come on don’t look so sad. You never know what’s gonna happen. Maybe tonight will be great.
32620,Penny,No stop being stupid.
32621,Penny,Oh just a video of Bernadette in a beauty pageant.
32622,Sheldon,Or maybe you have a stick up your prefrontal cortex.
32623,Penny,No just crazy. Sheldon what are you doing here?
32624,Penny,Give me back my key.
32625,Sheldon,In general would you say that you smell better worse or the same as you do right now?
32626,Leonard,I just can’t figure out what happened. I put my left leg in I took my left leg out I put my left leg in and something just snapped.
32627,Penny,Okay if Leonard has so many problems with me why hasn’t he just said so?
32628,Leonard,My father’s not texting me back.
32629,Raj,Okay I’m good.
32630,Sheldon,It was tornado season. And it was an aluminium house. Anyway the housekeeper in the faculty residence didn’t speak any English when I finally managed to convince her I was sick she said “Möchtest Du eine Darmspülung?”
32631,Leonard,No reason. I was just talking to Raj and he mentioned what a lovely glow she has these days.
32632,Raj,Yeah it’s pretty great.
32633,Raj,Stu the cockatoo?
32634,Leonard,You’re right.
32635,Raj,And that’s not even the best part. See? I have one too. Check it out. You can wear yours and we can have little sword fights whenever we want.
32636,Sheldon,You know what they say? Revenge is a dish best served nude.
32637,Leonard,If the past is any indication no.
32638,Raj,Oh no don’t put me in the middle of this. I’m not going to be your go-between.
32640,Howard,Okay uh anybody else? Huh? No? Okay it all comes down to me the best man. Ooh! This grasshopper is kicking my ass-hopper. Okay when I first came to this country I-I didn’t know how to behave or how to dress or what was cool I was pretty lonely. But then I met Howard and suddenly my life changed because we could be lonely together. This man became my whole world.
32642,Leonard,I gotta say I am really impressed. This is truly the Sheldon Cooper way to get even. 
32643,Raj,Hang on. Building on what Leonard said no one built on what I said.
32644,Raj,I have three brothers and two sisters Sheldon I can do this all day.
32645,Penny,Thanks. Wow! What’s with the fancy spread?
32646,Leonard,One day. Right.
32647,Howard,Huh? That’ll come off.
32648,Sheldon,That’s a lot of belt buckles.
32649,Leonard,Golden Dragon.
32650,Howard,Come on. When you were on TV in Firefly you were actually in space.
32651,Penny,We are?
32652,Penny,Sheldon I can’t believe I’m saying this but I’m going to miss you.
32653,Penny,Well sorry I don’t know any dirty jokes.
32654,Sheldon,Alright that is very immature.
32655,Sheldon,All right I’m ready for my next question.
32656,Sheldon,Shoe sales hair styles mud masks gossip about your friends Brad and Angelina.
32657,Howard,That’s called a fashion choice.
32658,Leonard,Here’s your tea Mother. So what are you guys talking about?
32659,Penny,I can name tons.
32660,Sheldon,Well well well did you hear that Howard?
32661,Penny,Ah it’s nice having the place to ourselves isn’t it?
32662,Sheldon,Penny look. I appreciate your concern but I don’t think that’s what’s happening.
32663,Howard,You know there’s something I’ve always wondered about Aquaman.
32664,Leonard,I’m always excited for you. I’m excited that you found this new job where you’re making decent money.
32665,Howard,She has nothing to do with this. I am my own man.
32666,Raj,Well that’s what we wanted. This is as hot as the mines will be.
32667,Raj,Is that a real book? I would totally read that book.
32668,Penny,Okay. Wait right here.
32669,Sheldon,From the mind that brought you hi-lo. Let me show you to your room.
32671,Leonard,No it stands for Perpetual Motion Squad.
32672,Penny,That’s too loud.
32673,Raj,Aw I’m gonna miss you. Are you going with him?
32674,Penny,What the hell happened to lovely and charming?
32675,Leonard,It’s not a party. It’s the same group of people who hang out here hanging out over there.
32676,Leonard,So what do you say?
32677,Raj,Well we’ll just see how your noxious gas fares against my cinnamon-apple-scented aroma therapy candles.
32678,Leonard,What are you doing? He’s not a lost dog.
32679,Raj,It’s a potty. What do you call it?
32680,Raj,When was the last actual exercise you got?
32681,Sheldon,Trouble is my middle name Leonard. Actually it’s Lee but I prefer Trouble.
32682,Raj,Because she’s great in everything.
32683,Raj,I’m actually glad Lucy had to work tonight. Saved me the awkward conversation about how I was gonna be hanging with my bros.
32684,Leonard,No Jet Skis.
32685,Sheldon,Agreed.
32686,Raj,Yeah well I like you a lot and that’s scary for me. Mostly because you’re a proven flight risk.
32687,Raj,Huh what does that make us?
32688,Penny,What the hell? What? She’s not working late.
32689,Leonard,We’ll be there.
32690,Leonard,No I am he. Uh any anyway um there’s been something I’ve wanted to ask you for a long time. Um.
32691,Sheldon,I’m sorry.
32693,Leonard,No I don’t want to do it. You can do it.
32694,Penny,Ooh we should watch that next girls’ night.
32695,Sheldon,Those are Howard’s.
32696,Sheldon,Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Just because I love you doesn’t mean girls are allowed in my room.
32697,Leonard,Come on don’t be mad. It was a long time ago and it was an accident.
32698,Sheldon,Her research methodology is sloppy she’s unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity and to make matters worse she’s often mean to me.
32699,Penny,Oh great thing about Ernie was he never asked me for anything. He just gave.
32700,Leonard,Hey I was thinking if you want to do a couples costume we could paint ourselves green and be Hulk and She-Hulk. Or we could paint ourselves blue and go as Nightcrawler and Mystique.
32701,Howard,Thank you. I hope she’s half as lovely and amazing as you are.
32702,Penny,So ugly. What am I gonna do?
32703,Penny,So who do you have to schmooze to get this deal?
32704,Leonard,I’m turning it on but just to shut you up.
32705,Sheldon,Thinking caps on.
32706,Penny,Seriously none of you liked it?
32707,Raj,Oh that’s great. I’ve been wanting her to meet you guys too so this seems like the perfect opportunity.
32708,Howard,What’s this?
32709,Sheldon,Hardly.
32710,Leonard,It’s kinda cute until you get to the scrotum.
32711,Sheldon,That’s not correct. We were implying it. You then inferred it.
32712,Leonard,If you’re worried we can go over there and see if she’s all right.
32713,Raj,Oh we should have a plan in case one of us gets lucky.
32714,Howard,Like a business manager?
32715,Leonard,It’s nicer than anything he’s ever said to me. I’d take it and run.
32716,Sheldon,I wish you could all be inside my head. The conversation is sparkling.  Fine I’ll tell you. A lichen is an organism made up of two separate species fungi and algae. If you could merge with another species what species would you pick and why? Hint there is a right answer. None of you will get it.
32717,Penny,All right guys look I would love to go out but I’ve got to get this done okay? So have fun at the club. And if you get in trouble find a policeman. And if he’s taking off his pants he is not a real policeman.
32718,Leonard,Hey well see you. I’m going out. 
32719,Sheldon,She’s not my girlfriend. She’s a girl and she’s my friend but there’s no touching or unsanitary exchange of saliva.
32720,Penny,Look I get it I screwed up. Is this all we’re gonna talk about the rest of the day?
32721,Leonard,Hardly a day goes by when I don’t think about it.
32722,Penny,Yes.
32723,Leonard,Yeah?
32724,Penny,Hi.
32725,Leonard,We got a flat and couldn’t get the tyre off.
32726,Leonard,Sounds like you had a great night.
32727,Sheldon,Excuse me spoiler alert.
32728,Leonard,It’s weird. This must be how parents feel when their kid goes off to college. Unless they feel sad then it’s different.
32729,Howard,How about you decide this with Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?
32730,Penny,You had a lucky hunch.
32731,Howard,Well I ran a simulation that allowed me to correct for the observational efficiency.
32732,Leonard,If he were I wouldn’t be.
32733,Penny,Not since I found out the teddy bear you gave me had a webcam in it.
32735,Howard,I both hate you and want to be you. This is Ryan Gosling all over again.
32736,Leonard,Ah well what’s this? A pot of oatmeal? Or thanks to you what I will now call gloatmeal.
32737,Leonard,So don’t call her.
32738,Leonard,It would be like our World Of Warcraft a few years ago when the neighbours called the cops on us.
32739,Penny,Oh pl you’re not ruining it. Look at some point Raj will try to get everyone to do the Electric Slide. Now that will ruin it.
32740,Raj,No.
32741,Sheldon,Go ahead. That’s the only doctorate you’ll ever get. It smells funny in here.
32742,Leonard,Really? You figured out the graphene problem?
32743,Penny,Ah. Cool. Got any fun plans?
32744,Sheldon,Would you like to play a physics car game I invented called I Can’t Spy? It’s all the nail-biting tension of I Spy but the added fun of subatomic particles and waves outside the visible spectrum.
32745,Leonard,Sheldon we agreed we’d do something different tonight.
32746,Howard,Maybe we should post a comment back to our fan and thank him.
32747,Leonard,Actually it can be but I told you sex doesn’t count.
32748,Penny,He’s not dying.
32749,Raj,All right. Now what?
32750,Sheldon,Well aren’t you a peach.
32751,Sheldon,Well my mom used to give me sponge baths.
32752,Leonard,Okay this is getting a little hard to not take personally.
32753,Leonard,Cool. Oh look. That’s you having sex with a guy in the top half of a Chewbacca costume. Comic Con?
32754,Leonard,No thank you. I’m really not much of a dancer.
32755,Leonard,Now you’re just being ridiculous.
32756,Raj,It has been a while since I got my prostate checked.
32757,Sheldon,Is it because she’s dating you but was out with that other fellow?
32758,Leonard,Well it’s a lot smaller. It’s more about the comic books. The way these conventions used to be before they went all Hollywood.
32759,Penny,I’ve got a hot former fat girl with no self-esteem I’ve got a girl who punishes her father by sleeping around and an alcoholic who’s two tequila shots away from letting you wear her like a hat.
32760,Leonard,What?
32761,Leonard,I’ll go get Penny while that guy spits on our food.
32762,Raj,Plus this is where our minds are conditioned to focus on work.
32763,Sheldon,Alright I’m moving my infantry division augmented by a battalion of Orcs from Lord of the Rings we flank the Tennessee Volunteers and the North once again wins the Battle of Gettysburg.
32764,Howard,Well I was feeling bad about how I acted the other night so I made you a little something.
32765,Raj,I believe that’s the president of the university.
32766,Sheldon,Oh. Okay. You know I don’t want to criticise your rhetorical style but we’d be a lot further along in this conversation if you’d begun with that thought.
32767,Sheldon,What do you do?
32768,Penny,I haven’t been complaining that much about the movie. Have I?
32769,Howard,Groundbreaking revelations tropical drinks. Tell me this isn’t like the best episode of Sex and the City.
32771,Penny,I don’t know.
32772,Penny,Well Howard’s a complete and total ass Bernadette’s in my bed and no matter how much you stroke Amy’s hair she bites.
32773,Sheldon,If it is a crime to ensure that the universities resources are not being squandered chasing sub-atomic wild geese then I plead guilty.  Oh Penny!
32774,Leonard,So is that your team.
32775,Sheldon,You want me to remove him from the team? I’m the captain I can do that.
32776,Sheldon,Yeah good for you and don’t stop working on it.
32778,Penny,Yeah we feel awful.
32779,Leonard,Hey where’s Bernadette?
32780,Leonard,Buddy let it go.
32781,Leonard,It’s called proving a point.
32782,Sheldon,Gentlemen if I may interject I’ve decided my rank will be captain. If it’s good enough for Kirk Crunch and Kangaroo it’s good enough for me.
32783,Leonard,Yeah yeah great. Howard uh slow down. What do you mean it happened again?
32784,Sheldon,You’ve heard of French toast?
32785,Howard,What?
32786,Raj,Hey Leonard when you’re done we came up with a bunch more.
32787,Penny,Won’t make us any younger.
32788,Raj,This is the part where you talk.
32789,Penny,You have destroyed my ability to tolerate idiots. Now come with me.
32790,Penny,Fellas please.
32791,Leonard,That would be great.
32792,Howard,That’s funny because those aren’t the kind of kisses you want on your nipples.
32793,Sheldon,Gentlemen I have a question about dating and relationships.
32794,Sheldon,I think the same thing that appeals to people everywhere the dream of a cold rational world entirely without human emotion. Spock came from a planet governed only by logic. You know on Vulcan when your brother asks why are you hitting yourself? the answer is I’m not. You’re moving my arm. To which he says Fascinating. And then you both watch educational television.
32795,Howard,Hey we’re going to Oliver’s house to see his collection. You want to go with us?
32796,Sheldon,Oh I see was the apple falling on Newton’s head was that just an anecdote?
32797,Raj,Did that do anything?
32798,Penny,I don’t know what to do.
32799,Leonard,Wait! Penny! Take me with you! 
32800,Sheldon,Can’t we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger. The Big Boy.
32801,Sheldon,Sorry we’re late.
32802,Howard,What’s going on?
32803,Leonard,Only to shampoo Professor Chambourg’s shih tzu.
32804,Howard,Listen uh there’s something I want to talk to you about. I I wasn’t ready until now but I think it’s time.
32805,Sheldon,Raj’s television. I just realized we’re about to spend an evening watching a plasma screen with a cluster of dead pixels in the upper left-hand corner.
32806,Howard,Oh Penny I hurt so bad.
32807,Penny,No.
32808,Penny,Sheldon we’re a little busy here so…
32809,Leonard,Terrific. Great. What level is that?  Okay now you don’t remind me of my mom.
32810,Leonard,Oh there is no winning with you. And koalas and otters don’t even live near each other.
32811,Leonard,Sheldon!
32812,Sheldon,You had gelato with Stan Lee?
32813,Sheldon,It did not kill me when you went to space. Monkeys went to space.
32814,Penny,Oh I’m sorry.
32815,Leonard,I don’t know.
32816,Raj,And the worst sign of all is you’re here and not there.
32817,Howard,Ooh! Girls’ night girls’ night! Ooh! Ooh!
32818,Penny,I told you not to do the worm.
32819,Sheldon,It is awful isn’t it? Listen to that noise.
32820,Raj,Not my best first date. Yeah but not my worst either.
32821,Sheldon,Hang on. It’s a cardigan. I have to button it. Oh no.
32822,Leonard,Oh thanks.
32823,Sheldon,Wonderful. Although I’m not sure how I feel about being used as a guinea pig.
32824,Penny,Are you sure you don’t want to go to the emergency room?
32825,Penny,Look you said it yourself we have to create a database before you can write an alga-thingy.
32826,Penny,All right. Now you don’t want to cut too deep into its guts or the blood will just squirt all over your face.  Oh my God. What is with you guys?
32827,Leonard,I think someone owes me an apology.
32828,Leonard,Yeah you didn’t lose anyone when you met Amy. Yeah well no this study refers to romantic partners. Not the way I would categorize the two of us.
32829,Sheldon,Absolutely not. Yeah Penny you spent some time in front of the camera. Any words of advice?
32830,Penny,Yeah. Oh. Here’s my list for you right there.
32831,Leonard,Hissy fits? I have hissy fits?
32832,Penny,How are you guys getting along? What? Why are there tears?
32833,Penny,I’m sorry?
32834,Penny,Oh you weren’t joking.
32835,Sheldon,<i>She went into labor an hour ago.
32836,Penny,It’s a first edition of Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. I remember it was your favourite book growing up.
32837,Penny,Okay.
32838,Raj,Here you go cute huh?
32839,Sheldon,How is it I can conceptualize a methodology of examining dark matter in the universe but can’t figure out how to fix a novelty squirt flower?
32840,Howard,So I thought the photo booth for the party could either be creepy like a mummy’s tomb or they also have the Tardis from Doctor Who.
32841,Sheldon,Wow.
32842,Howard,37 minutes left until the deadline.
32843,Leonard,Come on he wasn’t that stupid.
32844,Raj,Why?
32845,Raj,He’s in Texas he’ll never know.
32846,Howard,Let’s leave Leonard out of this for the moment. This is about you and me.
32847,Howard,For you or with you?
32848,Howard,Don’t say your doom. Who opens the door for their doom?
32849,Penny,What now you’re interested? You didn’t even want to come.
32850,Leonard,She knows I have a girlfriend. It’s so weird.
32851,Howard,You sure?
32852,Raj,I’m sure you guys will figure something out.
32853,Leonard,Hey Penny if you’re not doing anything Friday night I thought maybe we could go and see a movie.
32854,Howard,Great. We can still make it to Comic-Con.
32855,Sheldon,For starters a bed-and-breakfast forces you to eat with strangers at your table.
32856,Raj,You know I read that washing dishes can be an excellent form of meditation. The key is that while washing the dishes one should only be washing the dishes.
32857,Sheldon,Yes. And we’re going to prove that we don’t need alcohol to enjoy ourselves.
32858,Raj,Don’t say your doom. Who opens the door for their doom?
32859,Sheldon,And another thing there’s a certain ethic to the game Penny a well estab…
32860,Leonard,Really?
32861,Leonard,You mean like through their window from behind a bush?
32862,Penny,Oh had to go to a sales seminar on our new sleeping pill.
32863,Leonard,Ooh interesting. Did you just propose to me again?
32864,Howard,Uh it’s in the corner.
32865,Sheldon,No no. This has been in my family for generations. Except for a short time when Comanches cut off my great-great-great-grandmother’s finger and stole it.
32866,Penny,You’re all alike.
32867,Sheldon,Yes. I may have lost my guidance system and my girlfriend but I still have a colon full of yesterday’s meals to keep me company. Although thanks to your high fibre breakfast I’m sure that’ll be leaving me too.
32868,Leonard,No.
32869,Leonard,Hey.
32870,Penny,Come on you do it to feel superior. I see that twinkle in your eye when someone says who instead of whom or thinks the moon is a planet.
32871,Penny,See if you had killed me when I said kill me I wouldn’t have had to hear that.
32872,Howard,You were right. I can’t get out of here.
32873,Sheldon,It’s not an accident. I waited outside your door for twenty minutes.
32874,Leonard,East Texas.
32875,Raj,How bad is it?
32876,Raj,Yeah that’s right. Keep asking yourself that. But I still love you very much so don’t cut me out of the will.
32877,Leonard,Why don’t we play this smart? Try a little good goblin bad goblin.
32878,Sheldon,Who said that? Leonard I can hear your voice but I can’t see you.
32879,Howard,Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz is requested to report to the NASA Johnson Space Center Houston Texas for astronaut training Monday eight a.m.
32880,Sheldon,Yeah Julie Newmar Michelle Pfieffer Eartha Kitt and then her.
32881,Sheldon,Very well. Oops how clumsy of me. You know what? Let me get that. Hey. Where are you going? I did you even look at my bottom?
32882,Penny,But it’s Thursday. Thursday’s pizza night.
32883,Leonard,I saw what you did there.
32884,Leonard,I even said off the chain mail and she still wants to go.
32885,Howard,I could have made her very happy.
32886,Sheldon,Of course my good friend. Come in. Help me out which ski hat says après supercollider?
32887,Sheldon,Perfect. Now I’m considering investing in Stuart’s comic book store.
32888,Penny,Like what?
32889,Raj,Great then we’ll get married I won’t be able to talk to her and we’ll spend the rest of our lives in total silence.
32890,Leonard,You guys might want to start eating. But you won’t be living here.
32891,Sheldon,Leonard.
32892,Leonard,That’s it? Did he give any reason as to why he came to this moral epiphany?
32893,Raj,I would like to propose a salon topic.
32894,Leonard,No because I didn’t want her on my team.
32895,Sheldon,Hmm? Oh. Amy showed me a compelling study that demonstrated the cognitive benefit of spending time in the wilderness.
32896,Howard,Wow your work on jellyfish neural nets sounds so interesting.
32897,Leonard,That’s the definition of being a know-it-all.
32898,Sheldon,Oh God! One two three!
32899,Sheldon,Oh tweets about my lecture. Hmm. That’s rather unfair. That’s downright cruel. Plus insects have six legs. Yeah I’m not familiar with the acronym KMN.
32900,Sheldon,Yeah yeah enough debate I’m going to take action.  Excuse me are you currently involved in a sexual relationship?
32902,Leonard,You got Penny to sign up for online dating?
32903,Penny,Wow you should come to girls’ night more often. And not just because if you weren’t here this would be a can of Pabst.
32904,Leonard,Why are you taking his side?
32905,Leonard,I’m not.
32906,Howard,Look I’m a lonely guy I watch a lot of movies. Look Penny if you truly want to be romantic it needs to come from you.
32907,Leonard,Sheldon we can’t let him drive.
32908,Howard,Well I like to think I take mostly after you. Anyway speaking of Daddy I had a very strange conversation with him. He said he couldn’t afford to send me money any more because of his active social life.
32909,Leonard,That’s nice. What about?
32910,Sheldon,Why would a physics bowl team be called anodised aluminium?
32911,Leonard,Maybe we’re not ready to hang out as friends.
32912,Leonard,I can figure this out let’s see. Um well beavers eat tree bark. The only tree bark I know that humans consume is cinnamon. So I’ll say cinnamon.
32913,Sheldon,Leonard you hear that? Professor Proton said I should call him Arthur. That means we’re friends.
32914,Raj,Thank you. How come you didn’t call me this morning?
32915,Sheldon,But then who will bring me my cheeseburger on Tuesday nights?
32916,Sheldon,Wooh boy you are all over the place this morning.  I have a masters and two PhD’s I should not have to do this.
32917,Raj,No.
32918,Leonard,Penny’s been keeping him up at night.
32919,Sheldon,Raj Raj she’s got me cornered cover me.
32920,Sheldon,I didn’t have to the dates just happened to coincide.
32921,Leonard,Yeah every night for the last month.
32922,Howard,I I nibbled. I was being playful.
32923,Leonard,Sit down.
32924,Leonard,Oh I’ve got butterflies.
32925,Sheldon,I’m in the matrix Leonard I see everything.
32926,Howard,He’s right. If you think about it we’re all in charge.
32927,Sheldon,All right that concludes the getting to know you portion of the evening. Who’s ready to play some vintage video games? And tonight’s selections include ColecoVision’s Smurf Rescue in Gargamel’s Castle Atari’s Cookie Monster Munch and for you text adventure aficionados Zork. Pick me pick me. I’m fun.
32928,Penny,Neck shot lime.  Okay shot lime.
32929,Raj,May the fourth be with you?
32930,Penny,Get him bring him back.
32931,Penny,I’m listening.
32932,Raj,Ooh. Okay let’s hope one of the clues is written on a pair of clean underwear.
32933,Raj,Hey want to spend some time playing the new Star Wars game this weekend?
32934,Leonard,Sheldon it’s me.
32935,Leonard,Well it wasn’t spray-painting a lightning bolt on my briefcase I can tell you that.
32936,Penny,I just thought I’d stop by and say hello.
32937,Leonard,Oh it’s a scaly genital organ that grows between his shoulder blades. Try not to touch it when you’re dancing.
32938,Sheldon,That’s not true.
32939,Leonard,They say it could be a potential indicator of life on other planets.
32940,Penny,What was that for?
32941,Howard,I’m sorry guys. Sheldon was upset Leonard and Penny were fighting I just wanted to go some place where I wasn’t causing problems.
32942,Raj,He doesn’t just look like C-3PO now he walks like him.
32943,Sheldon,You mixed them. No wonder gentleman callers are pounding down your door. Do you have any questions for me?
32944,Sheldon,Who?
32945,Sheldon,Wait. You were really gonna stand by me against the dining room table?
32946,Sheldon,Okay. I can do this. Just give me a moment… Oh! Mimosas coming up.
32947,Leonard,Wait I don’t which part?
32948,Howard,He got us again.
32949,Leonard,Well we got to make a run to the hardware store.
32950,Penny,I can’t believe you’re engaged to my friend. Oh here she comes.
32951,Raj,On Caprica night?
32952,Sheldon,And if anyone were to actually call that number they will hear this.
32953,Penny,Oh what a jerk.
32954,Sheldon,Fine. In the parlance of the urban music scene what’s the 4-1-1?
32956,Sheldon,Why is there a hole in my new office? I’ve narrowed it down to two possibilities There was something in the wall that someone outside the wall wanted or the more disturbing there was something in the wall that wanted out.
32957,Raj,That’s funny because those aren’t the kind of kisses you want on your nipples.
32958,Penny,Fine. I’m calling home but when I’m done you’re calling your mother.
32959,Penny,Oh my I would love that.
32960,Penny,And it looks like she lost a lot of weight damn it.
32961,Sheldon,Oh yes. The losers will be publicly humiliated in a fashion to be chosen by the victor. FYI I plan on having you publish a scientific paper expounding the discredited Velikovsky hypothesis.
32962,Leonard,Hey Penny.
32963,Penny,Oh now I need your permission for that too?!
32964,Leonard,We’re just bending the rules a little. We have grant money to do the experiment so we’re going to spend it on the helium we need. It’s not like when Dr. Goldfarb claimed he bought an electron microscope and he was really just keeping a Russian girl in an apartment in Van Nuys.
32965,Penny,And what’s that?
32966,Howard,Well that’s just Batman.
32967,Raj,You’d have no girlfriend to see you naked you’d try to fill the void with food and I’m an enabler who once deep-fried a pancake.
32968,Howard,It’s gross but I have to eat it because I met somebody.
32969,Raj,No no Penny don’t dismiss his feelings.
32970,Raj,Can we please talk about something other than my depressing love life?
32971,Howard,Of course.
32972,Leonard,Hi-lo. Oops. I started to say hi and then I switched to hello in the middle. It came out hi-lo. Duh. Uh it’s nice to meet you. I’ve read both your books and most of your papers. I’m Leonard I live
32973,Howard,Uh okay that’s a separate issue. Let’s put a pin in that and just focus on the passive thing.
32974,Sheldon,Oh Lord you just rang Stan Lee’s doorbell. At Stan Lee’s house. We’re about to go in and have milk and cookies with Stan Lee.
32975,Leonard,You know why. The Nintendo DS. And the PSP. Now the Gameboy.
32976,Raj,Psh what a bunch of crybabies. No guts no glory man.
32978,Leonard,All right maybe I overreacted. So we’re in two different places emotionally. So what? And maybe I’m a little ahead of you. That’s fine. You know. In fact it makes sense ’cause let’s face it I’ve been in this relationship two years longer than you.
32980,Penny,Oh sure. Let me see it.
32981,Leonard,I can’t believe they did that.
32982,Leonard,Please don’t be upset. I just I didn’t want you ending up with a bad grade and get discouraged and give up on the idea of going back to school.
32983,Leonard,Yeah. You too. Uh Jimmy this is Sheldon and Raj and Howard.
32984,Sheldon,Coming. 
32985,Leonard,Will Amy be joining us for dinner?
32986,Leonard,You’re being ridiculous.
32987,Sheldon,Oh! No I beg to differ. Of the three of us I was by far the most supportive.
32988,Raj,Yeah but since you and Penny finally hooked up we thought you two would be having bouncy naked yum-yum night.
32989,Penny,Okay look if Leonard finds out that I lied I will absolutely die of embarrassment.
32990,Penny,Okay. Then what happened?
32991,Penny,Oh my God. What a day.
32992,Penny,You okay? You kind of look like Zack trying to figure out that tip.
32993,Howard,Though we did ding up the back pretty good with the crib so you might have bought a minivan.
32994,Sheldon,And you understand that will involve me telling you what to do?
32995,Sheldon,Mm. I want to build a road but I need wood. Do either of you fellows have wood?  I don’t understand the laughter. The object of Settlers of Catan is to build roads and settlements. To do so requires wood. Now I have sheep; I need wood. Who has wood for my sheep?
32996,Sheldon,Irrelevant. Rajesh and I have a good thing going and you’re not going to ruin it.  What are you doing here?
32997,Leonard,Sheldon that’s incredible.
32998,Leonard,Okay what exactly are we looking for?
33000,Leonard,Uh-huh?
33001,Leonard,Sheldon are you gonna join us?
33002,Sheldon,I had not considered that.
33003,Howard,Really ten miles? You’re orbiting inside the atmosphere? Moron.
33004,Sheldon,Why would you do that?
33005,Sheldon,They have beach right in the name. What do you think?
33006,Sheldon,There’s a motion on the floor I’m ridiculous. Do we have a second? Hmm? Hmm? There is no second. The motion is denied. Next time make sure you have the votes first. That was embarrassing.
33007,Howard,I think I know the answer to this but just to be clear it’s not me right?
33008,Penny,Well we will. We’re just not in a rush.
33009,Leonard,You’ll wish it would kill you.
33010,Howard,Wait my laptop. 
33011,Sheldon,There are a number of options and I’m really not familiar enough with the cushion densities air flow patterns and dispersion of sunlight to make an informed choice.
33012,Leonard,Next we need a teaspoon of pepper which I believe was also the name of your childhood dog.
33013,Penny,Aw sweetie I’m comfortable around you too.
33014,Leonard,Oh hey.
33015,Sheldon,If any of you are looking for something to do on Valentine’s Day Amy and I’ll be streaming our first-ever live episode of Fun With Flags. You’re welcome to join us as we celebrate the timeless love affair between wind and flapping fabric.
33016,Penny,Never mind.
33017,Leonard,Oh wow. I love Taming of the Shrew. I did a paper on it in high school. Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting? In his tail.
33018,Sheldon,They don’t? Well apparently these people and I differ greatly on the definition of party.
33019,Penny,Amy you look great.
33020,Leonard,Oh a gift certificate for motorcycle lessons. Very thoughtful.
33021,Leonard,Snort it down and keep eating!
33022,Sheldon,Well perhaps I can help. Sherlock Holmes always says when you eliminate the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth. Now have have you tried doing that?
33024,Penny,Mm.
33025,Sheldon,English is your native language.
33026,Raj,Okay uh you check for squeaks and I will mark them down.
33027,Raj,You know I I’ve been thinking that maybe meeting somebody one-on-one is too intense so Friday night my friends are having a party.
33028,Leonard,Well I’m not trying to have sex with her.
33029,Raj,Look I know you guys are upset but we’ve talked about it and we think it’d be beneficial for you to be part of the project.
33030,Howard,And that bright little star peeking her head out early today that’s Venus.
33031,Penny,Just a warning Sheldon the freezer locks from the outside.
33032,Howard,Can I tell her I miss her?
33033,Raj,Oh dude. The minute you opened that e-mail they knew you got it. I mean they’re probably looking at you through the camera right now. I love America.
33034,Sheldon,I think I understand. You’re the one person who can say Sheldon Cooper is your boyfriend but that rings hollow if you can’t lord him over others in the flesh. I forget what I bring to the party and what I take away when I leave. Please accept these valuable Cooper Coupons as restitution.
33035,Penny,Leonard is wrong.
33036,Sheldon,No. That wouldn’t be funny at all.
33037,Sheldon,Look on the bright side.
33038,Howard,Guys before this gets ugly remember the winner gets Sheldon.
33039,Sheldon,Well apparently the news didn’t reach my digestive system which when startled has its own version of Anything Can Happen Thursday.
33040,Leonard,No I want you to go.
33041,Leonard,Maybe we should start small.
33042,Sheldon,I don’t think so. Leonard can’t stand yoga the beach massages or dancing.
33043,Leonard,Of course.
33044,Raj,Oh come on man. Bros before… my sister.
33045,Penny,You work with Sheldon you tell me.
33047,Howard,So you never played baseball as a kid not even Little League?
33048,Penny,Maybe he didn’t notice.
33049,Raj,I thought Stuart was looking after her.
33050,Sheldon,Neck massage then you get me that beverage.
33051,Sheldon,It’s all gone. All gone.
33052,Leonard,Thanks.
33053,Leonard,And you think my presence will help with that?
33054,Sheldon,Excuse me. No one does a better job pretending to be a person than I do. Siri comes close but I know more jokes.
33055,Sheldon,Yeah it seems only right that she have it back.
33056,Leonard,Invite them to live with us.
33057,Leonard,Sheldon you are not in charge.
33058,Raj,Hey Stuart.
33059,Leonard,Can you focus on what we’re talking about?
33061,Sheldon,R2-D2 and C-3PO. Dibs on Threepio.
33062,Leonard,Putting them on.
33063,Howard,Let’s set up the equipment. It’ll help take your mind off of it.
33064,Penny,No you were right the first time this is a man who loves me but in his own stupid way he was just trying to show people how he feels.
33065,Penny,Yeah. It comes from the swear jar we put money in when you curse.
33066,Penny,More potion please.
33067,Raj,Thank you Sheldon. It’s a blank notebook.
33068,Raj,Oh but there’s money for a drawer full of Red Vines a marshmallow shooting rifle and a super executive ant farm with glow-in-the-dark sand?
33069,Leonard,Just to be clear sex is off the table right?
33070,Penny,Well that sucks.
33071,Leonard,I don’t think that’s going to happen Sheldon.
33072,Leonard,Okay well tell him I loved him on Star Trek.
33073,Sheldon, Leonard…
33074,Raj,No he’s doesn’t! He’s lying to you!
33075,Penny,I do your life is fine you big baby.
33076,Leonard,Really?
33077,Sheldon,Regarding what?
33078,Leonard,Um…
33079,Leonard,Hey. How about we bring back Anything Can Happen Thursdays?
33080,Penny,Gee Sheldon you’re asking the wrong girl. I’m usually on the other side of the tie.
33081,Sheldon,I don’t see how a tax lawyer from Fort Lauderdale could be helpful regarding intellectual property.
33082,Sheldon,Where didn’t I go? I went to New York Chicago Atlanta Denver Seattle.
33083,Sheldon,Where are you going?
33084,Leonard,See? Now that’s the great thing. We’re out as friends. This is not a date. Sex is off the table. So let’s go learn why hydroelectric power might not be the environmental bargain you think it is. Sorry. Spoiler alert.
33085,Sheldon,I don’t want to hear this.
33086,Sheldon,Oh please I was just pointing it out. I have no desire to engage in the activity.
33087,Sheldon,How about Penny’s depressing acting career?
33088,Sheldon,I remember him.
33089,Raj,That’s so much better than the old ugly ones.
33090,Howard,What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to choose between Emily and Lucy?
33091,Raj,So does that mean we can go with the girls again?
33092,Leonard,So Amy what’s going on with your addiction study?
33093,Sheldon,Goody. What’s it say?
33094,Penny,No. You know what? Don’t. Don’t. Let’s let them think they’re getting away with it.
33095,Sheldon,How do I know you’re not going to take my ideas and publish them as your own?
33096,Penny,Come on you got to work with me. We need to get connected with our bodies.
33097,Sheldon,We can’t sell it. We have to keep it and love it and polish it and only take it out occasionally when we go to the park and re-enact our favourite scenes from the movies.
33098,Sheldon,What’s sheetrock?
33099,Leonard,Look I’m still happy to drive you to work. Nothing’s changed in that regard. We’re still roommates we’re still friends.
33100,Sheldon,So what other celebrity genitalia have you handled?
33101,Raj,Good because I would hate that.
33102,Sheldon,Ah much better.
33103,Howard,Sheldon when I said I was fine I meant I didn’t want to talk about it any more.
33104,Raj,Well at least you finally got a window that opens. That’s nice.
33105,Leonard,Hmm? Yeah? What? Huh?
33106,Leonard,Pass.
33107,Sheldon,Oh well you can’t blame me for not jumping to that conclusion.
33108,Sheldon,It’s too late. Get ready to like me.
33109,Raj,Oh I have to go to the bathroom so bad.
33110,Raj,Not at all. He’s forgotten how miserable he was the entire time he was up there. It’s like me in those moments when I miss India.
33111,Leonard,Who just had sex with me at work.
33112,Penny,See ya.
33113,Leonard,Did it ever occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort organise and label the entire world around them?
33114,Leonard,Tell me why you woke me up or I swear to God I will kill you.
33115,Sheldon,Would it help if I gave him some pointers? I’m just funnin’ ya.
33116,Howard,You did?
33117,Leonard,No one told you to taste them. Come on is is this good or not?
33118,Penny,Okay okay you know I get it Leonard has no business being involved with a waitress slash actress who felt so insecure that she lied to him about finishing community college.
33119,Sheldon,Oh I heard about that. Why didn’t you discover it?
33120,Sheldon,Darts is a bar game. You’ve been frequenting drinking establishments since you were of legal age.
33121,Leonard,You know thanks for closed-captioning my pain Raj.
33122,Raj,Uh it’s in the corner.
33123,Leonard,Not that secret the other secret.
33124,Sheldon,I have no difficulty believing you’re not butter.
33125,Sheldon,Abundantly.
33126,Sheldon,Superheroes take performance-enhancing chemicals?
33127,Leonard,Yeah yeah that too.
33128,Leonard,I can vouch for that.
33129,Penny,It means nothing to anybody. Come here let me show you what I’m doing.
33130,Raj,Sorry papa.
33131,Sheldon,This is the swampland of Dagobah. It’s where Luke was trained in the ways of the Jedi.
33132,Sheldon,What? I didn’t sign it yet.
33133,Leonard,My Physics Bowl Trophy!
33134,Penny,Okay look they sent me the ticket. I told them I wasn’t driving and they were all if it wasn’t you who was it?
33135,Howard,Amy I could use some help.
33136,Sheldon,Hmm well it’s a little Hollywood. But I think I can pull it off. Well done Penny.
33137,Penny,Maybe that’s because your hole is still open.
33138,Leonard,I don’t know now they’re just yelling about Popsicles. Sounds like Penny really got to him.
33139,Sheldon,Irrelevant. See I was studying recombinant DNA technology and I was confident I could create one but my parents were unwilling to secure the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen. Course my sister got swimming lessons when she wanted them.
33140,Howard,Have you heard from Howard?
33141,Sheldon,You stayed in Michigan all week to avoid being around me?
33142,Sheldon,So you admit that you’re an egotist?
33143,Leonard,Potl.
33144,Leonard,I was just thinking we should probably turn in too.
33145,Sheldon,He does sound effects too!
33146,Raj,Well good for him.
33147,Leonard,Look most importantly this will let you move on and study dark matter.
33148,Howard,What’s Plan B?
33149,Leonard,Are you sure? I’d really like to.
33151,Sheldon,It is not my fault that your mother likes me better than she likes you.
33152,Sheldon,Yes but it’s like you’re right here in the room.
33153,Sheldon,Oh even better than money. You gained experience points.
33154,Penny,Yes absolutely. Now they’re doing that phony link-arm-drink thingy. I totally taught him that.
33155,Penny,Okay you can’t just go chasing after every girl who’s nice to you.
33156,Howard,What do we do now?
33157,Leonard,Good night.
33158,Penny,Dammit dammit dammit dammit dammit dammit.
33159,Sheldon,No.
33160,Leonard,Oh we can get this. Is there any chance it’s upside-down?
33161,Penny,Well I have broken up with my fair share of guys. I mean how many times did I break up with Leonard?
33162,Raj,Hey how come I wasn’t part of this deal?
33163,Sheldon,You have two strikes. Three strikes and you’re out. It’s a sports metaphor.
33164,Sheldon,Well that’s not much of an apology but I’ll take it.
33165,Howard,It’s also a live mine so there’ll be dynamite explosions going off in the distance.
33166,Raj,That is so cool. Old broken things are so much better than new things that work.
33167,Sheldon,I’ll leave it up to the dungeon master.
33168,Sheldon,Well her actions could be out of concern for your feelings. Perhaps she’s excluded you from these gatherings because she’s scouting for a new mate and doesn’t want to do it in front of you.
33169,Penny,Well not necessarily. You know Dad’s not getting any younger so if I wait long enough I’ll just tell him he walked me down the aisle and it was magical.
33170,Leonard,If you’ll recall the Vogon fleet blew up the Earth anyway.
33171,Howard,Calm down. Howard has something he wants to say to you.
33172,Sheldon,She broke up with me.
33173,Sheldon,Because I have no interest in standing in the Rose Room of the Pasadena Marriott in front of a group of judgemental strangers who wouldn’t recognise true genius if it were standing in front of them giving a speech. Which if I were there it would be.
33174,Sheldon,Yes please. Your girlfriend’s a little short-tempered.
33175,Raj,Yeah I read your paper online. That technique for creating a new heavy element is inspired.
33176,Howard,That’s why I already cleaned up in here and all the other rooms in the hall.
33177,Howard,This is fun. I have never cleaned a toilet before.
33178,Sheldon,Everything is quantifiable. That French fry? A seven. Spider-Man? A nine. The number nine? Oddly only a four.
33179,Sheldon,But I’m a professional scientist.
33180,Leonard,There is no season three. They cancelled that show.
33181,Howard,Now you listen to me I am no longer a child and I will not be spoken to like one. Now if you’d excuse me I have to go throw up.
33182,Raj,Ooh!
33183,Sheldon,Where did you move it?
33184,Sheldon,Yes.
33185,Leonard,Really? That’s amazing. And you gave me the robes to give it in. Thank you.
33186,Sheldon,I won’t be able to make our date night this Thursday so bad news for you.
33187,Leonard,You can’t be serious. ‘Cause I messed up and made out with a girl you’re gonna do the same with a random guy?
33188,Sheldon,If you’ll excuse me I’m going to pack.
33189,Leonard,Yeah I know the feeling.
33191,Sheldon,Yeah. And forgive my crude penmanship. I didn’t start typing until I was six.
33192,Sheldon,Not Sunday I love Sunday.
33193,Sheldon,No that’s not it.
33194,Howard,Yeah okay just do me a favour and stop talking about how great Claire is.
33195,Raj,Yep I don’t see any way around it.
33196,Sheldon,Stop! I’m going to wet myself!
33197,Penny,Oh yeah no this thing’s majorly out of order.  See? Sorry.
33198,Sheldon,It’s one of a kind.
33199,Raj,Please. You’re looking at Facebook to find out how their date went.
33200,Raj,Then she’s going to have to convince your mother to let you go into space.
33201,Leonard,You guys have any idea how much it costs to see a marriage counsellor?
33202,Raj,Dude come on.
33203,Sheldon,My Mee-Maw must never know of this. Now will you give Professor Hawking my paper?
33204,Penny,Yeah you got it.
33205,Penny,Oh yeah me too.
33206,Howard,You know a man can care deeply about a woman and a pet. It’s not strange.
33207,Leonard,Uh just give us a few minutes.
33208,Penny,I’m fine.
33209,Leonard,Still I think it’s time for me to get rid of this stuff and… you know… move on with my life.
33210,Sheldon,Well if you are so protective of the scientific method perhaps we should use the next five weeks to finish what we started.
33211,Raj,Yes.
33212,Penny,Okay fine. Well what if we just flip it over? There. Looks fine right?
33213,Sheldon,I have a functioning and satisfying relationship with a female. You have none.
33214,Howard,Three times. He begged the Fox network not to cancel Firefly. He begged the TNT network to cancel Babylon 5. And when he got food poisoning at the Rose Bowl Parade he begged a deity he doesn’t believe in to end his life quickly.
33215,Leonard,Wait I got it. I got it/
33216,Sheldon,Because if it did have to do with trains and you were gonna give…
33217,Leonard,It’s right off the dust jacket of my mom’s last book.
33218,Sheldon,Congratulations Dr. Fowler. You just made the fort.
33219,Raj,They’re not even trying. Remember the Satanimals pack with the Hellephant? Why absurd. What was he a bad elephant who died and went to hell? What could an elephant possibly do that would cause him eternal damnation?
33220,Leonard,Hey look who’s out after dark like a big boy.
33221,Leonard,I don’t care about that.
33222,Penny,Nice hat Sheldon.
33223,Raj,Thank you. Good luck with your future endeavours.
33224,Howard,Yeah. Hey you know if this was in Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment I wouldn’t wind up sitting on the floor all the time.
33225,Leonard,Hey.
33226,Penny,Sure.
33227,Leonard,Yeah I’m so glad you guys could watch.
33228,Penny,Yeah.
33229,Raj,Do that. See?
33230,Sheldon,Another happy accident.
33231,Sheldon,Alright but if we’re going to use flight metaphors I’m much more suited to being the guy from the FAA analysing wreckage.
33232,Leonard,Something you’d like to share? A tale of woe perhaps.
33233,Howard,Ooh uh Emily gets off work soon. Why don’t the four of us go out?
33234,Penny,No no it’s okay. I mean let’s face it you guys would get creamed without me.
33235,Penny,All right.
33236,Sheldon,Of course it will require a vote. Unfortunately my official gavel is in my bedroom but luckily I have my travel gavel.
33237,Leonard,No that was a different different guy.
33238,Leonard,I don’t know. Should we call Sheldon and Howard?
33239,Penny,Sheldon we know this is a sensitive subject and Leonard’s not gonna move out until you’re ready.
33240,Sheldon,A far less impressive feat.
33241,Sheldon,Look I’m sorry you violated the terms of your metaphor by acknowledging her existence. I’m out.
33242,Penny,Hi! Stephanie right?
33243,Sheldon,That was fun. Maybe tomorrow we can go to one of those big warehouse stores.
33244,Sheldon,I know how to get the bucket! I can turn the axe around and use the handle to reach it. Let’s see. Go north. You are in a forest. Go north. You are in a forest. Go north. You are in a forest. Oh dear I believe I’m lost. Well I’ll just have to get a fresh start tomorrow.
33246,Sheldon,Well not with that attitude.
33248,Howard,Come in.
33249,Penny,Okay.
33250,Raj,Oh that sounds lovely.
33251,Penny,So you said you had something to tell me.
33252,Leonard,Howard listen to me.
33253,Sheldon,Good what?
33254,Leonard,Okay. We’ll be back as soon as we can.
33255,Sheldon,Well excuse me Amy was testing you. I was rooting for you. Good job on that banana box by the way.
33256,Penny,Oh hey.
33257,Penny,Well he asked me out again and I said yes and then I started thinking maybe I should talk to you first.
33258,Leonard,What? no. no that’s not right.
33259,Sheldon,Yes.
33260,Leonard,I’ll be there as soon as I can.
33261,Penny,Oh I don’t want credit for that.
33262,Raj,One.
33263,Raj,Okay. I know. It was me. I I pushed too hard. I’m sorry.
33264,Howard,Wow. What did you tell them?
33265,Penny,There’s some in the fridge.
33266,Penny,Why would we want that?
33267,Penny,One two three four five. No way.
33268,Sheldon,Oh yes. Canine football fans are a common sight in Texas. Cats however refuse to wear sporting apparel. My sister found that out the hard way.
33269,Penny,Any particular reason why?
33270,Leonard,Oh sounds great.
33271,Howard,Sheldon is a very smart man and he obviously wants to keep this a secret.
33272,Sheldon,How about a hearty handshake?
33273,Leonard,I don’t think it matters if this is a stalemate or an impasse or a Mexican standoff. What are we gonna do here?
33274,Raj,My turn.
33275,Penny,Yeah hang on. Let me just finish this chapter.
33276,Sheldon,That’s me. Bye Stuart.
33277,Howard,Like to music?
33278,Sheldon,Ooh my friend Stephen just played the word act for 18 points. That’s right I call him Stephen now because I checked and he was not okay with Wheels.
33279,Sheldon,So as they say all good things must come to an end.
33280,Sheldon,This is Penny. She is your friend. If she offers you food it’s safe to take it. You probably paid for it anyway.
33281,Leonard,Well I’m sure he’ll appreciate carrying his samples in a briefcase instead of his colon. How long do you think he’ll stay?
33282,Sheldon,Oh great now you’re gonna get emotional. I always looked up to you and Pop-Pop. I I know what a challenging man he could be but I saw you stand by him and-and make him into a better person.
33283,Raj,How hard did she stomp?
33284,Howard,Fine. Um on the count of three. One two…
33285,Penny,Sheldon what did you do?
33286,Leonard,Actually all I did was invite you.
33287,Penny,What the hell?
33288,Sheldon,Ooh a pocket watch.
33289,Sheldon,A menial job. Like yours.
33290,Penny,Oh God!
33291,Howard,Okay I think we should do it right now.
33292,Leonard,I’m sorry what were the choices again?
33293,Penny,Oh you know he’s good.
33294,Penny,Oh what what what?
33295,Raj,No I got it.
33296,Leonard,Which book are we looking for?
33297,Sheldon,Well it makes perfect sense. Because you’re an expectant mother you can’t drink alcohol. I don’t like to. You can’t have sushi. I don’t like to. You can’t go in hot tubs. I consider them vats of sweaty people soup.
33298,Howard,Hello.
33299,Penny,I’m sorry. What was I thinking?
33300,Leonard,Now. 
33301,Penny,Actually we got in a pretty nasty fight.
33302,Sheldon,Okay now you’re going to insert the flash drive into the USB port. She calls me Moon Pie because I’m nummy-nummy and she could just eat me up now please put the flash drive in the USB port. The one that looks like a little duck’s mouth.
33303,Howard,Sheldon doesn’t get along with Sheldon. It’s still no reason for me to have to listen to you arm your photon torpedoes every night.
33304,Sheldon,No I don’t think you are.
33305,Leonard,I know and there’s no excuse for that.
33306,Leonard,Hmm I’m a professor at Stanford.
33307,Leonard,Here let me try. Call McFlono McFloonyloo. Heh-heh.
33308,Sheldon,What is the best number? By the way there’s only one correct answer.
33309,Howard,Oh yes. You must be Lakshmi. Uh nice to meet you.
33310,Leonard,What’s going on?
33311,Penny,No. No woman would.
33312,Leonard,Because you do this kind of thing all the time and then you try to cover it up.
33313,Penny,What? That is not true. Bernadette wants a pre-nup.
33314,Leonard,You are unbelievable. I don’t know why I put up with you. You’re controlling you’re irritating.
33315,Penny,Thanks. He seems like a nice guy.
33316,Leonard,Alright alright. Boy we are learning a lot here huh? Thank you astronaut Howard. Um I am what’s called an experimental physicist which is super-fun because I get to test theories and work with lasers. Yes?
33317,Leonard,And mythological.
33318,Sheldon,Oh there you are. Leonard I know you’re upset about recent events and I have someone here to help. 
33319,Howard,Actually I’m busy.
33320,Leonard,That’s not what I meant.
33321,Howard,Look at us. We’re like the Rockettes.
33322,Sheldon,Yes half eagle half lion.
33323,Leonard,Okay well thanks for sharing with us. Good night.
33324,Sheldon,And now you’re out of life. Why did you hit pause?
33325,Leonard,Why would I want to do that?
33326,Howard,Well there’s a reception for my magazine article on Saturday.
33327,Penny,Wow.
33328,Sheldon,It’s eleven fifteen. I’m requesting your quarter-hourly location update.
33329,Leonard,What Sheldon? What Sheldon? What Sheldon?
33330,Sheldon,I’m Dr. Cooper from the Physics Department.
33331,Howard,I’ll do it.
33332,Howard,Oh okay great. Now I can look like Val Kilmer as Batman instead of Val Kilmer as he looks today.
33333,Leonard,Really when was the last time you left the house.
33334,Leonard,Hey you can make jokes but if this keeps up he’s gonna move back in here.
33335,Sheldon,No no of course you have to publish. That’s your responsibility as a scientist. Doing otherwise would be unethical. You have no choice.
33336,Sheldon,Ah good Penny you’re here to exchange gifts. You’ll be pleased to know I’m prepared for whatever you have to offer.
33337,Sheldon,I’m sorry. I was trying to think of what rhymes with nose of the aardvark.
33338,Sheldon,Am I? Here. Eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister.
33339,Leonard,Hmm Priya’s not back yet? Well I guess that’s not unusual women men the whole sitting standing deal so what are we talking about?
33340,Leonard,What the hell are bus pants?
33341,Leonard,Who’s Paul?
33342,Raj,How can I meet someone new when everywhere I look I see Lucy’s face? Tell me you don’t see her smile in the crust of this chicken pot pie.
33343,Sheldon,Great. Tropicana no pulp.
33344,Leonard,Are you really gonna sit here all day?
33345,Penny,No sorry. Wait! Please come back!
33346,Sheldon,Hang on hang on. We’re smart we can figure this out. Okay so Mary and Beverley can’t be together. Uh Alfred and Beverley can’t be together. Leonard and I can’t be together. Now I could be with Alfred but I don’t like his face. Oh here. I’ve got it.
33347,Penny,Yeah maybe.
33348,Leonard,Hey Barry we’re in trouble. We need liquid helium does the department have any we can use?
33349,Sheldon,It’s amusing that he doesn’t hear it.
33350,Sheldon,A Christmas gift? You know I don’t enjoy Christmas.
33351,Howard,You know India?
33352,Leonard,I mean you could say thank you. I did just buy you a car.
33353,Leonard,We’re not.
33354,Leonard,What are you talking about?
33355,Sheldon,Well no sir and do you know why? In a word tradition. Every Thursday night for the last eight years you and I and our friends have gathered here in this very spot to break bread covered with cheese and sauce discuss the issues of the day and yes share a laugh or two. But I guess our rich heritage means nothing to you.
33356,Raj,Booya.
33357,Leonard,It’s late. We’ve wasted hours. Can we please find it in ourselves to do any amount of work tonight?
33358,Leonard,So Sheldon says you have a new girlfriend.
33359,Raj,So as Hannah Montana Miley was a world-famous pop star. But then she would take off her wig and go to school like a normal girl. Which I don’t have to tell you at that age is its own headache.
33360,Leonard,You know it’s not exactly glamorous up there. The water that the astronauts drink is made from each other’s recycled urine.
33361,Sheldon,And I have the soulful eyes of a cow.
33362,Sheldon,Well I hope you’re wrong. I really want to go to the train store.
33363,Sheldon,I’ve seen that. Yeah. Serial Apeist. Howard found it online the day we met you.
33364,Raj,You’re kidding.
33365,Raj,I give you one simple thing to do contact a complete stranger and make her fall in love with me and you blow it.
33366,Sheldon,Why would you do such a thing?
33367,Leonard,What’s he doing in your apartment?
33368,Sheldon,I miss Stuart’s place. All this loud music and exposed brick. What is this a comic book store or a rave at the third little pig’s house?
33369,Leonard,Oh it’s complicated. He finds pushing that little door and reaching up into the machine
33370,Sheldon,You know what you could make us do? Ice-skating. The cold air will trigger Leonard’s asthma and it plays right into my well-known fear of getting flattened by a Zamboni.
33371,Leonard,Okay listen I don’t mean to diminish what you’re going through but I’m a little distracted right now.
33372,Sheldon,I thought that was gonna break the other way.
33373,Penny,She’s right. That’s reasonable.
33374,Leonard,So wait what have you been doing for the past six months?
33375,Raj,It’s different. You’re people don’t worship lox.
33376,Leonard,You’re not helping.
33377,Raj,And then after coffee we went for a walk and she told me she always thought people from India were exotic and mysterious. So with my mouth I said we’re just like anybody else but with my eyes I said straight up Red hop on my flying carpet.
33378,Penny,You’re so butch.
33379,Sheldon,Good morning. If I could have everyone’s attention please? I know we’re all eager to get on the road to Big Sur so if we focus I’m sure we can get through this orientation in under a half an hour. Then it’s just Q&A quiz safety drills pose for commemorative group photo and we’re off.
33380,Sheldon,I don’t think your heart’s in it but since you asked. Apparently because Leonard is dating Raj’s sister we’re all forced to hang out at his apartment.
33381,Penny,It’s open.
33382,Raj,My cousin does work in a call centre.
33383,Leonard,Hi Howard.
33384,Leonard,Hey.
33385,Penny,Yeah well I’m supposed to be in Vegas throwing up on a shrimp buffet. Now give it. All right what do I need?
33386,Howard,You slipped and fell into a robot hand?
33387,Sheldon,That nagging tone is helping my anxiety yeah. But if you could maybe just go ten percent less shrill that’d really put the zip-a-dee in my doo-dah.
33388,Leonard,You want to talk about it?
33389,Raj,Now can we have cookies and Hawaiian Punch?
33390,Penny,Ugh. Hey Sheldon? Hi. This came for you today. It’s from your mom.
33391,Howard,Yeah I was. I was 200 pounds by the time I was in middle school. Kids were mean. Cows may be sacred there but it doesn’t help if you look like one. Anyway I was pretty lonely so I had to make up my own stories and games and I promised myself if I ever made any friends that that I would play those games with them.
33392,Leonard,Good. 
33393,Sheldon,So let’s roll up our sleevis and get to know Nevis.  Well I I like that but next time check with me.
33394,Penny,Sheldon’s spot. The coin is in your spot.
33395,Sheldon,Her behaviour. No I have the feeling that she’s hiding something.
33396,Raj,So did I.
33397,Sheldon,Oh good. Then you won’t be disappointed.
33398,Sheldon,No we don’t.
33399,Penny,All right then break it off with the new girl.
33400,Raj,Oh me too. You’re so caring. I’ve often pictured you guiding a young boy into manhood.
33401,Leonard,All? In particle physics twenty five is Woodstock.
33402,Leonard,Careful if you don’t get it all it’ll only come back worse.
33403,Howard,True but thanks to meditation I am able to stay in the same room with them without urinating. Now close your eyes.
33404,Sheldon,Plus I get to hang out with him again at the hearing. This is going to look great hanging next to my restraining order from Leonard Nimoy.
33405,Sheldon,Studies have shown that performing tasks such as eating talking on a cell phone or drinking coffee while driving reduces one’s reaction time by the same factor as an ounce of alcohol.
33406,Sheldon,Oh thank you.
33407,Penny,Studying abroad?
33408,Raj,You guys made a person.
33409,Penny,He won’t leave he says he’s afraid he’ll pass out on the bus and someone will harvest his organs.
33410,Sheldon,Actually that helps thank you.
33411,Sheldon,Amy I can’t just ask Wil Wheaton to leave. He’s a minor celebrity. Once you explain who he is many people recognize him.
33412,Penny,I’m starting to see why you and your mom aren’t very close.
33413,Leonard,Don’t even! I don’t want to hear another word out of you.
33414,Penny,We didn’t.
33415,Sheldon,But Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.
33416,Howard,What difference does it make? Fat is fat.
33417,Penny,What?
33418,Howard,Very nice. You lie to my sister.
33419,Sheldon,Yeah right. You can just shut your feelings off. There goes television lying to us again. We let you raise our children and this is the thanks we get. Leonard how could I have been so foolish to try and follow in the footsteps of a made-up alien race with no emotions?
33420,Leonard,Well since he won’t take the bus and he’s too evolved to drive he decided it would be easier to just sleep in his office and shower in the radiation lab until I’m finished with my experiment.
33421,Sheldon,Leonard I platonically love you man but face it you’re a mess.
33422,Sheldon,Is that you Raj? I don’t recognize your edge.
33423,Leonard,I’m her friend I’m not going to take advantage of her vulnerability.
33424,Penny,I said I don’t want you to. I’m getting another drink.
33425,Sheldon,Yeah but not your books. Something they might enjoy. I kid of course. Big fan.
33427,Sheldon,Friends! It’s Words with Friends! Which Stephen Hawking and I officially are. Now all I need is a bunk bed with a slide I’ll have everything I’ve ever wanted since I was six years old.
33428,Penny,Hey Sheldon you’re always full of fun little facts. Where did the expression got your ass handed to you come from?
33429,Howard,Did he respond yet?
33430,Sheldon,Be there in a minute. I just have to pre-soak these.
33431,Leonard,It’s sweet that he thinks there’s a story.
33432,Sheldon,I can’t find that quote on the Internet. Did you make that up?
33433,Sheldon,Right.  Penny. Are you going to answer the door or should I open it and say aha again?
33434,Leonard,Oh teacher! Me! Me!
33435,Sheldon,You know when my honour is insulted and I need to challenge someone to a duel by slapping them across the face with my glove.
33436,Leonard,Just sit down and eat.
33437,Leonard,I wouldn’t expect you to. I’ll see you later.
33438,Sheldon,Oh Shelly? A man’s here to take you away to the future. Be sure to pack clean underwear.
33439,Sheldon,Bye-bye
33440,Penny,Bug report When a guy asks me to spend time with him maybe he plans something a little more interesting than hanging out at home watching TV.
33441,Penny,I scraped gum off the bottom of that table. Only ’cause my manager saw me put it there.
33442,Sheldon,Although copyright law would allow me to quote snippets in the context of a review.
33443,Howard,Why do you have to make everything so filthy? Why couldn’t you just say the blog is like her giving me the key to her heart?
33444,Howard,Oh. You know what? I’m gonna let them know that I’m here with you and that they’re busted.
33445,Penny,I uh huh.
33446,Penny,Yes.
33447,Raj,That’s incredible. Oh here break out the math.
33448,Penny,Really?
33449,Sheldon,I remember it distinctly because I had just composed my annual poem commemorating the anniversary of Dr. Seuss’s death.
33450,Raj,Guys before this gets ugly remember the winner gets Sheldon.
33451,Leonard,I think she knows what I meant.
33452,Howard,Ooh big talk from a man who was once treed by a chicken.
33453,Sheldon,Fair enough. What stake do you propose?
33454,Sheldon,Are you up-to-date on Game of Thrones?
33455,Leonard,Do you mind? I’m questioning a lot of things in my life right now.
33456,Penny,Yeah you know what she is my mother-in-law and I’d like for us to have a good relationship.
33457,Penny,Why not?
33458,Howard,You’re kidding.
33459,Leonard,What about a game of tag on a French schoolyard?
33460,Leonard,Oh are you still going to spend the night?
33461,Leonard,No everything’s fine.
33462,Penny,Okay. Were you talking before she got upset?
33463,Sheldon,No go ahead say it. I know what it is. I’ve heard it my whole life. The word’s annoying. Go ahead say it. Say it. Say I’m annoying.
33464,Raj,Wait your your mother is sleeping with your dentist?
33465,Raj,Okay I see where this is going. Fine I’ll have sex with him.
33466,Penny,I get that okay? It’s just Leonard and I have been married for two years and we’re no further along than when we were dating.
33467,Howard,It’s not superstition. It’s practically Newtonian. For every action there’s an equal and opposite reaction. Leonard pretends to be a friend and acts like a two-faced bitch therefore he is reborn as a banana slug. It’s actually a very elegant system you know what goes around comes around.
33468,Howard,I I don’t know if you remember me.
33469,Howard,Oh come on we could share a pretzel and get sideways glances from racist old ladies.
33470,Sheldon,Well Stephanie since Leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball I guess I’ll just have to pick it up. Have you ever witnessed a violent crime?
33471,Sheldon,All right. Let’s play Physics Fiesta.
33472,Penny,What you writing there?
33473,Sheldon,Five more minutes.
33474,Leonard,Excuse me.
33475,Sheldon,Yeah well I knocked on the front door but you didn’t hear it.
33477,Sheldon,My bad. I did send a gift from both of us.
33478,Raj,Calm down okay? Try not to think about it.
33479,Penny,I doubt it.
33480,Penny,I’m gonna go.
33481,Leonard,Nothing it’s what’s wrong with him.
33482,Raj,Holy crap.
33483,Raj,That’s very mature of you.
33484,Leonard,I don’t think you can do both.
33485,Leonard,You want to make plans for New Years.
33486,Howard,Yeah but now you make me wonder what’s wrong with you.
33487,Sheldon,Only nine more months to comic-con.
33488,Sheldon,Since I rarely hug I’m relying on your expertise regarding duration.
33489,Sheldon,I’m the child she was worried about? I have a brother and sister whose combined intellectual wattage couldn’t power a potato clock if I spotted them the potato.
33490,Raj,Oh my God. She’s not gonna bathe me is she?
33491,Raj,If I don’t call her I won’t hear the end of it from my parents.
33492,Raj,That’s wonderful. A lawyer my sister’s a lawyer. Look at that we have something in common.
33493,Leonard,Okay how do I look?
33494,Raj,But e-excuse me I have something to say. None of you may realize it but I was very much looking forward to this weekend. It was gonna be like the old days the four of us hanging out playing video games before you guys all got girlfriends. Do you have any idea what it’s like to be the only one without a girlfriend? Even if I get one someday I’ll still be the guy who got a girl after Sheldon Cooper!
33495,Leonard,We’ve had this planned for a week.
33496,Penny,I tried making it better he wouldn’t go for it.
33497,Leonard,It’s in a FedEx box on its way back to where it came from.
33498,Howard,Thanks for skipping the movie. I couldn’t sit in that theatre for two hours wondering about Emily and that guy.
33499,Leonard,I’m still tweaking things a little bit but this will give you the general idea of the Web site. So what do you guys think?
33500,Sheldon,Leonard wait. Take me with you.
33501,Sheldon,But once you open the box you’ve voided the warranty. The warranty is a sacred covenant we’ve entered into with the manufacturer. He offers to stand by his equipment and we in return agree not to violate the integrity of the internal hardware. This little orange sticker is all that stands between us and anarchy.
33502,Raj,You want a real challenge try keeping me from eating more of these.
33503,Sheldon,I can see that. I was providing you with an alternative. A courtesy I was never offered in similar circumstances.
33504,Sheldon,Maybe that’s because I’m not being challenged. It’s the same reason Einstein failed math.
33505,Sheldon,Oh really? Since meeting her what have been your greatest accomplishments?
33506,Leonard,Oh. Okay. Thank you.
33507,Leonard,Well what if we go around the university and just get the patent ourselves?
33508,Sheldon,Apparently perfect attendance isn’t cool any more.
33509,Sheldon,What?
33510,Penny,Well I know he didn’t cheat on you so what happened?
33511,Penny,Okay. 
33512,Howard,Do you think he’s building a bomb?
33513,Penny,Okay well if you find him use the kitchen island that coffee table will not support both of you.
33514,Leonard,Well hey I’m just as much fun as you are.
33515,Leonard,Okay the X10s are online.
33516,Leonard,No it is not yours. We all went in on the box together.
33517,Sheldon,Trying to use a Jedi mind trick to control Stephen Hawking. Play. Play. Ugh! He must be wearing a tinfoil hat or something.
33518,Raj,I don’t see why not.
33519,Sheldon,Exactly.
33520,Leonard,Yeah.
33521,Raj,Ready for lunch?
33522,Howard,We haven’t had a good invisible man in a while.
33523,Penny,Oh um I should probably get going.
33524,Leonard,Leonard Sheldon.
33525,Leonard,That is insane.
33526,Leonard,Come on Barry there’s a Swedish team trying to run our experiment before us. Can’t you spare any?
33527,Leonard,Okay Sheldon I know I was supposed to return this DVD a long time ago and I know we rented it on your card. But it’s been like seven years and clearly nothing bad has happened. So in-in-in-instead of being a giant pain in the ass like you always are what if this one time you just tried staying calm?
33528,Howard,I was sleeping.
33529,Raj,And just so you know it’s only temporary. I’m not gonna get too comfortable.
33531,Leonard,Hey. I mean it’s been a little tough but Penny’s following her dreams and in my book that is not depressing.
33532,Raj,Are you kidding? He made me sign a waiver participate in an emergency fire drill and take a refresher course in CPR. Thank God he had a dummy.
33533,Leonard,Oh uh he’s crazy.
33534,Leonard,No-one’s going to ask if I spent the night with Raj’s sister.
33535,Sheldon,Why?
33536,Howard,Totally you.
33537,Raj,Oh sweet Krishna shake it that-a rupee maker.
33538,Sheldon,I like The Transformers. Do you like The Transformers?
33539,Raj,Thank you Penny.
33540,Raj,Oh no no I get a say in it. But I’m sure whoever shows up will be better company than a threesome I’ve been having with Aunt Jemima and Mrs Butterworth.
33541,Penny,Uh no I actually came to talk to you.
33542,Howard,Almost. Oh what did you put as the one-word description of yourself?
33543,Penny,Thank you.
33544,Raj,Are you sure you want to do this? Give up your half of the 3-D printer?
33545,Sheldon,No thank you.
33546,Leonard,What about you Stuart? You have a girlfriend yet?
33547,Sheldon,Well put. You know I must say I go back and forth on this boyfriend-girlfriend thing but those moments when you worship me really keep you in the running.
33548,Howard,While I’m gone you can think about how mean you were to me.
33549,Penny,Oh don’t feel bad. I never read Leonard’s and I used to sleep with him.
33550,Sheldon,Let’s take every single thing from the other apartment and put it in here.
33551,Leonard,That is ridiculous.
33552,Raj,Maybe you’re right. Wow I am easy to manipulate.  Oh guys it’s Emily. What should I do?
33553,Penny,Okay suit yourself. We’ll probably be trashing Priya a little.
33554,Sheldon,Oh. Oh now you know I hate change. Say it.
33555,Howard,Wait. Are we starting now? Or is that what you’re going to say when we do start or…
33556,Sheldon,Of course not.
33557,Leonard,None why?
33558,Leonard,Thank you Sheldon. That must’ve been very hard for you to say.
33560,Sheldon,You see where I’m going with this.
33561,Raj,Howard wait. Why don’t you use this instead of the PVC to keep the transverse filter assembly in place?
33562,Leonard,Really?
33564,Raj,Let’s go to the biology lab and find you some nice yummy mice.
33565,Sheldon,No she won’t. I’m great.
33566,Howard,It’ll be okay. It’ll be okay.  It’s Howard. Howard hello.
33567,Penny,Anything else I should know.
33568,Penny,Okay you know what? This is ridiculous. I’ve been trying to make a connection with you all day and clearly I’m getting nowhere.
33569,Howard,Later dude.
33570,Raj,Well that was rather unpleasant.
33571,Sheldon,Oh that’s very kind of you. But I’m sure you’ll all have a better time without me. Let’s go Stuart.
33572,Sheldon,No you can’t use that one. That’s mine. Uh try this one for an ice-breaker. Uh despite popular lore there is no place in the continental United States Alaska or Hawaii from which one can dig straight through the centre of the earth and come up in China.
33573,Raj,Sorry. Better?
33574,Sheldon,Not according to the work of Berscheid Snyder and Omoto.
33575,Howard,Thanks for coming with me.
33576,Raj,It wasn’t a pyjama party. It was just a couple of bros hanging out giggling eating cookie dough and watching Princess Bride.
33577,Sheldon,Yes in fact I am the youngest person ever to win it.
33578,Sheldon,Oh boy. You know ours is a relationship of the mind.
33579,Sheldon,Oh. Do not sneak up on a guy when he’s sitting on a log.
33580,Sheldon,Thank you.
33581,Howard,Now that everything’s out on the table you you think you two will keep living together?
33582,Sheldon,Fellow warriors this is Sheldor the Conqueror. We are about to enter Axel’s fortress. Now this is a long run so let’s do another bladder check. Alright Barry we’ll wait for you again but you really should see a doctor.  Penny are you experiencing some sort of difficulty?
33583,Sheldon,Just for the record my efforts to establish you as the alpha male were not aided by you bursting into tears.
33584,Sheldon,You went out in the hallway stumbled into an interdimensional portal which brought you 5000 years into the future where you took advantage of the advanced technology to build a time machine and now you’re back to bring us all with you to the year 7010 where we are transported to work at the thinkatorium by telepathically controlled flying dolphins?
33585,Sheldon,From the intercom.
33586,Sheldon,Are you sure?
33587,Sheldon,You know it’s like the baseball movie build it and they will come.
33588,Sheldon,Granted my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox but I think the end result will be a measurable enhancement of Penny’s quality of life.
33589,Leonard,It wasn’t fun for me.
33590,Leonard,Yeah I wanted to explain.
33591,Howard,Padma Kapur Neha Chowdury.
33592,Leonard,Uh I’m not sure everyone keep an eye on Howard in case he starts to swell up.
33593,Sheldon,No. Oh no. Now you call her Constance. I call her Meemaw. You have your own Meemaw. It’s not my fault she died when you were four.
33594,Sheldon,No more talking everybody go.
33595,Leonard,Okay I’m sorry. I’ll shut up.
33596,Raj,Hey Emily listen I’ve been thinking and I’m not sure it’s a good idea that I come over.
33597,Raj,The kite you made me lose was an authentic Patang an Indian fighting kite that my brother sent to me from New Delhi. It took me a day to put together and two days to paint. This is Hello Kitty.
33598,Leonard,You always get your way.
33599,Howard,All right. Imagine yourself in the one place you feel most at home. Where is that?
33600,Leonard,I’m sorry but facts are facts.
33601,Raj,No. It’s just one of those times when it’s just you and me. Like when the three of us went to the movies and you and I waited outside the bathroom while Howard threw up Red Vines and Cherry Coke. Do you remember that?
33602,Leonard,Chicken out. We’re we’re so afraid of getting into trouble that we never do anything wrong.
33603,Raj,Okay that’s a lot of money. The wise thing to do is invest it in something practical. Like a jet ski.
33604,Raj,Like who?
33605,Penny,Really? Great!
33606,Sheldon,Oh I’m hanging in there. Thanks for asking.
33607,Raj,I bet you told Bernadette all about how he was screwing around with Mandy Chao.
33608,Sheldon,That’s a risk I’m willing to take.
33609,Leonard,h  I love it. Oh that’s great!
33610,Penny,Really?
33611,Penny,Thank you.
33612,Sheldon,Excuse me. It’s Major Sheldon Cooper. With my last breath I awarded myself a battlefield promotion. It’s kind of a big deal.
33613,Leonard,Yeah that’s right.
33614,Penny,Well I’m going to take myself out to a movie tonight. You want to go?
33615,Penny,So where do you guys want to go dancing?
33616,Penny,Sleep.
33617,Sheldon,Is there a problem?
33618,Sheldon,Yes.
33619,Leonard,No!
33620,Penny,So you told her you wanted to slow things down?
33621,Sheldon,Give me back my parking space.
33622,Sheldon,In 1890 Emile Dolbear determined that there was a fixed relationship between the number of chirps per minute of the snowy tree cricket and the ambient temperature. A precise relationship that is not present with ordinary field crickets.
33623,Sheldon,First of all this has only made me stronger. But beyond that all I did was fill out an application.
33624,Raj,Great. It’s not like I brought it up because I wanted to go.
33625,Penny,Are you sure? He’s small. I bet I can get a nice tight spiral on him.
33626,Leonard,I forget. Which one is Hammer of the Gods?
33627,Penny,Cleaning up is not young and fun.
33628,Sheldon,Check.
33629,Sheldon,It’s a little stiff. What a remarkably fragile structure to support such a valuable payload. Not unlike balancing a Faberge egg on a Pixie Stick.
33630,Raj,It’s all over her Facebook page.
33631,Leonard,Okay I’ll give you one more clue. It involved another person.
33632,Raj,Wouldn’t you be upset if you saw Amy out with someone else?
33633,Leonard,So you’re looking to ruin something for her in the funny pages?
33634,Sheldon,My plan was to jump out at the state line but one of my nose plugs fell into the toilet.
33635,Raj,Uh so forgive me forgive me for being nosy but is is there a wedding ring under those pretty rubber gloves?
33636,Raj,Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz is requested to report to the NASA Johnson Space Center Houston Texas for astronaut training Monday eight a.m.
33637,Leonard,Oh people get things they don’t deserve all the time. Look at me with you.
33638,Sheldon,Well I’m sorry but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret so that I could choose whether or not I wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping. You can’t impose a secret on an ex post facto basis.
33639,Penny,Wow. I can drink a beer underwater.
33640,Sheldon,Thank you. Yeah I’ll bear that in mind if I’m ever nominated for the Hillbilly Peace Prize.
33641,Sheldon,I did it! I actually did it. Okay now flush him.
33643,Penny,What were you doing with rocket fuel in your apartment?
33644,Leonard,Uh please understand that it’s not that we don’t want you around but Penny and I occasionally need some alone time.
33645,Leonard,Leslie. I can’t remember the last time we talked. So much has changed.
33646,Raj,How’d you do?
33647,Sheldon,Then it must be a tumour.
33648,Sheldon,Munching on complimentary popcorn. Woot woot. Oh the gall. I hope his next tweet is popcorn lodged in trachea choking to death woot woot.
33649,Leonard,What are you doing?
33650,Leonard,Oh please we’ve spent our whole lives running away from fights. Personally I can squeeze through a hole in a fence half my size.
33651,Howard,All I’m saying is there’s a time to just listen.
33652,Leonard,Right. Sorry sir.
33653,Penny,Ooh! What’s going on in here?
33654,Leonard,Ah interesting we’re being accused of making you do things you don’t like and here you are doing the same thing to poor Amy.
33655,Howard,You know what? Even though I don’t have a girlfriend I can still have a good time on Valentine’s Day.
33656,Howard,Nothing bad happens in The Lake House.
33657,Sheldon,You don’t think that will be awkward?
33658,Raj,A friend at the School of Pharmacology gave me these new pills they’re testing. He says it’s the next big thing for social anxiety disorder.
33659,Sheldon,Well Howard thank you. It’s quite a gesture on your part. You’ve shown yourself to be the bigger man.
33660,Sheldon,She stiffed you?
33661,Leonard,Yeah I got the same one. And that’s not a bathing suit it’s a tan line.
33662,Sheldon,In my defence I prefaced that by saying “with all due respect.”
33664,Sheldon,It’s hard to say. I’ve never really lived by myself. What if I become strange and eccentric?
33665,Penny,Okay you can have that one.
33666,Leonard,All right Mother. Um have a nice flight.
33667,Sheldon,What did I do?
33668,Raj,Oh good. Um can I tell people that our love burned too bright and too quickly? Kind of a Candle in the Wind deal?
33669,Sheldon,Yeah the point is Higgs is being celebrated for work he did 50 years ago so that got me thinking perhaps I’ve already hit upon the idea that will win me my Nobel prize.
33670,Leonard,A little until I saw them in matching tops.
33671,Sheldon,You need to remove that chair from the building. It’s a health hazard.
33672,Sheldon,I don’t know. What if living together kills the romance?
33673,Sheldon,No that doesn’t seem any more likely.
33674,Leonard,Well what do you want to do?
33675,Raj,You are because dating two women I mean I can’t even remember the last time I slept in my own apartment. I wake up and I’m like am I at Claire’s or am I at Emily’s? Is there a third girl I’ve forgotten about? Like where am I?
33676,Penny,Oh gee well thankyou for that. But um I think for now Leonard and I are just going to stay friends.
33677,Leonard,Uh-uh.
33678,Sheldon,Who? Give me their names. I bet it’s Wolowitz.
33679,Leonard,Oh can’t you take the bus to the dentist?
33680,Howard,I wonder if he’s listening to our music right now.
33681,Howard,Sure of course. Oh actually Emily was gonna spend the night.
33682,Sheldon,And now as promised the tangent. Sheldon and the Hell Hound or How I Lost My Hot Dogs.
33684,Howard,Oh right. Good one.
33685,Leonard,Well I want to go get my asthma inhaler but it might ruin the moment. Just just help me out here. How does a miserable date end in sex?
33686,Sheldon,I’m Sheldon. How do you do?
33687,Leonard,There is an inherent ambiguity in the word dinner. Technically it refers to the largest meal of the day whenever it is consumed so to clarify here by dinner I mean supper.
33688,Raj,And I like to think I helped.
33689,Howard,Hey guys.
33690,Leonard,Sure.
33691,Howard,Lucy?
33692,Sheldon,This isn’t a desk. This is a Brobdingnagian monstrosity.
33693,Penny,Aw he has the same look my little nephew gets when he can’t figure out how I got his nose.
33694,Leonard,But you made me order it because you were too well-known in the flag community and they’d jack up the price.
33695,Raj,You got me. Now what are you going to do with me?
33696,Howard,Don’t you see? When we’re all having fun together we’re already winners. Oh look. See? Even I’m a winner.
33697,Sheldon,I’m fine. Although I’m no longer the master of my own bladder.
33698,Raj,To be truthful Emily and I haven’t dated that long and we never agreed to be exclusive to each other.
33699,Leonard,Door. 
33700,Raj,What?
33701,Raj,So I guess what I’m saying is I get where Lucy’s coming from.
33702,Sheldon,So Leonard how are you enjoying Anything Can Happen Thursday?
33703,Raj,Wait you don’t remember?
33704,Howard,And that’s not even the best part. See? I have one too. Check it out. You can wear yours and we can have little sword fights whenever we want.
33705,Penny,Say the quote again.
33706,Sheldon,Not at all.
33707,Howard,Whatever dude. The point is Leonard’s got one and you don’t.
33708,Penny,Hey Bernadette’s water broke.
33709,Leonard,And I doubt the military would be interested in our little guidance system.
33710,Sheldon,Not true. Wil thinks this is a great idea. He was just concerned that he wasn’t a big enough celebrity to headline such an amazing event. Also that’s the same day that he shampoos his beard.
33711,Raj,A lane frequented by liars. Like you you big liar.
33712,Howard,Thank you.
33713,Howard,I hadn’t spoken to Emily since I broke up with her and she left this on my doorstep with a note.
33714,Howard,Thank you.
33715,Howard,Oh man. Scooter sucks. He’s the Aquaman of the Muppet Babies.
33716,Sheldon,No problem. I’ll be back before this banana hits the ground. Zoom zoom zoom zoom! Zoom zoom zoom zoom!
33717,Sheldon,Hey fellas I’m thinking about making some freshly brewed iced tea if anyone would like some.
33718,Howard,But Sheldon we don’t have a chance. The only improvement you were able to make on the robot was to put fresh batteries in the remote.
33719,Sheldon,Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs they are no more alike than any other siblings.
33720,Howard,Wow. You’re not only our first astronaut. You’re also the first one of us to kick a girl out of bed. You’re like a rock star.
33721,Howard,Oh too bad. I’ve always wanted to go to Long Beach.
33722,Sheldon,If you don’t mind I’d like to stop listening to you and start talking.
33723,Raj,One more time?
33724,Raj,Yeah okay Howard wins.
33725,Leonard,He was 84 he’d say where’s my pudding?
33726,Penny,Come on Sheldon let’s go home. Look we’re done fighting.
33727,Raj,Hey you’re just in time. We made Tex-Mex.
33728,Howard,Okay. Ooh perhaps today is the day we finally find out what’s inside the Magic Eight Ball.
33729,Sheldon,Oh but I am. Didn’t Penny tell you the good news?
33730,Leonard,Alright.
33731,Howard,Come on guys! Hurry up! Hurry up!
33732,Sheldon,Which means his triumph will be even larger. Minstrels will write songs about him.
33733,Penny,Nothing. Let’s go to the party.  How do I look?
33734,Leonard,Fine then you go.
33735,Howard,Good morning everybody. I picked up coffee while I was out. Bernadette here’s your soy peppermint mocha.
33736,Leonard,Hang on. Looks like everyone’s a winner.
33737,Penny,Howard do you think maybe sometimes you try too hard?
33738,Penny,I would not.
33739,Leonard,What’s the emergency?
33740,Penny,Oh. Good for you.
33741,Raj,But she did dump you.
33742,Raj,Maybe you don’t want someone exactly like you. You know what they say opposites attract.
33743,Raj,Ooh. Leonard’s going all alpha nerd on Sheldon’s ass.
33744,Penny,No. 
33745,Penny,Okay look I didn’t want to say this but the real reason I took the painting down was because it made Bernadette very jealous.
33746,Leonard,Smooth.
33747,Penny,Okay be nice.
33748,Penny,Oh wow that’s so sweet. Hey what’s this?
33749,Sheldon,And send.
33750,Penny,Okay instead of protecting me why don’t you try being excited when something good happens?
33751,Leonard,Or maybe she’ll finally succeed in ripping my nuts off. There are still 93 ways she hasn’t tried yet. Look Howard I appreciate the effort but this is like the worst date of my life.
33752,Leonard,Well we’re going to go apologise to Raj and invite him out to dinner.
33753,Penny,Well the night is still young.
33754,Sheldon,Einstein.
33755,Howard,Well I thought… Come on I didn’t want anyone to feel bad at the end of the game. And some of those puzzles were really hard and I didn’t know who was gonna get Penny.
33756,Sheldon,All right. It was hell.
33757,Penny,Yeah probably.
33758,Sheldon,It’s like there’s a train in your mouth. Howard Oh yeah. I’ve got one. Um the Amtrak Wolverine coming into Chicago. Bwch-wch-wch-wch-wch-wch bwch-wch-wch-wch-wch-wch. Ooo-ooo.
33759,Sheldon,Uh I do. Uh does this train car have the original link-and-pin coupler or the Miller Hook and Platform?
33760,Leonard,Wait wait. What?
33761,Raj,I I don’t know if you remember me.
33762,Raj,If you want we could tell you.
33763,Raj,Well my feelings were real when he was about to die.
33764,Leonard,Oh hang on a second. 
33765,Penny,Okay it’s not a movie. It’s improv. So no one calls action.
33766,Sheldon,In fact you did but I was referring to Howard.
33767,Sheldon,Well actually insects are a dietary staple in many cultures they’re almost pure protein.
33768,Raj,I didn’t bring it up. You did.
33769,Howard,That’s why I got you hot chocolate.
33770,Leonard,Well you shouldn’t.
33771,Sheldon,Oh gee I don’t know. My schedule’s a little busy.
33772,Sheldon,What’s it doing in my apartment?
33773,Penny,Hey what’s with all the yelling?
33774,Sheldon,I don’t know but if you don’t figure something out I warn you I shall become very difficult to live with.
33775,Raj,Man call spoiler alert before you say things like that.
33776,Sheldon,Aha! The tear-stained air mattress in the back of the van.
33777,Howard,Okay so once we receive the next image and compare it to the ones we’ve already collected we’ll know what it is that we found.
33778,Leonard,Sure.
33779,Leonard,Oh yeah there he is.
33780,Sheldon,Oh I’ll check Amazon.
33781,Leonard,Thank you.
33782,Raj,Ooh that is a lot of hair. Ow. And now I’m gonna hear it from Jenny.
33783,Howard,So what do you guys think that’s about?
33784,Raj,Uh off. And on. And the Oprah Network. This is so much better than watching TV like a muggle.
33785,Penny,Hey you guys ready to order or you need a few minutes?
33786,Leonard,How teeny tiny?
33787,Howard,When I call him his phone plays Brown Eyed Girl. Which now that I think about it is not so good.
33788,Penny,Both of us.
33789,Penny,Yeah I said I’d think about it.
33790,Raj,I never said that.
33791,Howard,Damn it. I had Lysine and changed it.
33792,Penny,Oh sweetie you should really get some money.
33793,Howard,Oh please show me a ten-year-old who knows to dip Tootsie Rolls in Nutella.
33794,Sheldon,You know I think I may have misjudged this restaurant.
33795,Penny,Oh my God.
33796,Raj,Okay now you’re talking like a winner!
33797,Penny,Oh sweetie just forget about it.
33798,Penny,Hey you ready to go?
33799,Sheldon,We’re all out of alcohol.
33800,Leonard,Seriously? You don’t even have a change of clothes or a toothbrush.
33801,Raj,Who wouldn’t? You could zip through a maze in nothing flat squeeze through really small holes and shut down restaurants in a single bound. And the best part is if I were Rat-Man you could be my sidekick Mouse Boy.
33802,Sheldon,And you’re going to let her handle my food?
33803,Leonard,What are you doing?
33804,Sheldon,This is the beginning of a twenty six hundred year journey we’re going to take together from the ancient Greeks through Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr to Erwin Schrodinger to the Dutch researchers that Leonard is currently ripping off.
33805,Penny, Sheldon.
33806,Penny,Sure.
33807,Penny,Thanks. What are you guys doing?
33808,Sheldon,Really? Where’s your friend Justin going to sleep?
33809,Howard,Why?
33810,Howard,He’s got him there. The D even stands for department.
33811,Leonard,Hey great news. The TV I want will fit in the gaming room and if I leave the curtains open I can watch it from work.
33812,Howard,Here comes Kripke!
33813,Penny,Come on Amy show us the dress.
33814,Leonard,Really? Brent Spiner Mr. Data himself. You love him.
33815,Penny,Aw so cute when you use the word cool wrong. Like when kids say pasghetti.
33817,Penny,I don’t get it.
33818,Penny,Oh just a little treat. I know you’ve been feeling really bad about your mom lately.
33819,Sheldon,You’re not going to answer it?
33820,Leonard,I’ve gotten a lot better at that you know. I’ve dated four different women since we broke up and I didn’t tell any of them that I loved them and wanted to have their babies.
33821,Leonard,I wonder where Dr. Lorvis is. He’s been gone a while.
33822,Howard,Fine then I guess it’s two against two. How do we decide?
33823,Raj,Yes.
33824,Leonard,What you actually want to meet her?
33825,Penny,So coke.
33826,Penny,Sheldon look I will pay you back as soon as I can. You just have to give me more time.
33827,Sheldon,This is great. Look at me out in the real world of ordinary people just living their ordinary colourless workaday lives.
33828,Penny,Okay wait you’re inviting people to our wedding?
33829,Sheldon,Night of the Living Garlic Bread?
33830,Leonard,We don’t mean to interrupt we live across the hall.
33831,Penny,Damn.
33832,Sheldon,Texas.
33833,Sheldon,Oh I’m sorry condescending means…
33834,Leonard,Uh cut it in half?
33835,Leonard,Of course she did. Anyway that’s not what I was gonna say. When I was ten years old I built a hugging machine.
33836,Sheldon,Yeh why? Eh why? Oh that’s why.
33837,Raj,Holy crap! Look!
33838,Penny,Sure.
33839,Howard,You always do this you know? You ditch me for a woman you don’t have a shot with.
33840,Leonard,Is everything all right?
33841,Penny,Oh that is so thoughtful.
33842,Leonard,No. We just made out a little.
33843,Raj,Excuse me I’m meeting a girl here. It’s kind of our first date.
33844,Leonard,All right problem solved.
33845,Raj,We were having a conversation about past lovers.
33846,Leonard,It’s not that big a deal. You just go down to the court on Thursday and you pay the fine.
33847,Sheldon,It bothers me.
33848,Penny,You don’t have to worry. Unlike Amy and Priya I know how to keep a secret.
33849,Penny,Eight o’clock.  Sheldon that pocket watch is ridiculous.
33850,Leonard,You have a new job.
33851,Penny,Sheldon I cooked you breakfast. I made your bed. I checked your mouth for thrush. You can rub your own chest.
33852,Sheldon,Yes. That is the reason. My work is suffering because of all the laid I’m getting.
33854,Penny,Thank you Stuart. It’s nice to know.
33855,Howard,What… what kind of a kiss?
33856,Leonard,Come on I’m sorry.
33857,Raj,How are your crab cakes?
33859,Penny,I felt sorry for him. Priya’s giving him a hard time.
33860,Howard,We don’t have any of those.
33861,Raj,Or totally naked. I love Howard but the dude needs a little shame.
33862,Penny,Why they’re just toys?
33863,Sheldon,Well of course but not by myself.
33864,Sheldon,On the contrary you no longer get to enjoy my charming eccentricities. We’re not friends with benefits.
33865,Leonard,Penny started taking a class. She wrote a paper she didn’t want me to read it I went behind her back and I read it anyway.
33866,Penny,Bernadette told me everything. Now you don’t get the left or the right.
33867,Penny,Do I like it? Wow.
33868,Leonard,Oh would you stop worrying about that?
33869,Howard,Oh if it’s even the U.S. Military. It could be foreign military pretending to be American.
33870,Sheldon,But you didn’t even hear the details.
33871,Penny,Oh come on they don’t hate you all right? They’re just a little intimidated. All you need to do is show everyone how sweet you really are.
33872,Sheldon,Yeah.
33873,Sheldon,And I’m sorry I lied about being a wedding planner who can’t find love. Although I am currently single if you know anybody.
33874,Sheldon,No.
33876,Sheldon,All right you’ve made your point. A fine prank very amusing. Now get it out.
33878,Sheldon,Don’t be silly. I’m a fan of anything that tries to replace actual human contact.
33879,Sheldon,Oh I don’t know. But whoever that mystery man was you should be eternally grateful for without him there would be no Leonard’s Day.
33880,Howard,I bet it is. Why don’t women like me?
33881,Sheldon,Right games. They took Halo 1 Halo 2 Halo 3 Call of Duty 1 Call of Duty 2 Call of Duty 3 Rock Band Rock Band 2 Final Fantasy 1 thru 9 The Legend of Zelda The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess Super Mario Brothers Super Mario Galaxy Mario and Sonic at the Winter Olympics and Ms. Pacman.
33882,Howard,Well maybe there’s a way to appear non-aggressive but also be able to protect ourselves if necessary. Like smiling and waving with one hand but the other hand holding the severed head of a tiger.
33883,Sheldon,It’s after nine o’clock at this hour the streets of Pasadena are teeming with drunken sailors and alley cats.
33884,Sheldon,Pacific Daylight time!
33885,Raj,You got it.
33886,Sheldon,You know I do recall seeing some female undergarments. Where was that? Oh yes earlier this evening I happened to gaze out the window and a brassiere caught my eye. Do those look familiar?
33887,Howard,That was before Penny. I make it a rule to only fall for one of my friends’ girlfriends at a time. I’m very old-fashioned that way.
33888,Sheldon, Amy?
33889,Penny,Oh my God what happened?
33890,Howard,Oh that’s a nice one. Was it yours when you were little?
33891,Howard,You know I just read a study that suggests new mothers are better at sensing emotions for up to two years.
33892,Sheldon,It was Thanksgiving. Uncle Carl said I think there’s a badger living in our chimney. Hand me that flashlight. Those were the last words he ever spoke to us.
33893,Raj,I’m sorry for bothering you. I’ll hang up now.
33894,Sheldon,From an orang-u-tan in the primate lab.
33895,Leonard,Not you. I wasn’t asking you. Penny?
33896,Sheldon,Can we trust him?
33897,Sheldon,Cluck-cluck-cluck.
33898,Sheldon,Any group big enough to trample me to death. General rule of thumb is 36 adults or 70 children.
33899,Howard,Or maybe he heard it’s Tator Tot Tuesday. That’s why I’m here.
33900,Sheldon,Leonard sleeps while I play bongos.
33901,Leonard,Yeah that too. Everything’s broken.
33902,Penny,See this is where everything goes wrong when we talk.
33904,Penny,Really? Well then will you explain it to me?
33905,Sheldon,Seventeen. The ogre is amused by your joke and allows you to pass. By the by I liked it too.
33906,Howard,intoxicating isn’t it?
33907,Sheldon,What and let him win? Do I look crazy to you? We’re trying to think down here you geode-loving feldspar jockeys!  And you the notes are C D E G and A. You pick one or I am chopping down that tree!
33908,Sheldon,Kumquat?
33909,Howard,Which part?
33910,Leonard,This is just half? We’ve been here for hours.
33911,Howard,We don’t get paid? Nothing? Not even a sandwich?
33912,Howard,Oh oh uh you could uh stand outside his window with a boom box in the air.
33913,Sheldon,I don’t know the future. Do you think there’s a chance that an asteroid could hit the Earth destroying Feynman’s house and everyone in it?
33914,Leonard,Well good for you buddy. We’ll let you get back in there.
33915,Howard,It was our first date there was an awkward silence. What was I supposed to say?
33916,Penny,Like there’s a difference.
33917,Leonard,We lived together 13 years. How can you be so awful to me?
33918,Sheldon,That’s a lot of money for only one colour.
33919,Penny,Oh.
33920,Leonard,I don’t know. She already thinks I don’t support this so if I call it might look like I’m checking up on her.
33921,Sheldon,I’m not a child. I know the word ninny.
33922,Sheldon,Fine I’ll do it.
33923,Leonard,All right Pictionary. What are the teams?
33924,Sheldon,I’m glad you asked. I took the liberty of adapting a Star Trek fan fiction novella I wrote when I was ten into a one-act play.
33925,Penny,Wow. I-I don’t know what to s… Wow.
33926,Sheldon,Apparently I called Stephen Hawking last night.
33927,Sheldon,Three months. This is gonna be great!
33928,Howard,I’m not an alcoholic.
33929,Leonard,I’m glad you had a nice time with Amy.
33930,Sheldon,Thank you. If you think about it Greek food isn’t that far from italian food. They share a spice palette. And what a civilization is the Greeks. They gave us science democracy and little cubes of charred meat that taste like sweat.
33931,Sheldon,Morning.
33932,Penny,No. Yeah. But you know what the second-worst part is? He does not miss me at all.
33933,Sheldon,Excuse me. Thirty what under thirty what to watch what?
33934,Sheldon,I was not thinking it. Although now that you point it out it is undeniable.
33936,Sheldon,It’s not yours? Oh my. How embarrassing for both of us.
33937,Leonard,What.  Howard brought a date?
33938,Sheldon,Come on Leonard if you roll a six Penny dies horribly in a nuclear meltdown. See what I mean when I say the fun is real?
33939,Leonard,So by friend do you mean friend friend gay friend or ex boyfriend who you’re now platonic with but still might have a thing for you friend”?
33940,Penny,Yeah.
33941,Penny,Yeah you wrote it on my hand.
33942,Howard,Okay. Okay you’re right. It’s time for me to step up and take responsibility for my life. Be a man.  Hello Mummy.
33943,Leonard,I’m okay. Just a little mouthwash and then I’m gonna rock your world. 
33944,Penny,Once again unbelievable.
33945,Sheldon,What if I told you that over the past few months Amy has secretly been giving you little puzzles to test your intelligence against chimpanzees in her lab?
33946,Penny,Actually I’m at The Cheesecake Factory.
33947,Raj,That’s okay. I can come back later.
33948,Sheldon,Actually he can. The Hindu Code of Manu is very clear in these matters. If a woman’s father is not around the duty of controlling her base desires falls to the closest male member of her family in this case Raj. The code also states that if she disobeys she will be reborn in the womb of a jackal and tormented by diseases. If true that seems like an awfully large gamble given that the prize is Leonard.
33949,Penny,Bite me!
33950,Raj,Hey Leonard did you see my limo downstairs.
33951,Leonard,Yes.
33952,Penny,Howard and Bernadette’s kid might be born on your birthday. How cool is that?
33953,Penny,Yeah.
33954,Howard,Can we take a moment to discuss that I just lied to the government for you?
33955,Sheldon,All right colour me intrigued.
33956,Sheldon,Yes I’m inviting people to our wedding. Yeah I’ve already asked Stephen Hawking and Robert Downey Jr and now don’t get your hopes up ’cause he’s pretty busy but Erno Rubik.
33957,Leonard,Terrific. Um this party is my first chance for Penny to see me in the context of her social group and I need you not to embarrass me tonight.
33958,Penny,No but if things don’t work out with me and Leonard I’ll give you a call. Wait. How much do you talk about Star Trek?
33959,Howard,Is that a real book? I would totally read that book.
33960,Sheldon,Wait. I just want you all to know that I forgive you. This mutiny isn’t your fault it’s mine. I haven’t earned these bars. Although what I lack in leadership apparently I more than make up for in sewing.
33961,Penny,Oh dad that’s nice but Leonard has to work. Right Leonard?
33962,Penny,Wow centrifugal force!
33963,Sheldon,No I crossed in the middle of the street. And normally I wouldn’t but I saw an aggressive-looking Girl Scout and it was the heart of cookie season. Anyway there was a police officer and he witnessed the whole thing.
33964,Raj,I’m just saying that after everything you’ve been through you get to look into each other’s eyes and say “I love you.” And that’s beautiful.
33965,Sheldon,Yeah I know. They called it the greatest thing since the Communist party. Although I’m pretty sure that the Communist party made them say that. I like China. See they know how to keep people in line.
33966,Sheldon,Koo from Koothrappali and per from Cooper.
33967,Sheldon,My point is we’re a couple and I like you for who you are quirks and all.
33968,Penny,No. Sheldon we’re getting married.
33969,Howard,No way Jose.
33970,Leonard,Nobody’s up in anybody’s business let’s just buy our stuff and go.
33971,Penny,I feel bad for whoever gets that phone call.
33972,Sheldon,Not just a sticker. That is a sticker of a kitty saying me-wow.
33973,Leonard,Ah!
33975,Howard,Hi. I’m good. Really good. Well I don’t know why I said really good. I’m just regular good. I really just wanted to sound confident. And that really was a real really not a fake really like the first really.
33976,Penny,Oh yeah you too.
33977,Penny,Here.
33978,Sheldon,Seriously. I feel like I’ve got a fish tank in my pelvis.
33979,Sheldon,Thank you for carving a smiley face in my grilled cheese sandwich.
33980,Sheldon,Hello. Sorry I’m late. I also got you a balloon but it floated away and I chased it for a while.
33981,Sheldon,Right here. Use your finger.
33982,Penny,Is something bothering you?
33983,Leonard,It is.
33984,Howard,But you’re not Princess Punchali.
33985,Leonard,You got it. Well Penny might want to join us.
33986,Leonard,Okay okay. I’m gonna show you what’s in the box. But just promise not to flip out.
33987,Sheldon,Yes ma’am.
33988,Penny,Ding ding ding ding ding.
33989,Howard,With what?
33990,Penny,Oh what the hell. 
33991,Sheldon,Yeah and this one won’t stain my teeth purple.
33992,Raj,No you didn’t. There are millions of data points there.
33993,Leonard,Well what was the plan?
33994,Raj,Let me finish.
33995,Howard,They also don’t care for it if you stare at them and hyperventilate. Sadly that’s my home run swing.
33997,Penny,Don’t be silly.
33998,Raj,No but when I was six years old I tried to start a boy band called Frankie Goes to Bollywood. But I couldn’t get any other boys to join so my parents asked the servants to be my backup dancers. Wait when you sign servants don’t sign it like I’m bragging. Sign it in a way that I sound humble with just a hint of that’s right I had servants.
33999,Sheldon,I don’t care! I’m losin’ it man!
34000,Leonard,12 years after high school and I’m still at the nerd table.
34001,Penny,Okay well I’ve been poking around the internet and I think I found something we’ll enjoy watching even more.
34002,Raj,You were right. I can’t get out of here.
34003,Sheldon,April 12th 2005 Bob’s Big Boy Toluca Lake. Raj had just introduced us to Priya for the first time and she was enjoying the sweet taste of Hindu rebellion in the form of a Bob’s Super Big Boy hamburger. In order to preserve your friendship you and Howard made a pinky swear that neither of you would attempt to woo her. I had a patty melt.
34004,Sheldon,Do you have those little marshmallows?
34005,Sheldon,Here’s the problem. I was clearly signed up to use the mainframe in Buckman 204 and Dr Winkle just wantonly ripped the sign-up sheet off the wall.
34006,Leonard,Hey how were things on the set?
34007,Sheldon,There’s kissing in Star Trek smarty-pants.
34008,Leonard,I didn’t know what else to do he’s lost all focus every day he’s got a new obsession.  This is a particularly disturbing one.
34009,Raj,It’ll be okay. It’ll be okay.  It’s Howard. Howard hello.
34010,Sheldon,Did you meet anyone interesting there perhaps a promiscuous redheaded barmaid?
34011,Sheldon,Leonard explain it to her.
34012,Penny,Uh we were actually gonna do it here.
34013,Penny,Raj would you ever try an experiment like that with Emily?
34014,Leonard,Oh come on he’s just going to play with it twice and then it’ll end up in his closet with all the other junk.
34016,Penny,Yeah right.
34017,Sheldon,Now.
34018,Sheldon,What?
34020,Howard,Oh my pleasure and don’t worry about your presentation today. You’re gonna be great.
34021,Penny,No she won’t.
34022,Leonard,Wish I knew. He’s fine with Pluto.
34023,Penny,Hey guys this package came for y…
34024,Sheldon,See? We both think so.
34025,Leonard,And you thought they all had a silver lining.
34026,Howard,Are you sure?
34027,Sheldon,Good idea. And since you’ve had such a rough day I’m gonna let you throw the pie in Leonard’s face.
34028,Leonard,Good for you.
34029,Penny,Sheldon?
34030,Sheldon,Why are you speaking English?
34031,Leonard,I’m sorry what did I say?
34032,Raj,Uh yeah I mean her serve was pretty good.
34033,Penny,Okay for the final touch this is an eyelash curler. You just place it on your lashes and squeeze it closed.
34034,Raj,Come on Sheldon you got this.
34035,Howard,Is that a real thing?
34036,Leonard,Come on Raj we’re ready to start.
34037,Sheldon,Oh really? Okay well would a baby have to shave once every 11 days?
34038,Sheldon,Ah I do so love beverages. Now I think I’ll take my after-dinner walk.
34040,Sheldon,Who’s ready to laugh?
34041,Leonard,They seem okay with it.
34042,Howard,You know Tor the God of Tunder. As I was saying is this a sign that our society is approaching gender equality?
34043,Sheldon,That’s close enough.
34044,Leonard,What?
34045,Howard,Dark and fun.
34046,Leonard,Now now you denigrated the memory of a great civil rights pioneer. That’s all anyone could ask.
34047,Penny,Why do you people hate sleep? Are you wearing my robe?
34048,Sheldon,If Batman were bitten by a radioactive Man-Bat and then fought crime disguised as Man-Bat would he be Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Man or simply Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Batman?
34049,Sheldon,Yeah but us monkeys doesn’t pop. Oh oh oh oh wait we monkeys there you go. Hey when can we start running tests on it?
34050,Sheldon,Look. A new topical antihistamine with lidocaine. Wow. I can’t wait until I get a rash.
34051,Sheldon,Okay look it’s not really about Ricardo and Tondelaya. It is really about her boss who doesn’t quite know how to handle this situation and could use your advice which is surprising because Dr. Einstein Von Brainstorm he’s usually pretty smart about these things.
34052,Sheldon,Oh we’re not exchanging gifts.
34053,Sheldon,You’re here a lot now.
34054,Sheldon,Very well. Shall we switch topics to Isaac Newton v. Gottfried Leibniz?
34055,Sheldon,Hmm let me think. Nothing. I’m a delight.
34056,Raj,Don’t blow too hard. If you pop him I will vomit.
34057,Sheldon,Why can’t Leonard teach you?
34059,Sheldon,No I can do this. I just I just need another energy drink. Oh no.
34060,Penny,Oh so follow him.
34061,Raj,Interesting. Penny’s current suitor asking advice from her former suitor.
34062,Penny,You know this is my day off Sheldon.
34063,Raj,True but thanks to meditation I am able to stay in the same room with them without urinating. Now close your eyes.
34064,Leonard,Excuse me.  A couple of circulars nothing important.
34065,Penny,It’s a chocolate chip cookie.
34066,Penny,Please yes.
34067,Sheldon,When it’s done charging. Or you land on the time machine. Obviously.
34068,Sheldon,But you don’t have a life-threatening condition. Why would you take the risk of surgery?
34069,Sheldon,According to a classic psychological experiment by Yerkes and Dodson in order to maximize performance one must create a state of productive anxiety. So I’d like to ask you all to do something for me. Keep me on my toes. Just throw me off my game. Essentially go out of your way to make my life miserable.
34070,Sheldon,Oh here’s another one. I wish that the apple pancake mix was on the top shelf because it starts with an A but I don’t put it there because I don’t want you breaking one of your little legs when you’re supposed to be making my breakfast.
34071,Howard,And when you go to a Chinese restaurant he always gets the same fortune in his fortune cookie.
34072,Sheldon,Alright let me put it this way. Your gross receipts on this one order will be over $3000 for one night’s work.
34073,Leonard,All right I’ll get rid of him. But you owe me one.
34074,Howard,Oh yeah right. Sorry. My name is Puss in Boots. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
34075,Sheldon,Be more specific.
34076,Howard,Cool. Did she discover a cure for something?
34077,Sheldon,Okay maybe this will help. Imagine you’re holding a pen. Before you go too far not a special pen with your initials engraved on it that’ll make the next part really hard.
34078,Sheldon,Well I’ve been crunching the numbers and so far I’ve gotten your probability of death all the way to a sphincter-tightening one in 300.
34079,Sheldon,Not if you’re a rugby team.
34080,Sheldon,Wow. Didn’t see that coming.
34081,Sheldon,I don’t understand. If you were in a non-emotional relationship then why are you having  what appears be an emotional response?
34082,Sheldon,Oh not just date night our fifth anniversary.
34083,Sheldon,So was my dad. And then he did.
34084,Howard,Why don’t you put your mother in a home?
34085,Penny,You have a Bat Signal?
34086,Penny,You’re right. You’re absolutely right. I should have been honest with you and told you the gift was too much.
34087,Leonard,Uh it’s what controls the arm.
34088,Sheldon,Or worse up.
34089,Leonard,Well there’s nothing you can do about it so relax sit back enjoy the clickety-clack of the steel wheels on the polished rails.
34090,Sheldon,Before you leave could you test these noise-cancelling headphones?
34091,Sheldon,Penny while I subscribe to the many worlds theory which posits the existence of an infinite number of Sheldons in an infinite number of universes I assure you that in none of them am I dancing.
34092,Penny,Howard has a hairy chest?
34093,Leonard,Snipe!
34094,Penny,Do you know what he’s doing?
34095,Sheldon,I… I… I don’t understand. Your grandmother’s alive?
34096,Howard,You know who’s apparently very smart is the girl who played TV’s Blossom. She got a PhD in neuroscience or something.
34097,Sheldon,Fine.
34098,Howard,Don’t worry I can take a hint. No more murder mystery parties.
34099,Raj,You know what I’m thinking? I’m thinking Howard wasn’t making a back-scratching metaphor. I’m thinking there was some actual scratching involved.
34100,Howard,I don’t want to hug you either. I was just feeling blue.
34101,Sheldon,I’ll do it.
34102,Leonard,A little bit.
34103,Howard,Yeah whatever. Just go buy a sweater.
34104,Sheldon,When I lost my own father I didn’t have any friends to help me through it. You do.
34105,Leonard,Just grab the door.
34106,Raj,Or maybe he heard it’s Tator Tot Tuesday. That’s why I’m here.
34107,Leonard,Oh I hope they let us in soon. I’m tired of running to the gas station to use the bathroom. The guy makes me buy a Gatorade every time. It’s a vicious circle.
34108,Penny,Sheldon have you ever kissed a girl?
34109,Sheldon,You know what you are? Well you’re a green blooded buzzkill. Perhaps it’s time you beam on out of here.
34110,Raj,And this is Leonard and Sheldon’s apartment.
34111,Howard,It’s okay. It’s by choice. Well their choice and it’s not okay.
34112,Raj,Whoa whoa. Walking up to a strange woman in a bar usually doesn’t work.
34113,Raj,You guys suck.
34114,Penny,Have you been running?
34115,Penny,Do you really want to get into this right now?
34116,Leonard,Okay well there there was a lot of drinking and craziness going on.
34117,Raj,You know on Game of Thrones Balon Greyjoy received his son’s genitals in a box.
34118,Howard,Sheldon I’ve hidden the dirty sock from the roof somewhere in your apartment. Unless you are willing to come with us to meet this girl it will remain there forever.
34119,Penny,Come on in. Wait wait she’s not gonna come here looking for you is she?
34121,Sheldon,I’m not going to say another word until you people settle down. I’m waiting.
34122,Penny,Okay the reason he deceived you is you were being a pain in the ass.
34123,Howard,Yeah I’m right here buddy. How are you?
34124,Sheldon,Hey we’re both great at this.
34125,Leonard,Wait you went to a chapel?
34126,Leonard,I don’t really feel I deserve it.
34127,Leonard,Hello Penny.
34128,Sheldon,But if I don’t come into work what am I supposed to do with myself?
34129,Howard,Come on dude we’ve been friends for years.
34130,Raj,You know me. I’m from India. I can’t resist children begging. So how’s it going with the title to the house?
34131,Sheldon,And a pointy hat sticking out of your eyeball.
34132,Penny,Almost 1am.
34133,Sheldon,Well other than when they’re chugging through your bowels these things are magic.
34134,Raj,Enough chitchat. How do we know you are who you say you are?
34136,Leonard,Or you’re just a tall annoying frog.
34137,Sheldon,Our collaboration is a work of the mind. We don’t need desks.
34138,Sheldon,See? She’s not offended. And now you finally have an answer.
34139,Penny,Are you kidding? You brought fancy wine and made fondue. I’ve slept with guys for less. It’s a joke. Based on real events.
34140,Sheldon,Perhaps I will. This rock encapsulates all my negative emotions. I will cast you far away. Feel free to take out a pigeon while you’re at it.
34141,Sheldon,All right. But this better not be some elaborate scheme to get me out of my shirt.
34142,Sheldon,You don’t shove them. They come with an easy-glide applicator.
34143,Penny,I already quit.
34144,Howard,Oh true. They’re practically giving them away. You know in exchange for money.
34145,Leonard,We did them at Princeton too.
34146,Sheldon,Oh I’m ready. I don’t know if Stuart told you what you’re up against tonight but before you stands the co-captain of the East Texas Christian Youth Holy Roller Bowling League championship team. Seven to twelve year-old division. Also Penny’s pretty good.
34147,Leonard,I’m telling you the Lenwoloppali Differential Equation Scanner meets a real need. We’ve got a hit.
34148,Raj,Hang on a sec. Why do you get first crack at her?
34149,Penny,Yes. That is a real thing. And it doesn’t mean you don’t care about each other it just means things are moving at a pace you’re not comfortable with and that’s fine.
34150,Sheldon,You continue to underestimate me my good man.
34151,Leonard,Goodnight. 
34152,Sheldon,Although now that I think about it Leonard would never go swimming in public without his swim shirt.
34154,Sheldon,But they’ll know I’m not you. Should I call myself Professor Proton Jr.?
34155,Penny,When I go I usually just get hammered and ride the cable cars.
34156,Leonard,Hey we’re all going over to the Apple store to make fun of the guys at the Genius Bar. You want to come?
34157,Sheldon,Well it’s been a rough day. I usually go chamomile tea but I don’t think that’s going to cut it.
34158,Leonard,Oh I knew it Sheldon changed the password.
34159,Sheldon,Thank you. No bendy straw some party.
34160,Leonard,Interesting.
34161,Leonard,Sorry.
34162,Sheldon,What a surprise. Did you invite me back just so you could ignore me?
34163,Penny,Okay you don’t know what’s gonna happen.
34164,Raj,This is not how I imagined this day going I should be with them right now.
34165,Penny,Bernadette or the troll?
34166,Raj,Answer it.
34167,Howard,Well then double it because my building’s a lot nicer than this dump.
34168,Leonard,Should we talk to some of these women?
34169,Sheldon,He lied and I’m feeling very uncomfortable about it.
34170,Sheldon,You can catch even more flies with manure. What’s your point?
34171,Howard,Of course it does. Didn’t your baby room have a theme?
34172,Leonard,From her micro-husband. That is amazing. How long did this take you?
34173,Sheldon,Well I’ve just never played Dungeons & Dragons with girls before.
34174,Leonard,I bet the key’s behind it.
34175,Sheldon,Excuse me. I object. You propose a guessing game yet you don’t give me enough time to guess. For the record I was going to say your sister Priya.
34176,Penny,Really?
34177,Sheldon,Like has Leonard betrayed any of his friends recently?
34178,Sheldon,I wasn’t making a joke I was merely stating fact. Amy and I have a superior relationship to yours.
34179,Sheldon,Creepy old dude from Dancing with the Stars.
34180,Leonard,Yeah.
34181,Leonard,Oh relax she’s in her crate. She can’t get out.
34182,Raj,But this is other money.
34183,Raj,Address?
34184,Leonard,Oh that is so nice.
34185,Leonard,Oh I do. The the field of blue represents you being miserable and the lion sticking its tongue out means I’m happy about it.
34186,Sheldon,Yes. If Penny’s going to be spending nights here again you’ll need to set up an escrow account. Sign here.
34187,Leonard,Hi we’re here to pick up an order for Comic Center.
34188,Howard,Although I knew the line doesn’t make me Nathan Fillion.
34189,Leonard,Coming right up.
34191,Penny,Well when you realized what it was why didn’t you stop?
34192,Penny,Oh you always know what not to say. I just i can’t believe you did all this.
34193,Leonard,Exactly. Right after they said yeah.
34194,Raj,Fine. Tell her I have a deep sexy voice like James Earl Jones.
34195,Penny,Yeah sure sure. Vegas is fun too.
34196,Raj,Mm Disneyland? I don’t know. With all the crowds and the weird characters walking around just reminds me too much of India.
34197,Penny,It means he is special and smart and nice and…
34198,Sheldon,Are you in danger?
34200,Leonard,It is?
34201,Leonard,Yes I am. You want to see a simulation on my laptop?
34202,Howard,Oh my God you’re back. Oh look at you. You you look like you grew.
34203,Howard,That is a great idea.
34204,Sheldon,That would maximize oxygen for optimal combustion.
34205,Sheldon,I know that but with skin as fair as mine moon burn is a real possibility.
34206,Leonard,That’s where Sheldon sits.
34207,Leonard,Go ahead.
34208,Penny,Yes!
34209,Sheldon,Great now I have to start all over.
34210,Leonard,Oh. Huh um maybe if you like women who are tall… and perfect.
34211,Leonard,Leonard.
34212,Sheldon,I don’t drink coffee.
34213,Leonard,What about your old look well-groomed ventriloquist doll?
34214,Leonard,Hello Mrs. Latham. Yes I live with him. I don’t I I really don’t know why. Tonight? Sure that’d be great. Okay I’ll I’ll see you then. Bye. She wants to have dinner and talk about my research.
34215,Raj,You know who I blame for my loneliness? The United States of America. Your movies and your TV shows promised streets paved with beautiful blonde women with big bazongas.
34216,Sheldon,Hello. So I guess you’re really holding up the other four fingers?
34217,Raj,Yeah sure. I understand. Yeah I’m very busy too.
34218,Penny,No no I meant…
34219,Raj,Uh next?
34220,Sheldon,No.
34221,Sheldon,Priya has moved back to India to pursue her law career. Instead of desperately trying to keep this intercontinental relationship alive you could use that time to take up a hobby.
34222,Sheldon,If it makes you feel any better Thursday is no longer Cruciferous Vegetable Night.
34223,Sheldon,Not true. No look at me. I had an engagement ring to give a girl and instead she rejected me. And am I emotional about that? No. No I am sitting here on a couch talking about my favourite TV character like nothing happened. ‘Cause I am just like him all logical all the time.
34224,Sheldon,Exactly half.
34225,Penny,Uh not yet but I will.
34226,Penny,Oh I’m ready.
34227,Leonard,Right. Because girls are always like ooh that guy owns two Star Trek uniforms and gets a lot of ear infections. I got to get me some of that.
34228,Leonard,Hey who’s ready for Halo?
34229,Sheldon,I was wrong. Penny can do better.
34230,Penny,Fine. What would you rather do as a scene study?
34231,Penny,What? No I really want to know what happens and Bernadette really really really wants to know what happens.
34232,Leonard,Why didn’t you say so?
34233,Sheldon,Well whatever we want. Hang out do experiments make him take 12 pictures with us so we can make a calendar.
34234,Raj,Ten nine eight…
34235,Leonard,Well I was gonna but there were too many tongues in my mouth.
34236,Raj,Oh I take it back don’t mention me.
34237,Penny,Okay what’s the big deal? Look if it helps me make a sale with a physician I don’t think it hurts to flirt a little. I mean laugh at their joke touch their arm maybe crank up the AC in the car beforehand you know to wake up the girls.
34238,Leonard,I never stopped hanging out with you.
34239,Sheldon,I am not a loser. Pictionary is not a true test of any real intelligence or skill.
34240,Leonard,Seriously please find another book.
34242,Penny,Well good for you.
34243,Howard,Oh Howard stop.
34244,Leonard,Good it’s not just me.
34245,Howard,That would be amazing. I was literally just looking at my moving boxes trying to pick one to live in.
34246,Sheldon,I’m not surprised considering the way you talk about them behind their backs.
34247,Raj,You’re being silly. I can leave whenever I want.
34248,Leonard,I’d like to propose a toast. The dream to go up into space is one we all share and Howard’s making that a reality. We’re all very proud of you.
34250,Penny,All right so we’ll ask him to come back.
34251,Sheldon,All right how’s this for revenge? A solution of hydrogen peroxide and one of saturated potassium iodide.
34252,Raj,Miss Congeniality 2 Armed and Fabulous. I mean you know a movie’s bad when my homegirl Sandy B can’t save it.
34253,Sheldon,No. If I got on the bridge of the Enterprise I would never ever leave.
34254,Leonard,Yeah I just stopped by to say…  Yeah so hi!
34255,Sheldon,Of course. You know why couldn’t she just like Ziggy? Yeah? That thing’s riddled with plot holes.
34256,Leonard,Okay I I I think it’s safe to say that we’ve all done some things we’re not particularly proud of. But come on we’re friends. Friends overlook each other’s minor lapses. For the record Howard I’m sorry that I broke our pact.
34257,Sheldon,No idea. All I know is I’m gonna be working on the railroad all the livelong day.
34258,Leonard,All right we’re down the rabbit hole. What are you doing?
34259,Penny,Like you could get a brown bear.
34260,Raj,This has nothing to do with my sperm count.
34261,Penny,Really they have your little name label in them.
34262,Sheldon,Can you believe this guy?
34263,Sheldon,And me.
34264,Leonard,No I mean just you and me.
34265,Howard,Before Emily I was alone for so long. I just I don’t know if I can do that again.
34266,Leonard,Article 10 subsection C if questioned Penny may not say that everything is fine if it isn’t. Other unacceptable responses include it’s nothing don’t worry about it and I said it’s nothing don’t worry about it.
34267,Leonard,Okay I think I understand.
34268,Raj,So I have an idea for a filk song. It’s kind of a a power ballad superhero crossover tale of epic proportions.
34269,Sheldon,Empedocles thought he was a god and jumped into a volcano. And Pythagoras had an irrational fear of beans. Tesla fell madly in love with a pigeon who he claimed loved him back.
34270,Leonard,Oh hey guys.
34271,Howard,Like this?
34272,Raj,Oh yes. In my culture it’s expected to have a chaparone to oversee a first date. Plus I want to make a good impression and no offence but with you guys here I look like six two.
34273,Leonard,Okay uh here it is. I met this girl and I kissed her and I feel terrible about it. But it’s done it’s never gonna happen again. And I am so so sorry.
34274,Raj,Very well thank you.
34275,Sheldon,Hmm? Well it sounds like the kind of thing one would bring up at a quarterly roommate agreement meeting. Lucky for you it’s tomorrow.
34277,Penny,Oh come on. I just told you I had a hard day.
34278,Penny,Honey neither of us comes off good in that story.
34279,Leonard,You heard that huh?
34280,Leonard,You know maybe you and I wouldn’t be together but you wouldn’t have done so great yourself.
34281,Sheldon,I have an old teddy bear I secretly wiped my nose on for years.
34282,Sheldon,You make that joke every three months. I still don’t get it. Leonard wait. What are you doing?
34283,Penny,Wh… What the hell did she say?
34285,Leonard,Okay that’s enough.
34286,Penny,Great so you want me to stay at a job I’m not happy at?
34287,Penny,No.
34289,Howard,What happened?
34290,Raj,I guess uh I’d like her to sit me down look me in the eye and say I was wrong. I love you. And then maybe she could touch me in a special way.
34292,Penny,Oh hey. What’s up?
34293,Penny,You’ve been doing it all day. Do you even know what an insult is?
34294,Howard,And that’s how Mommy and Daddy met.
34295,Leonard,So?
34296,Raj,Junior Mints are pretty apologetic.
34297,Sheldon,Oh brilliant. I’ve been itching to pull that trigger.
34298,Leonard,I can go so slow it’ll be like there’s a snail in your mouth.
34300,Leonard,So they steamed your dumplings get over it. New topic please.
34301,Leonard,I guess not.
34302,Leonard,We both have people in our lives who… want to nip intestinal polyps in the bud.
34303,Leonard,Oh everything we need for your autograph session head shots markers.
34304,Penny,Oh maybe. Get closer.
34305,Leonard,Oh I’m just trying to find the stupid next of kin to this stupid video store owner so I can return the DVD and see the look on Sheldon’s stupid face when he sees that I didn’t let this get to me.
34306,Leonard,Oh right no I’m lactose intolerant.
34308,Sheldon,It is kind of cute.
34309,Sheldon,Oh good that was an unusual interaction. I wasn’t sure.
34310,Sheldon,You know what’s interesting about caves Leonard?
34311,Howard,Let’s go home. You want to get something to eat?
34312,Penny,Come on I mean you’re not upset that your marriage is over?
34313,Raj,Yeah Penny packed you a bag.
34314,Sheldon,The computations required to overcome the deployability issues are more significant than we thought.
34315,Sheldon,Yes well I’m not a child I’m a grown man capable of living my life as I see fit. And I certainly don’t need someone telling on me to my mother.
34316,Raj,October sixth.
34317,Raj,Not yet this is fun. Ooh I know. I’d let her free my willy. Where you going?
34318,Sheldon,Come in. 
34319,Sheldon,Formal protest.
34320,Leonard,Well like I said we’re about to get married and I I want a clean slate. No secrets.
34321,Howard,Thank you.
34322,Sheldon,My pleasure. For a non-physicist you have a remarkable grasp of how electric dipoles in the brain’s water molecules could not possibly form a Bose condensate.
34323,Raj,Judge’s ruling?
34324,Penny,Great here’s my spare key. Thank you.
34325,Leonard,Okay I’m leaving before the black helicopters get here.
34326,Penny,Leonard.
34327,Penny,Arthur are you okay?
34328,Leonard,Aw see yeah you probably shouldn’t have done that. So write another e-mail set the record straight it’s no big deal.
34329,Leonard,Sheldon knight takes bishop. You all right?
34330,Howard,Did he help you make a decision about the movie?
34331,Leonard,If you could run out and get a PhD that might make her like you.
34332,Penny,Oh good you heard me.
34333,Leonard,No. Although Howard was making some real strides in that area until he met Bernadette.
34334,Leonard,Oh kids buy comic books. It would be great to figure out a way to get more kids in the store.
34335,Penny,I’m with Leonard.
34336,Raj,Come on Howard fire it in.
34337,Raj,No. 
34338,Penny,Yeah it’s yours.
34339,Howard,That was all a lie? This year’s gifts are already wrapped!
34340,Penny,Okay you can take him for shoes.
34341,Sheldon,Leonard told me to stay.
34342,Leonard,Yeah. How did you know?
34343,Penny,Oh great selection great prices.
34344,Sheldon,I know.
34345,Sheldon,All right geez. What a grouch.
34346,Penny,Ugh. Amy why did you tell him that?
34347,Leonard,From a Kevin Smith movie?
34348,Sheldon,What happened to me? I used to excel at these things.
34349,Raj,No way. Not Bill Murray.
34350,Sheldon,Well then as my meemaw would say looks like we butchered a pig but nobody wanted bacon.
34351,Leonard,En el acelerador de particulares.
34352,Sheldon,Anyway thank you.
34353,Penny,Does NASA know you’re using that thing as a napkin holder?
34354,Raj,Why did you even go to dinner with the guy?
34355,Leonard,You’re right. I didn’t ask her out I should ask her out.
34356,Sheldon,But. Oh this changes everything.
34357,Sheldon,You ripped out your own fake blonde hair.
34358,Penny,Oh I’m scared.
34359,Leonard,No it was a valid hypothesis.
34360,Penny,I don’t know he’s 13. Just pick out anything.
34361,Sheldon,Boilerplate stuff. A modified roommate agreement for a temporary house guest. And a living will and durable power of attorney.
34362,Leonard,Listen can I talk to you about your girlfriend?
34363,Sheldon,Thanks.
34364,Howard,The dating site matched a woman with Sheldon.
34365,Sheldon,Amy mourning the inevitable is a complete waste of time.
34366,Howard,What kind of idiot throws away a terrific chair like this?
34367,Leonard,Excuse me sorry excuse me.
34368,Howard,They are too.
34369,Penny,Oh and who’s that?
34370,Leonard,Not really. I googled how to do that. So listen have you ever made a pact with someone?
34371,Sheldon,No but it’s not just video games. I downloaded the new O.S. for my phone took me a week to stop accidentally texting kissy faces to everyone.
34372,Leonard,Oh!
34373,Raj,I’m sorry and how much money did your version of Frozen make?
34374,Howard,Oh. He’s here to support me so anything you have to say you can say in front of him.
34375,Sheldon,Who?
34376,Leonard,Okay Sheldon I understand that you’re going through a bit of a career crisis you’re searching for some other area where you can feel valuable and productive but I need to tell you something and I want you to listen carefully.
34377,Sheldon,So we’re just randomly choosing a restaurant without researching it online?
34378,Penny,I love scavenger hunts. My friends and I had them all the time.
34379,Penny,Understood.
34380,Howard,Clearly she was sending you a message to take a hike Mike.
34381,Howard,Oh no it’s okay. I just found a wobble.
34382,Leonard,Because Sheldon doesn’t have a drug addicted cousin Leopold.
34383,Penny,That is so sweet.
34384,Leonard,I sent them a bikini shot of you years ago. This is nice. I kind of wish no one else was coming.
34385,Howard,Maybe he’s having a lover’s spat with Penny.
34386,Sheldon,Yes. It should have a big picture of him and the words is this your bird? Not anymore. We’re going to have so much fun together. You can carry messages to all my enemies. I can tie a string to your leg and fly you like a kite.
34387,Raj,Well you should be ’cause she was looking good.
34388,Sheldon,He wrote back. Cooper and Hofstadter resorting to juvenile attempts at humour is proof they have nothing to back up their ridiculous paper. It should come as no surprise given they work at Cal Tech essentially a technical school where even the physicists are basically engineers. Engineers? Do you know how insulting that is?
34389,Sheldon,Perhaps you’re right. I’m sorry for my behaviour. I’ve had alcohol and it’s caused me to be inappropriate.
34390,Leonard,He made you his screensaver.
34391,Howard,But I can’t have one.
34392,Sheldon,Are you still mad about the sperm bank?
34393,Leonard,Right.
34394,Leonard,Oh damn it!
34395,Raj,The polite response is thank you for noticing.
34396,Raj,So when they ride horses and fly on the birds they also use their ponytails.
34397,Sheldon,You’re right. I should embrace the chaos.
34398,Penny,Maybe if we’re quiet he’ll go away.
34399,Leonard,Oh it’s all right. We ended up having a threesome with her friend humiliation so…
34400,Howard,I don’t understand.
34401,Penny,Really?
34402,Sheldon,Penny’s brain teaser this morning. She and Koothrappali emerge from your bedroom. She is dishevelled and Raj is dressed only in a sheet. The sole clue it’s not what it looks like.
34403,Leonard,How about that? I finally caught a break.
34404,Raj,No uh-uh you’re going down!
34405,Leonard,Oh come on that’s got to count. There was a really strong undertow we could have died.
34406,Leonard,Whatever you recommend.
34407,Penny,Um well I yeah you got me.
34408,Raj,I mean come on look at you. You’re classically handsome you’ve got a swimmer’s body. Next to you I look like me.
34409,Penny,No. Not at all.
34410,Howard,Like dude on dude but with women?
34411,Penny,Whoa. When would you leave?
34412,Sheldon,Yeah we’re going to have to stop by Pottery Barn on the way to work I bought these Star Wars sheets but they turned out to be much too stimulating to be compatible with a good night’s sleep. I don’t like the way Darth Vader stares at me.
34413,Sheldon,How could you not like getting attention for playing Wesley Crusher? You were wonderful. A know-it-all boy genius with an eidetic memory. Who couldn’t relate to that?
34414,Howard,Hey how’s the mommy-to-be?
34415,Leonard,Hey uh listen everybody. Before Howard gets here et’s all just agree to not bring up the letter from his father.
34416,Penny,Huh?
34417,Sheldon,Interesting. You’re afraid of insects and women. Ladybugs must render you catatonic. It was a joke. I made it to lessen your discomfort. You’re welcome
34418,Leonard,Okay?
34419,Sheldon,Oh no I should apologize. Uh I never realized to what extent our friendship was a burden to you.
34420,Leonard,That’s great.
34421,Leonard,Yes.
34422,Leonard,You’re too close to it but Amy has had a huge impact on you.
34423,Leonard,Well you know if you if if if you uh I don’t oh what’s the word I’m looking for?
34424,Sheldon,Raj did you get the job with Professor Laughlin?
34425,Leonard,Three.
34426,Sheldon,Informal protest.
34427,Sheldon,I’m sorry.
34428,Howard,Yeah.
34429,Leonard,Yeah Leonard Hofstadter. What happened?
34430,Leonard,What do you want Sheldon?
34431,Sheldon,Fine I’ll have the Barbecue Burger.
34432,Penny,And you if you are so okay with the way things are between us why are you so jealous?
34433,Leonard,Go ahead.
34434,Sheldon,Hello.
34435,Sheldon,If it’ll make you feel better we rarely listen.
34436,Penny,You know not a lot of people know this but the monoamine oxidase enzyme was discovered by a woman Mary Bernheim. That’s right my phone is just as smart as you guys.
34437,Sheldon,You’re very welcome.
34438,Raj,Well you were always so nice to me I thought maybe you liked me.
34439,Penny,Unless you’re sleeping with one of them seeing other people isn’t a big deal.
34440,Raj,Sometimes I put the TV on mute just to pretend she’s still with me. But I can’t watch the closed captioning without crying.
34441,Leonard,Can I get his contact info?
34443,Leonard,You’ve really got to get out more.
34444,Sheldon,Now where was I? Let’s see. Oh yes. Over here. You… What are you doing now?
34445,Penny,Okay listen there’s something I need to tell you. I’ve been thinking about going back to school for a while now. So a couple months ago I started taking a history class at the community college.
34446,Raj,We need a social catalyst.
34447,Raj,What’s going on?
34448,Penny,Yeah back off he’s all mine.
34449,Sheldon,Can’t talk. Spitball. Probably gonna die.
34450,Raj,Which part?
34451,Leonard,Hire him to do what?
34452,Sheldon,With or without a numbing agent?
34453,Howard,Come on Howard fire it in.
34454,Penny,You know I used to wear tank tops a lot. That was a big selling point.
34455,Raj,Hey.
34456,Leonard,One two three four five six seven eight nine ten. I meant golly Sheldon you’ve been gone a long time.
34457,Penny,Has Shelly ever freaked out like this before.
34458,Sheldon,Wait. Will you please rub this on my chest.
34459,Leonard,Okay well now you’ve had some time to think about it. So what do you want to say?
34460,Penny,Okay you know what? Let’s just try a different improv. Uh oh this time we will be two winos living under a freeway overpass.
34461,Howard,Zack this is my friend Claire.
34462,Raj,I was there. It was funny.
34463,Leonard,And their Sherpas.
34464,Leonard,That still leaves me here with him.
34465,Leonard,Okay like usual. Good.
34466,Raj,Hey what’s going on?
34467,Howard,So you were wrong.
34468,Leonard,No!
34469,Howard,I’m so not talking to you. I’m talking to him.
34470,Raj,Are you happy now?
34471,Leonard,Yeah me too.
34472,Howard,It was the only way to keep you from being such a huge Dickensian. You see that? I added the ensian.
34473,Howard,Wow that’s harsh.
34474,Leonard,I’m just gonna run to the store and get a few things. I’ll pick you up when you’re done.
34476,Sheldon,Morning.
34477,Leonard,Sheldon why don’t you just acknowledge that you have feelings for Amy and you don’t want her going out with other men?
34478,Sheldon,Correct. You’re not supposed to drink alcohol when operating heavy machinery.
34479,Penny,Yeah you’re really just making it worse.
34480,Leonard,I know. It’s still gonna be weird to see the movie without him.
34481,Howard,I know. It’ll be awful.
34482,Raj,You know if I made more money I could take time off from work and give pretty girls submarine rides.
34483,Sheldon,Well if we assume your looks are average yeah right off the bat fifty percent of men on Earth are more attractive than you. That’s one point five billion handsome lads standing by waiting to rain on your parade.
34484,Raj,I don’t know. How do you want to start?
34485,Leonard,Is it possible we’re having two different conversations?
34486,Howard,Are you not looking at me? I am Brown Dynamite. Why do you put six sugars in your coffee?
34487,Penny,I’ll hit you in the face with a pillow.
34488,Sheldon,Hmm. It’d have to be something heinous something that makes her as miserable as she’s making me. Oh I’ve got it. This is good.
34489,Howard,But Howard…
34490,Howard,Hey I got you a little gift.
34491,Leonard,Hey I’m trying to help you.
34492,Raj,Not if it has a hole in the middle.
34493,Howard,I agree. That is if you’ve never been to or heard of a party before.
34494,Penny,Fine if you really want me to I will pick your mom up.
34495,Raj,That’s Unbreakable by Khloe and Lamar. And for your information it’s unisex.
34496,Penny,So?
34497,Sheldon,It’s called scientific curiosity. Now go get butter.
34498,Leonard,No it doesn’t.
34499,Sheldon,Well I’m not. And if I could read people’s minds life would be so much simpler.
34500,Howard,No but when I was six years old I tried to start a boy band called Frankie Goes to Bollywood. But I couldn’t get any other boys to join so my parents asked the servants to be my backup dancers. Wait when you sign servants don’t sign it like I’m bragging. Sign it in a way that I sound humble with just a hint of that’s right I had servants.
34501,Penny,No he’d just take it the wrong way.
34502,Penny,Great. Here you go. What you’re going to do is you’re going to stick your thumb down its throat grab the guts and pull.
34503,Sheldon,Your failed attempt to go back to college?
34504,Howard,You know Sheldon if we apply to be one of those teams we could be on the ground floor of something big not just for theoretical physics but for astrophysics as well.
34505,Leonard,Easy peasy I’m doing it right now.
34506,Leonard,Actually Penny he’s Rob…
34507,Penny,No the plan was to tell people we decided to stay friends. That’s a little hard to do when you’re always being such a tool bag.
34508,Leonard,Why not?
34509,Leonard,I’m not that white. My great-great grandmother was half Cherokee. I know that’s not the right kind of Indian but it is something.
34510,Sheldon,We never invited Louis-slash-Louise over.
34511,Sheldon,Well did you see this sticker?
34512,Howard,If you weren’t screwing around with Sheldon’s assistant none of this would be happening.
34513,Raj,Ooh. Ooh ooh. We could make a video-playing device that simultaneously translates the information into a tactile medium.
34514,Howard,Fine I don’t want to watch with you either. I’ll go over here.
34515,Penny,No. Why?
34516,Raj,Mmm and you know what that means. Someone’s skin’s about to be softer than ever.
34517,Sheldon,Yes Penny.
34519,Leonard,And then I say one little thing and I end up being the bad guy!
34520,Penny,I don’t work on Mondays.
34521,Leonard,Have you met Bernadette’s parents?
34522,Howard,I buried it there so we could go home.
34523,Raj,And play.
34524,Leonard,Apparently so.
34525,Leonard,NEVER!
34526,Leonard,I am not washed-up.
34527,Leonard,Oh right right right right right.
34528,Sheldon,No.
34529,Penny,I’ll I’ll tell you later.
34530,Leonard,If you’re that upset go get her back.
34531,Sheldon,Thank you. This is all so thoughtful. Excuse me.
34533,Penny,She would find it perfectly acceptable. You guys saw it. We bonded.
34534,Penny,It was a letter explaining that your dad wasn’t who he said he was. Eventually his other life caught up to him and the only way to keep you and your mom safe was to leave.
34535,Sheldon,You can do this.
34536,Raj,Wait your your mother is sleeping with your dentist?
34537,Sheldon,There it is. It’s just a gate. On a road.
34539,Leonard,Yeah Raj why?
34540,Penny,Yeah he’s a gift all right.
34541,Leonard,Really?
34542,Penny,Ah yeah now that’s what I’m talking about.
34543,Penny,That’s so sweet but what if I didn’t like it?
34544,Leonard,Why should I let it go? Why don’t you just tell the guy to find another place to sleep? 
34545,Howard,I thought he might be a little more excited.
34546,Raj,I really appreciate it. Uh can you hold on one second? Hey so Howard what’s the bathroom situation gonna be?
34547,Howard,No need. I’ve already done that. Siri do you have a last name?
34548,Leonard,Thanks a lot Howard.
34549,Howard,Okay. I have a request to make.
34550,Penny,Yeah see that’s what kids should have.
34551,Leonard,Come on. We said we were sorry.
34552,Penny,Tur-briska-fil?
34554,Sheldon,So you’re saying this is a regulation deck?
34555,Howard,Okay um okay what if you rig up a pulley system and move yourself across the room in a harness?
34556,Howard,Yeah she and my dad are going through a bit of a rough patch so I wanted to do something to let her know I was thinking about her.
34557,Penny,What no why?
34558,Sheldon,Greetings. You all remember Amy Farrah Fowler.
34559,Sheldon,Flaming Spittoon. And for the record I’m very disappointed in you cowpokes. We’re playing our inaugural round of Wild West and Witches and I’m the only one who bothered to dress for the occasion.  Patooie.
34560,Penny,So the point is I may have saved her life.
34561,Leonard,You know what why don’t you just do it? You’ll go have fun for a few weeks make some money and who knows what it might lead to?
34562,Sheldon,Yeah. Here. I’ll catch you up.
34563,Leonard,I got to tell you the more I read about the primordial gravity wave discovery the more excited I get.
34564,Penny,Is he quitting his job at the university?
34565,Raj,If you were having Sheldon’s baby would you really want him in the room?
34566,Howard,Thanks.
34567,Penny,Sure.
34568,Leonard,Look I get it and I want you to know that I support whatever you want to do.
34569,Raj,There you go. All cozy wozy. Here let’s see what the doctor says to keep an eye out for. Hmm. Rajesh I was dreading Valentine’s Day. Thank you for spending it with me. Yvette. Cinnamon she-she gave me her phone number. If I’d known it was that easy I would have considered poisoning you months ago. Oh what should I say? Oh I know. I’ll point out her name’s Yvette and that she’s a vet. That’s hysterical. She’ll love it.
34570,Leonard,So hang out with me and we’ll have boys’ night.
34571,Leonard,Me too. So you ever think about it?
34572,Leonard,Guys we’re not gonna get anything done if we start fighting. Now can you please try
34573,Sheldon,I’m not crazy. My mother had me tested.
34574,Raj,What happened with Leslie why did she dump you?
34575,Leonard,We can’t order Chinese food without Wolowitz?
34577,Leonard,Hey.
34578,Leonard,Yeah. Oh uh you don’t have on any jewellery do you?
34579,Sheldon,I was hoping by admitting my weakness to you I’d somehow be unburdened.
34580,Leonard,Yeah no sure.
34581,Penny,Oh God. Did you pull some weird Indian crap on me?
34582,Raj,I still wear mine when there’s a nip in the air.
34583,Raj,During which she defected to North Korea.
34584,Penny,Thank you.
34585,Penny,Sure.
34586,Sheldon,It’s the Chinese restaurant all over again. I assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is child’s play compared with three men each attempting to dance with 67% of a woman.
34587,Penny,You’re overthinking this.
34588,Sheldon,You know what would be nice?
34589,Leonard,Huh. I guess I owe the Betty Crocker company a letter of apology.
34591,Leonard,Wackadoodle.
34592,Leonard,Oh well it all happened kind of fast and we had to get physicals and buy thermal underwear and study up on you know snow and stuff. Sorry I was gonna tell you.
34593,Sheldon,Hurry up find him find him.
34594,Raj,I can’t believe they’re still married. Oh no I forgot Cinnamon’s toothbrush at Howard’s. I guess you’re sharing with Daddy again.
34595,Penny,It’s not.
34596,Sheldon,Really? I have never once been invited to have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.
34597,Sheldon,But you don’t even understand its symbolism.
34599,Sheldon,I mean it’s unfair; people just assume I’m going to be upset by Raj moving into my old room.
34600,Leonard,I’ll get you a blanket and a pillow.
34601,Leonard,Uh hang on. Empty your pockets.
34602,Sheldon,This is it. You are the practice round.
34603,Penny,Okay.
34605,Leonard,Okay uh here it is. Is it cheating if a guy has a girlfriend…
34606,Sheldon,I’m not sure how to respond Leonard. I don’t own Amy. Can’t own a person. At least not since? 1863. President Lincoln freed the? Slaves! Come on Leonard if you’re going to teach history these are the kind of facts you’ll have to know.
34607,Sheldon,Yeah excuse me Penny but in this room you’re the one who’s peculiar.
34608,Penny,I know I know. Zzzzzzzz.
34609,Sheldon,I’m not sorry. That’s true.
34610,Leonard,You didn’t?
34611,Howard,This is a treat what brings you guys by?
34612,Sheldon,So until Amy’s apartment is fixed she and I are living here together.
34613,Leonard,You know what? This bottle was meant to celebrate an achievement. Let’s make a pact. When one of us gets their first big breakthrough we’ll celebrate by opening this bottle of champagne and toasting Professor Abbott.
34614,Penny,Anyway I was talking to Leonard this morning and I think he feels really bad about it.
34615,Sheldon,Fine. I’ll just give them the finger.
34616,Raj,Well it’s too late.
34618,Penny,Uh for starters maybe you can not psychoanalyze everything I say?
34619,Sheldon,I guess we’ll call this a draw.
34620,Sheldon,I see what you’re doing. You accept an invitation to a party at the home of my sworn enemy he tells everyone we’re going to be there and when we don’t show he looks the fool. Fiendishly clever.
34621,Sheldon,Superman doesn’t sweat on Earth.
34622,Penny,Okay just tell me is it too soon to join a quest to the Black Castle?
34623,Sheldon,And I have nothing to contribute to this conversation. Because I too know absolutely nothing about Priya’s preferences in male companionship. And with that I will re-zip my lip.
34624,Sheldon,I’m sorry but could you be more specific?
34625,Howard,So how did you two meet?
34626,Howard,Yeah well I love her.
34627,Sheldon,Really?
34628,Leonard,Thank you.
34629,Leonard,Penny you know those are real right?
34630,Leonard,We were in here first you can’t be in here.
34631,Penny,Uh-huh yeah do I stay in the jungle or go towards the beach?
34632,Sheldon,Excellent choice.
34633,Sheldon, LeVar Burton?
34634,Sheldon,No thank you. I’m not eating pizza tonight.
34635,Penny,How about this?
34636,Penny,Girls.
34637,Leonard,You are it’s just…
34638,Raj,Exactly what I expected. Two people forcing their ideas on me and only one gentleman who could be bothered to ask me what my thoughts were. You two are out. Congratulations Leonard you’re on the team.
34639,Raj,Dude! Everybody left an hour ago! Surprise!
34640,Sheldon,I’m looking at the math and I think we can make the device between eight and ten percent smaller.
34641,Sheldon,Well by that logic I should be with someone short dull and needy eh? Not to cast aspersions but I can’t shake a stick around here without hitting that.
34642,Sheldon,Is that true?
34643,Penny,Soft kitty warm kitty little ball of fur.
34644,Sheldon,Professor Proton it’s an honour to meet you.
34645,Sheldon,What exactly is it you do? I know you chatter on about it all the time but I’ve never really paid attention.
34646,Raj,What does hit a reef mean?
34647,Leonard,You got it you girls are in charge.
34648,Penny,I know. Then you’ll finally stop talking about it.
34649,Leonard,I’m not going out tonight Raj.
34650,Raj,You know I recently read a fascinating article on infidelity among penguins.
34651,Leonard,Yeah maybe. Open it first.
34652,Sheldon,Gotcha.
34653,Penny,Oh no no no a bunch of us from work are going to Disneyland next Saturday and Sheldon wants to come.
34654,Sheldon,I’ve never slept on an air mattress before. No lumbar support whatsoever.
34655,Penny,Look Sheldon sweetie I know you’re feeling insecure but we’ve really got to go to sleep.
34656,Sheldon,Your turn Leonard.
34657,Leonard,Oh come on.
34658,Sheldon,There are more things in heaven and earth Horatio than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
34659,Penny,‘Course I heard about it. How did you hear about it?
34660,Leonard,Howard can’t you see she’s using you?
34661,Leonard,Yeah okay. No.
34662,Leonard,Can you please live with us forever?
34663,Raj,Uh okay that’s a separate issue. Let’s put a pin in that and just focus on the passive thing.
34664,Howard,You didn’t ask her out but that was a lot of sounds.
34665,Penny,Both.
34666,Leonard,Penny is an amazing shot. I think we have a real chance to win this week.
34667,Howard,Blowing the gates. Control shift B! Oh my God so many goblins!
34668,Sheldon,All right.
34669,Raj,Wha… You’re kidding!
34670,Sheldon,Amy I must say I was sceptical at first but this has truly been a transformative evening.
34671,Sheldon,Curses.
34672,Penny,You know I have always wanted to see a big science lab.
34673,Leonard,That’s just Sheldon backwards.
34674,Sheldon,Yeah I don’t think I can.
34675,Sheldon,Stuart please. You’re being rude.
34676,Leonard,Thanks Penny.
34677,Sheldon,Is my hamburger medium well?
34678,Raj,Be careful.
34679,Sheldon,I’m sensing awkwardness am I right?
34680,Sheldon,Droll.
34681,Sheldon,But you got it right?
34682,Sheldon,Oh very well. I can’t keep up this clever charade any longer. She told me that you were thinking of ending it with Leonard.
34683,Raj,Although it was already under control.
34684,Penny,Okay. Um let’s try this. Think of yourself as one of those limited edition toys people like to collect.
34685,Penny,No don’t.
34686,Leonard,You need to let it go Sheldon.
34687,Sheldon,This is not a sarape. This is a poncho. A sarape is open at the sides a poncho is closed this is a poncho and neither is a reason to call someone’s mother.
34688,Leonard,I was actually thinking about going.
34689,Penny,Okay hmm scented candles fuzzy slippers ooh floral bed sheets?
34690,Penny,Yeah sure come on in.
34691,Leonard,And there goes our hike.
34692,Penny,I’m not scared. I would’ve gone all Nebraska on their asses.
34693,Leonard,Hello.
34694,Sheldon,Because it’s a story of a pretty blonde girl tirelessly pursued by a small oddly-shaped man?
34695,Sheldon,Ooh we already have our first call.
34696,Leonard,Well I do know that it won’t be from an asteroid strike.
34697,Sheldon,Surprisingly yes.
34698,Leonard,All I’m saying is give me a heads-up.
34699,Sheldon,No once again I’m throwing you a bone. And once again you are welcome.
34700,Leonard,No.
34701,Leonard,You’re kidding. You have your own book?
34702,Howard,I don’t think we’re going to do that.
34703,Sheldon,I can’t sleep.
34704,Leonard,What?
34705,Raj,I am a man who can’t talk to women trying to figure out how to go on a romantic date with a girl who suffers from such crippling social anxiety she can’t be around other people.
34706,Penny,It’s nine o’clock.
34707,Sheldon,It’s not the same thing. I don’t think you know how I feel at all.
34708,Leonard,We’re not getting caught.
34709,Sheldon,Yes. I’m filling in for her husband who’s recovering from a horrible motorcycle accident. Lucky duck.
34710,Sheldon,Yeah. Shoulda woulda coulda Raj.
34711,Raj,Wait hold on. This is weird.
34712,Howard,In more ways than one. He’s a very handsome man.
34713,Raj,Oh we could play filk music.
34714,Raj,Come on. Don’t make me beg. And I’m from India so I know how to do it.
34715,Penny,Mm.
34716,Sheldon,I have many. My most treasured is an autographed napkin given to me by my very thoughtful friend Penny. That’s her over there.
34717,Penny,S’up?
34718,Sheldon,Here.
34719,Penny,Hey.
34720,Sheldon,You take that back.
34721,Sheldon,You too. Oh don’t forget. Tuesday the air filters need to be changed.
34722,Sheldon,Gentlemen I know we said we’d take turns but I think you’d agree that practicality dictates it remain here.
34723,Penny,Go Sports?
34724,Sheldon,Okay. I think we’ve found the problem here. It’s not the table at all. It’s you.
34725,Sheldon,It’s partially torn off but the segment that remains reads property of and the letter U.
34726,Sheldon,No I’ll be okay. But I think that I’d like to send the ring back to you.
34727,Leonard,Not only did Sheldon save my life he didn’t rat me out to the landlord. Or the police. Or Homeland Security.
34728,Penny,No music it is.
34729,Penny,Yeah I know right?
34730,Sheldon,Did you protest?
34731,Sheldon,Welcome aboard old chum.
34732,Sheldon,He is Mr. Earl Jones he is.
34733,Sheldon,Oh really? Well how about now?  And you got me nothing. Christmas is ruined. Let’s never speak of it again. Well this was fun.
34734,Sheldon,He’s right Leonard. The paradigm is to the death.
34735,Leonard,Oh my god you’re breaking up with me! Why would you take me out shopping and then break up with me? That is so cruel.
34736,Sheldon,So they’re requesting that the white boy play the funky music yes?
34737,Penny,Oh yeah no I I’m I’m glad.
34738,Sheldon,You know deep-sea divers holding their breath for several minutes have shown elevated markers of a protein that can signal brain damage.
34739,Sheldon,Oh did you hear that? We’re getting the friends and family discount. We are honoured and we will take it.
34740,Penny,Hey.
34741,Penny,Oh that’s amazing
34742,Sheldon,So what do you think?
34743,Leonard,Uh well it’s not May the fifth and it’s not May the third. It’s May the fourth.
34744,Sheldon,Excuse me. Hey how you doin’?
34745,Raj,Thank you.
34746,Howard,Spring wedding?
34747,Raj,Go out with me on one date and I promise you you’ll see.
34748,Sheldon,The same way any normal person would. I feel like I want to peel off my own face and tear it in two and then again and again until I have a handful of Sheldon-face confetti.
34749,Leonard,So we’re still getting married?
34750,Sheldon,Formal protest.
34751,Penny,Of course you did. Your hands are softer than veal.
34752,Sheldon,The question you should be asking is what is their problem with me? My first memory a hummingbird dive-bombing my stroller to get at the apple juice in my sippy cup.
34753,Penny,You only watch what you eat when you’re afraid you might have to take your shirt off.
34754,Leonard,Let’s just start the experiment.
34755,Penny,Yes.
34756,Penny,You know I’m not sure the manager hasn’t posted the schedule yet how about I let you know.
34757,Leonard,So Howard Wolowitz tying the knot. Leaving his crazy bachelor days behind. He was a wild one. Well I guess we all kind of were. I remember this one time I was with this girl at the beach. We were in the ocean and we started making out. I know it was crazy. I wasn’t even wearing my Aquasocks. Then…
34758,Howard,One of them broke up with you. Do you really want her telling the other one why?
34759,Penny,Oh you know you would just love that wouldn’t you? Yeah. You would just love to open up your little snake can and throw some money at the girl who can’t pay her bills.
34760,Penny,Hey babe you want to drive?
34761,Penny,Hey.
34762,Penny,Look I know you think I’m being reckless and you might be right but I need to take this shot.
34763,Leonard,Penny? What about her?
34765,Penny,Excuse me the word is polish. See? Small P.
34766,Sheldon,I’d feign modesty at this point but who would believe me? Still you need to consider how successful Leonard’s brother and sister are.
34767,Penny,I’m sorry I called it cute. Let’s watch another one.
34768,Penny,Uh I don’t know.
34769,Penny,I wish I felt more confident.
34770,Howard,Guys I’m not living in a garage.
34771,Sheldon,Only a suggestion. A catch in your throat would work just as well.
34772,Leonard,It wasn’t even very good. She was a smoker I’d just been seasick.
34773,Sheldon,We are?
34774,Sheldon,Well I’m just playing tennis against the drapes here.
34775,Howard,He’s right. Let’s make fun of his mother. Howard come rub my feet! My corns are killing me!
34776,Leonard,Hey guys what do you think? Priya took me clothes shopping.
34777,Penny,Oh thanks. Got a couple new outfits for work.
34778,Penny,Yeah well this is all the donkulous you’re gonna get.
34779,Sheldon,Not so fast. Infinite Sheldon.
34780,Leonard,Good-bye Mother.
34781,Sheldon,No.
34782,Sheldon,I’ve decided not to procreate.
34783,Penny,Um I’m free tonight.
34784,Howard,You can’t sink. With all that helium in you you’re lucky you don’t float away.
34785,Sheldon,Thank you. It would be an honour.
34786,Sheldon,Good. I don’t deserve cookies. Come in. Wil?
34787,Sheldon,She’s a dermatologist.
34788,Penny,Uh no. No no no you know congratulations I think you’ll make a great hooker.
34789,Howard,A second trip to space I’ll miss you.
34790,Sheldon,Do you prefer ointment or cream?
34791,Sheldon,Yes it’s “Penny get your own Wi-Fi.” No spaces.
34792,Penny,Shut up.
34793,Leonard,No he didn’t.
34794,Leonard,Would someone please turn off the Sheldon commentary track?
34795,Penny,I mean who even reads Scientific American?
34796,Leonard,Oh you too. Hey everyone this is my mother Beverley.
34797,Leonard,Well you know Penny and I have been talking about taking a weekend in Vegas. Maybe we should all go.
34798,Sheldon,Hello.
34799,Leonard,I’ve always been jealous of how much money Raj’s family has.
34800,Raj,I disagree. Penny is a strong independent woman. The more you try to control her the more she’ll push back.
34801,Sheldon,Did that conversation include the phrase your genitals are a joy to behold?
34802,Penny,Ooh this one looks nice.
34803,Penny,Well the “check engine” light is fine. It’s still blinking away. It’s the stupid engine that stopped working. It cost me like twelve hundred dollars to fix it.
34804,Sheldon,And here’s where we are. The runts in a large litter unlikely to ever reach the nourishing teats of Indiana Jones.
34805,Sheldon,Your questionnaire very disappointing.
34806,Sheldon,Well if you haven’t noticed I’ve been between them for the last ten years.
34807,Penny,How is that not talking to me like I’m an idiot? It’s my friend it’s my couch and it’s my freakin’ life!
34808,Leonard,I don’t know uh Casper the alcoholic ghost?
34809,Sheldon,It’s a rhetorical question. There is nothing more important than Wii bowling night.
34810,Penny,Telephone wires can’t electrocute you can they?
34811,Sheldon,That’s not true. Any colour’s fine with me. Yeah I could be a-a combination of blue and yellow.
34812,Raj,Downward-facing dog.
34813,Raj,How you feeling?
34814,Penny,Yeah.
34815,Penny,I think this all looks good.
34816,Leonard,Snipe.
34817,Leonard,Awesome!
34818,Raj,Just say it.
34819,Raj,No that’s okay. I’ll get it.
34820,Howard,Sheldon if you don’t like this stuff let’s just go next door and build her a bear.
34821,Sheldon,All right you have a wager.
34822,Sheldon,I understand we’re no longer a couple but I would like to remind you that we made a baby together.
34823,Sheldon,Hello.
34824,Sheldon,Amy I excel at many things but getting over you wasn’t one of them. I think I need to just be your friend.
34825,Sheldon,I take it back. I’m scared of turbulence!
34826,Penny,All right I’ll see what I can do. So three months at the North Pole. Wow that is awesome.
34827,Sheldon,Yes hello. I’m fine. Um I understand you may have a bad impression of me so I bought you a gift.
34828,Sheldon,Fascinating.
34829,Sheldon,All games are made up. They’re not found in nature. You don’t just dig in the ground come across a rich vein of Rock’em Sock’em Robots.
34830,Leonard,Sheldon my name’s on that paper too. There’s no upside to doing this.
34831,Sheldon,I can’t sleep on your couch. I sleep in a bed. And given it’s dimensions I have no intention of living out E.M. Snickering’s beloved children’s book  The Tall Man From Cornwall.
34832,Leonard,Yeah what?
34833,Howard,Thank you.
34834,Howard,You heard that Ladies’ Night ladies? We’re eventually coming for you!
34835,Penny,Really? Why?
34836,Leonard,Uh on the count of three both of you bounce the balls as hard as you can. The highest bounce wins the office.
34837,Raj,I buried it there so we could go home.
34838,Raj,No you wouldn’t. You’d be intimidated by my wealth and fame. My only friends would be my genetically engineered monkey butler and the little people I hired to be my living chess set.
34839,Raj,Oh. Something about latin music just makes me feel like I’m on a white sand beach in Rio.
34840,Raj,I have a hip-hop aerobics class at five could we go after?
34841,Leonard,Marriage is scary. You’re scared I’m scared. But it doesn’t make me not want to do it. It it just makes me want to hold your hand and do it with you.
34842,Raj,This means a lot.
34843,Sheldon,Remember the old days when I used to point out that your check engine light was on?
34845,Sheldon,How on earth can you say dirty sock and relax in the same sentence?
34846,Howard,Stop that? Okay.
34847,Penny,Well get it. Get it for me.
34848,Leonard,What’s your point? In order to keep having a sexual relationship with Penny I have to give up everything I believe in my intellectual integrity the very nature of who I am? I can’t do that Howard.
34849,Raj,You you’re kidding. That’s fantastic!
34850,Raj,Oh sure you can tell when Sheldon’s upset.
34851,Sheldon,So is that a yes?
34852,Raj,And I thought me having sex with Emily was gonna be the big news.
34853,Howard,Yeah come on this is great news and you know it.
34854,Sheldon,Oh I-I buffed them with Turtle Wax. The man down at Pep Boys says from now on the urine should just bead up and roll right off.
34855,Howard,He can’t figure out how to fix it.
34856,Sheldon,No we don’t. We have to take in nourishment expel waste and inhale enough oxygen to keep ourselves from dying everything else is optional.
34857,Sheldon,They call me a genius because I’m a genius. Tell Mom that I currently weigh 165 pounds and that I’m having regular bowel movements. Enjoy the wedding goodbye.
34858,Howard,Make way for the fastest man alive.  Oh no!
34859,Raj,Penny?
34860,Penny,We’ll all go.
34861,Howard,What are you drawing over there?
34862,Raj,He’s the Hindu version of Cupid but way better because he rides a giant parrot.
34863,Raj,Thank you Mummy I love you. Helicopters for everybody.
34864,Raj,Okay you’re right I got myself into this but I’ve never missed a Comic-Con with you guys.
34865,Penny,Thank you.
34866,Raj,Unbelievable. You have some nerve showing up here just to schmooze with the tenure committee.
34867,Leonard,This is the movie that big soda doesn’t want you to see.
34868,Sheldon,If this is about the night the heat went out there’s nothing to be embarrassed about.
34869,Raj,No.
34870,Sheldon,Well don’t feel bad. I think we’ve all been distracted since the girls entered our lives.
34871,Penny,Excuse me.
34872,Leonard,Sheldon…
34873,Howard,No way dude!
34874,Sheldon,I believe the appropriate metaphor here involves a river of excrement and a Native American water vessel without any means of propulsion.
34875,Penny,Yeah well it’s not gonna happen tonight. You know for the first time in my life I am not in a relationship and I’m totally okay with it.
34876,Leonard,Oh hey. You guys didn’t break up.
34877,Sheldon,Penny this would be a massive undertaking and my time is both limited and valuable.
34878,Leonard,We’re not giving him two Jet Skis.
34879,Howard,You know I read that washing dishes can be an excellent form of meditation. The key is that while washing the dishes one should only be washing the dishes.
34880,Leonard,Oh yeah.
34881,Leonard,Are you? You left your queen exposed from above you trapped your knight in the corner and you keep sighing and saying why me?
34882,Leonard,Oh then I think you’ll appreciate what I got you.
34883,Sheldon,What is there to gossip about? We barely have one.
34884,Leonard,Good one.
34885,Sheldon,Cobbler. I’m still laughing.
34886,Penny,Do you really think there’s reason to worry?
34887,Howard,Can you say it again for me?
34888,Penny,Okay listen just because Howard and Bernadette are having problems does not mean you should be here sniffing around.
34889,Leonard,Howard…
34890,Howard,Here we go House of a 1000 Corpses.
34891,Raj,Yeah me too.
34892,Sheldon,I sense you’re trying to tell me something.
34893,Sheldon,Pun intended?
34894,Leonard,It’s getting pretty late how come you’re still up?
34895,Penny,Wow are these Amy’s? Kind of trashy good for her.
34896,Penny,Leonard doesn’t snore.
34897,Raj,Is this what you do when I’m not here make really good points?
34898,Leonard,Well until you just said that mean thing kinda.
34900,Leonard,My Physics Bowl Trophy!  “Leonard is so smart Sheldon who?”
34901,Sheldon,Congratulations and welcome temporarily aboard. Here’s your I.D. Card your key and your lapel pin. Which Leonard was too cool to wear. FYI part of your responsibilities as roommate pro tem will be to drive me to and from work the comic book store the barbershop and the park for one hour every other Sunday for fresh air.
34902,Penny,Fine. Lately I kind of feel like you’ve been taking me for granted.
34903,Sheldon,Stuart now.
34904,Sheldon,I’ve invented a science joke would you like to hear it?
34905,Leonard,It was the best apartment I’d seen the rent was very reasonable and after you’ve passed the first three barriers you kind of want to take it all the way.
34906,Penny,Why?
34907,Raj,Oh God Look at this buffet. I love America.
34908,Sheldon,I’m kidding I packed it. It was a joke I was subverting the conversational expectations. I believe they call that the um old switcheroo.
34909,Raj,Hey. Good to see you.
34910,Raj,Pushover.
34911,Howard,Oh great. There go my chances of being sexually harassed.
34912,Penny,Um uh Stan Lee oh he was in those goofy kung fu movies you love so much?
34913,Penny,All right look just forget about the astronaut.
34914,Penny,Shh! Here comes my joke.
34915,Sheldon,She’s sick I knew it. Bye.
34916,Sheldon,Thank you again for dinner.
34917,Leonard,Sheldon?
34918,Leonard,Why am I the one that has to get rid of him?
34919,Raj,Me too. Good times.
34921,Sheldon,I informed you thusly.
34922,Leonard,Why at my place?
34923,Leonard,Oh you brought your own lunch. Good for you.
34924,Sheldon,I don’t want to hug you.
34925,Leonard,Lesley I would like to propose an experiment.
34926,Sheldon,Yeah I actually have information about Raj that would be helpful with this discussion.
34927,Penny,I’m so glad you guys are friends again.
34928,Raj,You’re right. This is beneath me. Lie your mother was last night.
34929,Leonard,I don’t want tea.
34930,Howard,Oh he’s really good with her.
34931,Penny,Also no.
34932,Sheldon,How would you put it?
34933,Sheldon,Ah Sweden. Yeah home of my favourite Muppet and uh second favourite meatball. Okay the Nordic reputation for lack of humour is well-founded. Boy is his name Gunderson or No-Funderson?
34935,Sheldon,I believe I’m hearing some negativity on the factory floor.
34936,Penny,Okay I got this lock and load boys.
34937,Penny,Hey I’m a famous actress living in London.
34938,Leonard,He is?
34939,Leonard,Uh okay well um I got married recently.
34940,Penny,Maybe we should just call it a night.
34941,Raj,How’s that going?
34942,Penny,We should have let him go to bed.
34943,Leonard,Mmm. Mmm.
34945,Leonard,Hey.
34946,Leonard,Aw I got a little paper cut.
34947,Penny,That’s so sweet.
34948,Sheldon,What’s odd is they’re in the trash can.
34949,Penny,No thanks.
34950,Leonard,Doesn’t matter. He’s headed for the kitchen anyway.
34951,Leonard,I swear he is never ever playing with my helicopter.
34952,Penny,It’s just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you’ve just met.
34953,Leonard,Aw screw it. I’m in.
34954,Sheldon,Every year. I told you wear a diaper.
34955,Leonard,Buddy.
34956,Sheldon,Why not? Penny did it.
34957,Penny,Okay that time you looked at me.
34958,Leonard,Interesting question. On the one hand I always thought…
34959,Penny,I can start.
34960,Sheldon,Is that a dog?
34961,Howard,What?
34962,Leonard,Why?
34963,Sheldon,You are in a forest. There is quicksand to the west a path leads to the east. Go east. An iron gate blocks your way. Open gate. It’s locked. Hmm well so much for that.
34964,Howard,Yes. Arlene. She wrote no way on both our cappuccinos.
34965,Sheldon,Penny all my life I have been uncomfortable with the sort of physical contact that comes easily to others hand-shaking hugging prostate exams. But I’m working on it you know? Just recently I had to put VapoRub on Amy’s chest. A year ago that would have been unthinkable.
34966,Penny,Yes we know.
34967,Sheldon,How can you not know? I just told you. Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?
34968,Leonard,I’m doing this to be a good neighbour. In any case there’s no way it could lower the odds.
34969,Leonard,Yeah. Well we work at the same place as you and we’ve always been fine.
34970,Raj,No.
34971,Sheldon,But…
34972,Leonard,Penny’s on the phone with her.
34973,Leonard,No.
34974,Raj,Now that Sheldon’s across the hall have you decided what you’re doing with his old room?
34975,Leonard,Aaah for God’s sake Sheldon you are driving me crazy.
34976,Penny,Yeah you pick that bone. You pick that bone clean!
34977,Leonard,Oh yeah. No. Thanks that would be great help. You realize you might kill some of them.
34978,Penny,Yeah.
34979,Leonard,Hey Olsen twins…
34980,Sheldon,Of course.
34981,Sheldon,Then speak.
34982,Penny,Oh!
34983,Penny,Oh that is so romantic.
34984,Raj,Congratulations you are the proud owner of a miniature time machine.
34985,Penny,Oh.
34986,Penny,Now?
34987,Leonard,Eh.
34988,Raj,Good for Sheldon deciding to stay with Amy on her birthday.
34989,Raj,It’s it’s beautiful.
34990,Leonard,I didn’t have to take him for ice cream.
34991,Penny,Are Leonard and Priya here?
34992,Raj,Sorry boys. Say hi to your mother when she picks you up. Or I could just tell her later tonight! We pwned them dude! Up top!
34993,Sheldon,Well I thought if I have a stroke or a kidney stone who would I want to share that with?
34994,Leonard,You see Kandor was the capital city of the planet Krypton it was miniaturised by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by Superman.
34995,Penny,No it’s my brother’s. I’m trying to help him get a job out here.
34996,Leonard,Yeah.
34997,Leonard,Better than okay. I am having the game of my life.
34998,Leonard,I was afraid he was gonna eat me.
34999,Howard,You know he might not reopen. He didn’t get a lot of money from the insurance company.
35000,Raj,Like who?
35001,Leonard,It’s not just the date. We haven’t talked about anything. Big wedding small wedding indoor outdoor?
35002,Sheldon,Just tea. S’the best tea I’ve ever had.
35003,Leonard,Wow. You really make science come alive.
35004,Sheldon,You’ve already signed something Brent Spiner. Your name on my list. From this moment on you are my mortal enemy.
35005,Leonard,Hey.
35006,Howard,No no you’re pregnant. The only thing you carry is our hope for a better tomorrow.
35007,Leonard,Exactly. But this is not a date. So I ask again would you like anything?
35008,Penny,You knocked more than usual.
35009,Sheldon,That girl needs to get a life.
35010,Howard,So we tell him she’s a lesbian right?
35011,Sheldon,And get this I saw an articulating ladder with dual-leg leveling which delivers stability and adaptability to uneven terrain.
35012,Raj,Well crime-scene photos near your crib spring to mind.
35013,Leonard,Isn’t that flammable?
35014,Sheldon,Whoa. Nobody said anything about watching the game.
35015,Leonard,So there’s gonna be some furniture delivered?
35016,Sheldon,Well now that.
35017,Sheldon,I need your opinion on a matter of semiotics.
35018,Sheldon,Danger danger.
35019,Howard,Dude she said she wants to slow things down.
35020,Penny,Uh-huh!
35021,Leonard,They’re graduating.
35022,Sheldon,I’m not wearing this visor to play women’s golf.
35023,Raj,Really? Cool.
35024,Raj,Oh I think we’re doing just fine thank you.
35025,Sheldon,Eh I don’t know. I am her precious little boy. And you did take my flower.
35026,Leonard,Or loud noises clowns and nuns.
35027,Howard,Please hurry.
35028,Leonard,A big kiss. On the mouth.
35029,Penny,Of course.
35030,Sheldon,Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper and welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun With Flags. You may notice that I’m holding a remote control. That’s because my cameraperson and co-host Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler has chosen to end her relationship with me. I’m going to pause here to let that sink in. Okay. If you need to pause a little longer just click the pause button. But the show must go on. And thankfully all the things my girlfriend used to do can be taken care of with my right hand. Anyway let’s not spend any more time talking about her. We’re here to talk about flags. Tonight’s theme flags of countries that have been torn apart and the women I have a feeling were responsible.
35031,Leonard,So I’ve got a gunshot wound. That’s pretty badass.
35032,Leonard,You think they’ll still go on the trip?
35033,Penny,So what did we miss?
35034,Penny,Yeah I said Leonard.
35035,Sheldon,It’s not what it looks like. It’s not what it looks like.
35036,Howard,Very basic.
35037,Penny,And what? Your wizard robes are next to go.
35038,Sheldon,Go on.
35039,Raj,Oh get over yourself it’s a high-tech toilet.
35040,Sheldon,I was using the bathroom.
35042,Leonard,Thank you for your time.
35043,Sheldon,This is Stephanie’s facebook page. Now where it should say in a relationship what does it say?
35044,Howard,Ooh somebody took pictures and uploaded them to their Flickr account.
35045,Penny,I’m still mad at you.
35046,Sheldon,What an interesting question. When I was a child life was confusing and chaotic for me and trains represented order. I could line them up categorize them control them. I guess you could say that they gave me a sense of calm in a world that didn’t.
35047,Raj,I’m busy.
35048,Leonard,No but I don’t have three years to make that gate feel sorry for me.
35049,Penny,Uh yeah no that’s not it.
35050,Howard,Dude! I put that thing on my face!
35051,Leonard,Come on let’s just start walking. There’s got to be a gas station or something nearby.
35052,Leonard,I think what Sheldon’s trying to say is that Sagittarius wouldn’t have been our first guess.
35053,Raj,I really like my saber-toothed cat. Thank you.
35054,Leonard,I don’t know. It’s a fat guy on a Segway. That’s funny everywhere.
35055,Sheldon,Irrelevant. Leonard doesn’t trim his nose hair. He thinks because he’s short nobody can see up there.
35056,Penny,Anything else?
35057,Sheldon,If you think that’s more fun than talking to Zachary Quinto through a stall door you’re crazy.
35058,Leonard,This should be fun.
35059,Penny,Yeah.
35060,Penny,Well it’s like that science thing. For every action you have a gigantic and annoying reaction.
35061,Leonard,Just for the record I did not want to be a part of this.
35062,Leonard,Don’t you think if a woman was living with me I’d be the first one to know about it?
35063,Sheldon, Let me point out that two degrees can be the difference between water and steam.
35064,Raj,Like how women often forget the pain of childbirth.
35065,Raj,How can I call her you know I can’t talk to women.
35066,Raj,You don’t have to you should want to.
35068,Sheldon,See? Why don’t I believe you?
35069,Leonard,Who was the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce?
35070,Raj,That’s exactly what she said. How do you know that?
35071,Howard,Well I’d like to point out I voted for orang-utan but you shouted me down. .
35072,Leonard,I swear I am on your side.
35073,Raj,Thank you. That’s why I say Keaton’s number one. He brought a sense of humour to the role.
35074,Sheldon,Playing the theremin.
35075,Howard,Bye Cinnamon. Be a good girl.
35076,Sheldon,Gary Con do we fly or drive? Do we wear costumes? And if so who gets to be Gary?
35077,Sheldon,Oh hi Stephanie.
35078,Leonard,Hey Penny when uh when’s your birthday?
35079,Raj,All right hold on. I’m gonna drive like we do in India. Get out of my way you syphilitic dogs.
35080,Leonard,I sure hope so.
35081,Sheldon,Why not?
35082,Leonard,Batman finally came to your party.
35083,Penny,That bitch!
35084,Leonard,Well change plaque to mixed-race couple and you are my grandma.
35085,Leonard,That’s amazing.
35086,Leonard,No one’s getting tortured.
35087,Penny,Mind explaining to me why you were being such a jerk at the restaurant?
35088,Penny,All right then we’re gonna have to go with an oldie but goodie making a scene.
35089,Leonard,Yup.
35090,Sheldon,Hello.
35091,Sheldon,Well that’s a delightful little story but our arrangement was that you sit here and not say anything I answer the questions.
35092,Sheldon,What stimulus should we introduce it to first? Light sound temperature oh oh let’s
35093,Howard,We were having a conversation about past lovers.
35094,Leonard,I don’t know what to say.
35095,Sheldon,I did this for free let me get a little something.
35096,Sheldon,Yes it’s six against one. Stand down sir.
35097,Penny,Ooh Sheldon it’s as if you don’t think I’ll punch you.
35098,Leonard,Got any advice?
35099,Howard,Okay deal.
35100,Howard,We are. We are. Oh no. What a terrible serve. Sorry brother.
35101,Leonard,I can’t decide whether I want Stan Lee to autograph my Journey into Mystery 83 first appearance of Thor or my Fantastic Four number five first appearance of Dr. Doom. 
35102,Sheldon,I thought I was getting better at it but clearly I’m not.
35103,Leonard,Oh. Genius here wants to catch a bird with a garbage bag and a Slim Jim.
35104,Penny,So you’re like one of those beautiful mind genius guys.
35105,Leonard,What?
35106,Penny,You want me to throw him out?
35107,Sheldon,You guys are the worst. Thank you I think that was helpful.
35108,Leonard,What did you do?
35109,Sheldon,I agree. It’s the juxtaposition of the high-tech nature of space exploration against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet that provides the comic fodder here. Check your messages.
35110,Leonard,That long huh?
35111,Raj,I don’t know where your pants are but we did find your underwear in a pot on the stove.
35112,Penny,Okay.
35113,Leonard,Yes.
35114,Sheldon,Actually I have a plastic baggy strapped to my leg that says I can. Give up Wolowitz. You’ve chosen to tangle with a superior intellect you can’t defeat. There is nothing you could possibly do to… 
35115,Leonard,How about that? Sheldon’s being reasonable.
35116,Leonard,Okay here we go. You find yourselves in the smoking remains of Santa’s village. Clearly a great battle has taken place.
35117,Sheldon,Well who would ever guess that?
35118,Raj,Here let me try. You’re right it doesn’t turn the other way.
35119,Howard,Yoo-hoo! Over here!
35120,Penny,Okay I’m at the gate to the Treasury of the Ancients I’m going in.
35121,Penny,How come?
35122,Leonard,Yeah. That’s the spirit.
35123,Leonard,No.
35124,Penny,Worst bedtime story ever.
35125,Sheldon,Couple things actually. Your tone of voice your body language…
35126,Howard,Oh if only I had his confidence. I have such difficulty speaking to women. Or around women. Or at times even effeminate men.
35127,Penny,Alright my boss says you either have to order or leave and never come back.
35128,Penny,Okay okay look if this is about yesterday Leonard I am really sorry about what I said I was just a bit upset.
35129,Sheldon,Oh no no. That’s not going to happen no. What I need you to do is find a Valentine’s gift for my girlfriend.
35130,Penny,Well since Amy’s going do you want me there? You know to support you?
35131,Penny,Uh from Stuart at the comic-book store.
35132,Leonard,Sure but let’s go out here where there’s a little less yelling and guilt. What’s up?
35133,Leonard,No gym shorts that can be yanked down.
35134,Leonard,Sure sure. How did you get into this place?
35135,Leonard,They never do.
35136,Howard,Oh. You poor thing. You have one arrow in your quiver and you just can’t use it. Fortunately another pathway to a man’s heart is through his stomach.
35137,Penny,I’m sorry. I’m not here.
35138,Leonard,Interrupting physi…
35139,Leonard,Hey Sheldon are you coming?
35140,Leonard,Hold on to that thought. 
35141,Penny,Well I always figured it was to study us discover our weaknesses and report back to your alien overlords.
35142,Raj,Not me I’m a hundred percent honest in all of my relationships.
35143,Raj,Ooh ooh! What about we make your astronaut nickname Howard “Buzz” Wolowitz?
35144,Sheldon,Of course. He will hear it as an attempt to mend fences as opposed to the withering condemnation you and I will know it to be.
35145,Sheldon,Won’t it also be weird if I have to say hello to you every morning on my way to work and you’re living in a refrigerator box and washing your hair with rain water?
35146,Sheldon,Why?
35147,Howard,Fine you want something to do? There’s about six months of data on this hard drive. Why don’t you go through it and see if you can spot any patterns or anomalies.
35148,Sheldon,Amy this isn’t easy to say. All relationships are difficult but even more so when you’re in one with a person who struggles with everyday social interactions. And frankly who can strike some people as being kind of a weirdo.
35149,Penny,And you wonder why other children beat you with books. Cheers!
35150,Raj,Yes but she doesn’t. So get signing hand monkey.
35151,Leonard,I don’t want to talk about it. You didn’t catch bugs from Penny’s chair.
35152,Leonard,I’ve had her brisket. Melts in your mouth.
35153,Sheldon,Oh you’re going to a wedding alone? That’s sad.
35154,Howard,Who wants hot cinnamon rolls?
35155,Raj,I want to apologize for Amy last night. She was completely out of line. Are you are you not speaking to me or did the screen freeze again?
35156,Raj,No I’m gonna brush Cinnamon’s teeth.
35157,Sheldon,Penny this is your enterprise so it’s ultimately your decision but based on the quality of his work I’d strongly recommend that we let Leonard go.
35158,Leonard,And for Rajesh Koothrappali from whose homeland these tasty dishes originate one large order of chicken McNuggets.
35159,Penny,It’s not about shoes.
35160,Howard,You’re so full of it.
35161,Sheldon,Yes. Like we’re on a ship. Coming from Africa to America.
35162,Penny,I’m sorry I have a boyfriend. In fact there he is now. Ready to go sweetheart?
35164,Raj,Yes very nice.
35165,Sheldon,Vociferously?
35166,Leonard,We’re leaving now!
35167,Raj,I was thinking we could watch a DVD.
35168,Penny,Well so does Leonard. It’s kind of annoying but it’s not the end of the world.
35169,Penny,Well you’ll be happy to know I just spoke to Zack and he’s willing to sign the court papers. He’s on his way here now.
35170,Sheldon,Well don’t get me wrong. Neurobiology’s nothing more than the science of gray squishy stuff. But you know when it connects to physics gas up the Ford Martha we’re going for a drive.
35171,Sheldon,I have to say I slept splendidly. Granted not long but just deeply and well.
35172,Raj,Although I knew the line doesn’t make me Nathan Fillion.
35173,Howard,Maybe this time he’s going to do it.
35174,Leonard,You really think I belong with Benedict Arnold and Judas?
35175,Penny,Well why don’t you go to a coffee shop.
35176,Sheldon,The horror!
35177,Sheldon,I’ll be able to return to work tomorrow.
35178,Howard,May I present live from New Delhi Dr and Mrs V. M. Koothrappali.
35179,Raj,That’s nice. I haven’t had much success meeting people online.
35180,Penny,So Leonard how about it?
35181,Penny,Well I went over to Mike’s to make up with him.
35182,Leonard,Oh. Done and done.
35183,Howard,What’s wrong with you?
35184,Leonard,Got it.
35185,Sheldon,Oh yes. In fact I improved upon it.
35186,Sheldon,Walked right out the door.
35187,Howard,Like who?
35189,Sheldon,No Leonard this is going to haunt me for the rest of my life. Every science classroom every periodic table every textbook this mistake will be staring back at me. Like that time you let Koothrappali wax your eyebrows. I’ve got to find a way to stop this thing.
35190,Leonard,Sheldon what is it?
35191,Leonard,We know we know because burning something down for the insurance money is a crime.
35192,Penny,No six thirty’s great.
35193,Sheldon,Oh a clever albeit obsolete euphemism for insufficient blood flow to the male sex organ.
35194,Sheldon,Godzilla clause?
35195,Penny,Okay yeah.
35196,Raj,Goth food.
35197,Leonard,Of course I would never make fun of you.
35198,Raj,Well come on we won’t tell anyone.
35199,Penny,Yeah well I have street smarts.
35200,Leonard,Well no not socially. But you know just at work.
35201,Leonard,None of that is true.
35202,Raj,Hey guys.
35204,Penny,Blah blah blah a typical Taurus. So seriously are we going to see you Saturday?
35205,Raj,Baloney okay? You two are as afraid of hurting someone’s feelings as I am.
35206,Sheldon,No sir no I took my dad’s desk chair attached a Speak & Spell to it and made my sister push me up and down the block to trick or treat. Granted most people thought I was R2-D2 but still I got a lot of candy.
35207,Sheldon,Where were you that’s more important than Wii bowling night?
35208,Penny,Oh thanks. They are cute aren’t they?
35209,Sheldon,I do. I have the drive to the hospital right here. That is if you make it to the car without falling down the stairs. And don’t expect me to carry you I do that enough in life.
35210,Penny,Okay I’m confused. Which one is Mr. Robot?
35211,Penny,You are so funny.
35212,Leonard,That’s fine ’cause actually you’re not invited.
35213,Howard,I know she’s so thoughtful.
35214,Howard,Well I guess it goes back to when I was a fat kid in India and didn’t have any friends.
35215,Leonard,I just know the longer we wait to talk about it the weirder it gets.
35216,Howard,We went to the comic book store last night.
35217,Leonard,Are you an element in the actinoid series?
35218,Penny,It’s a chocolate chip cookie.
35219,Leonard,If Sheldon’s testosterone dipped he’d become a butterfly.  Oh. Maybe someone’s here to apologize.
35220,Leonard,Can I sit in your spot?
35221,Leonard,Hold on. Wil and Amy had an argument?
35222,Sheldon,Mmm not bad. You know in medieval times idle chatter was punished with a device called the scold’s bridle. It’s an iron cage that’s locked around the head and pierces the tongue.
35223,Leonard,Hey you’re in a good mood.
35224,Sheldon,Wait. They might be hostile.
35225,Penny,I can’t remember a time you guys weren’t in my life.
35226,Sheldon,I’m trying to take more of an interest in other people’s lives.
35227,Sheldon,To the comic book store. You’re probably thinking the comic book store? On a Thursday? Why I’ve fallen down the rabbit hole and into a land of madness. What you have failed to take into account Penny is that this is Anything Can Happen Thursday.
35228,Leonard,No no of course not. Just have your relationship someplace else.
35229,Leonard,No.
35230,Sheldon,Hello.
35231,Penny,Okay I’ll get those drinks started for you.
35232,Raj,There’s a new sports bar over on Colorado Ave…
35233,Leonard,Are we gonna be much longer? I really have to go to the bathroom.
35234,Howard,You could power down.
35235,Raj,Okay uh let’s get things started. Um why don’t we go around the room say your name and why you broke up with me. Want to kick it off?
35236,Penny,We heard you read the letter from Howard’s father.
35237,Sheldon,Because as it just so happens I’m also spending the day with a beloved children’s television science personality. Isn’t that right new friend and colleague Bill Nye the Science Guy. Sorry I replaced you with a newer model.
35238,Howard,Okay. Here’s where we derive the mass of the dark matter particle.
35239,Raj,Let me ask you a question. Do you believe you’re going to go to hell for eating sweet and sour pork?
35240,Sheldon,It’s a blindingly clever play on words. By appropriating his character’s name and adding the S we imply that we we’ll be the crushers of Wesley.
35241,Leonard,Oh I’ll make a motion but you’re not going to like it.
35242,Sheldon,Yes.
35243,Sheldon,I believe you. I’d believe you more if you threw a few Apple Jacks in here.
35244,Leonard,Baby’s listening.
35245,Penny,I can’t believe it. This whole time a small part of me thought he was lying.
35246,Raj,Oh oh uh looks like they’re getting ready to let people in.
35247,Leonard,Who forgot to crack the window?
35248,Sheldon,Well that last Hunger Games was not my cup of tea.
35249,Howard,Well I’ve been quite enjoying that. It combines all the superhero fun of Spider-Man with all the body-switching shenanigans of Freaky Friday. Both versions original and Lohan.
35250,Leonard,Did you get the part?
35251,Leonard,I’m getting enraged.
35252,Sheldon,In fact I want you to keep the apartment flag and I’m not just saying that because it touched your genitals.
35253,Sheldon,How late?
35254,Raj,What the balls is forty-three?
35255,Penny,Oh come on we’ll be quiet.
35256,Leonard,I guess he just hates fun.
35258,Raj,What a douche.
35259,Leonard,Snort it down and keep eating!
35260,Howard,Why are you being like this?
35262,Sheldon,Why not?
35263,Leonard,No no no no no. You just need you just need you just need to map it out. Come on I’ll help you. So uh you stopped at the stream and you turned north three times?
35264,Sheldon,How did you deal with it?
35265,Howard,I will take that action.
35266,Raj,Okay how about you just dip your toe in and meet one of them?
35267,Sheldon,He just left another comment.
35268,Leonard,I’m good I’m good to go.
35269,Sheldon,He went to the movies without me. It was the only option. I’m sorry I don’t understand which social situation this is. Could you give me some guidance as to how to proceed?
35270,Sheldon,Oh no. Mrs. Mary Cooper didn’t raise her no liars.
35271,Leonard,Why would you say you wanted to go if you didn’t?
35272,Sheldon,No. Anyway when I was eight a Montgomery-Ward delivery van ran over our cat Lucky.
35273,Raj,You see I was at the doctor’s office the folder was right there so I took a peek.
35275,Leonard,Not yet.
35276,Sheldon,I did. You know I’m not even sure how accurate it was. I took it to the train store it said everyone was sad.
35277,Sheldon,You just got off the list. Would you like back on it? This’ll just take a moment. It’s on a five and a quarter inch floppy.
35278,Leonard,Just play a potion card.
35279,Sheldon,Building on building on that there’s a new build-your-own pizza place on Colorado.
35280,Penny,Hey.
35281,Penny,Where did that even come from did he say we were?
35282,Leonard,Um uh uh uh we don’t have an appointment and and we don’t belong here but we we’re like crazy-big fans. I mean uh buh buh crazy for Star Wars crazy not crazy like we have a backpack full of duct tape although we do have a backpack that you really don’t want to look in.
35283,Penny,What? No!
35284,Leonard,All right but just for the record I checked in with you to see how you’d feel about it.
35286,Sheldon,It’s happening. Leonard it’s happening. Professor Proton is coming to our house.
35287,Penny,All right hey you two we’re here for Howard right now okay?
35288,Howard,Yeah yeah a little.
35289,Penny,So all we need to do is get Sheldon knocked up.
35290,Penny,No one ever bought me drinks at a bar because my brain just popped out of my shirt.
35291,Penny,Twenty six hundred years?
35292,Leonard,Oh. We’re scientists.
35293,Leonard,What were you doing at Penny’s?
35294,Howard,Go. 
35295,Sheldon,Yeah I thought so too but she’s acting very strangely. I was discussing it with a Sri Lankan fellow on the bus and he hypothesized that a tiger may have recently run across her shadow. Although he may have just been trying to drum up business for his brother-in-law’s witch doctor practice.
35296,Howard,Hey how about we stay the night and hit Legoland in the morning?
35297,Sheldon,Ooh somebody call the burn ward. And back to the zone.
35298,Leonard,No her bed kind of… broke.
35299,Penny,Ew.
35300,Raj,Yes I’m very hopeful. Hello Missy.  They mentioned there may be side effects.
35301,Penny,Oh that’s nice.
35302,Sheldon,Why didn’t you get extra peanut sauce? We can both play this game.
35303,Raj,Well I’ve been thinking about you. How are you doing? Are you happy Mummy?
35304,Sheldon,Hu-u-urgh! Leonard not jealous.
35305,Sheldon,You mean your acting career?
35306,Sheldon,This might be a good time to point out Howard that friendship requires a certain give and take. Hold the door!
35307,Sheldon,It doesn’t matter.
35308,Penny,Bye.
35309,Raj,Well when someone looks at your dating profile the first thing they see is your picture. I just want to make sure you look fun and full of life and not like a body they just pulled out of the river. All right here we go and smile. Okay uh-uh that one’s in the bank. How about this? Turn away and then turn back into it. But when you do imagine the camera is the girl you want to meet.
35310,Leonard,That’s not true.
35311,Leonard,That’s very sweet. But we were thinking more of us maybe living together with… not you.
35312,Sheldon,And of course the answer is Technetium.
35313,Howard,You don’t want strippers? You’re the king of strippers. The one club in North Hollywood named a pole after you.
35314,Leonard,She really is.
35315,Raj,Spring wedding?
35316,Leonard,Oh I don’t know. I kind of promised myself I’d get off the computer be more physically active. Get some exercise.
35317,Sheldon,Why?
35318,Raj,Why don’t I just tell you what I heard today.
35319,Sheldon,I’m sorry it’s the bad boy attitude that comes with this hair.
35320,Leonard,What to you is a large crowd?
35321,Penny,We’ll pack up your stuff and meet you at the hospital.
35322,Howard,What do you think the problem is?
35323,Sheldon,It’s like talking to a chimp.
35324,Leonard,Hi.
35325,Howard,But someone joined our page. We have an actual fan.
35326,Penny,Who’s Professor Proton?
35327,Leonard,You changed the address on the building? What about mail?
35328,Sheldon,You know also if they did have coitus we’ll all be needing a skilled psychiatrist.
35330,Leonard,I think what Penny meant is the thought of you two in a mine is kind of funny it’s like a cat riding a Roomba.
35331,Sheldon,Yeah you know what’s not normal? Blubbering about emotions during a flag show. Unless that emotion is excitement over New Zealand changing their flag. Yeah good luck you crazy Kiwis we’re rooting for you.
35332,Sheldon,Oh wait stop that.
35333,Leonard,What’s neat is that they can maintain angular momentum indefinitely.
35334,Penny,Uh I’m Penny. I’m his neighbour.
35335,Sheldon,Remarkable. Aren’t you worried about secondhand smoke?
35336,Sheldon,Looks like that laptop’s seen better days. If you’re interested I’m selling this. It’s only two years old 16 gigabytes of RAM Intel core i7 processor and I can personally guarantee it has spent less than 20 minutes resting on an astronaut’s penis.
35337,Sheldon,You’re right.
35338,Sheldon,You’re biologists. Biology is the study of living things. That’s a living thing get cracking.
35339,Raj,Of course. I’d be happy to shred it on my ax.
35340,Leonard,Keep going buddy you’re doing great.
35341,Howard,Oh my God I’m crying already.
35342,Penny,Okay come on. We are not old boring people. We can do better than this.
35343,Leonard,You know I think this is a good stopping point. Uh it’s your first real game. I threw a lot of information at you.
35344,Penny,Hi.
35345,Penny,Ready to get started?
35346,Leonard,Probably not.
35347,Leonard,Yeah. I said no.
35348,Leonard,I made your favourite. Pizza bagels.
35349,Sheldon, Penny.
35350,Penny,Sheldon you big weirdo I want you to know that I love that you’re in my life.
35351,Howard,As a matter of fact I do. I’m gonna comfort her because I’m a caring and decent friend who’s happy to be there when she needs someone to talk to.
35352,Raj,Got him. When Gandhi advocated his philosophy of non-violence I bet he didn’t know how much fun it was killing stuff.
35353,Leonard,It was before my growth spurt.
35354,Penny,See? Right there. You’re a grown man you should be able to pick whichever hobbit you want. Wish you wouldn’t but one problem at a time.
35355,Sheldon,Precisely I didn’t do anything. Now does someone feel like checking her emotional math?
35356,Howard,No. We are very wealthy. But the only difference is we have more servants.
35357,Penny,Want of understanding? What does that even mean?
35358,Penny,What? Why me?
35359,Leonard,Great.
35360,Raj,When I’m feeling low I have sex with a girl. But that’s just me.
35361,Sheldon,I am truly sorry for what happened last night I take full responsibility. And I hope that it won’t colour your opinion of Leonard who is not only a wonderful guy but also I hear a gentle and thorough lover.  I did what I could.
35362,Leonard,What about if you went out with me?
35363,Leonard,I can’t believe we actually did it.
35364,Leonard,Yeah you do. You dog you.
35365,Sheldon,Or you might think she thinks you think it’s a date even though she doesn’t.
35366,Raj,Hey.
35367,Sheldon,Yes well apparently neither does anyone else.
35368,Raj,Hey. Where are the guys?
35369,Leonard,Cats Sheldon. You’re clearly upset about Amy being gone and you’re trying to replace her with a bunch of cats.
35370,Leonard,Actually no he goes to the bathroom at eight a.m. with optional follow-ups at one forty-five and seven ten high-fibre Fridays.
35371,Penny,Great.
35372,Leonard,This is delicious. Where’d you learn to make chili?
35373,Sheldon,Aren’t you worried that sitting in the lobby for a long period of time might attract the attention of the hotel detective?
35374,Sheldon,Oh great. She’s smart insightful and she has a very unique way of you know revering me.
35375,Penny,Look come on Amy look let us make it up to you. We’ll have a girl’s night we’ll do whatever you want.
35376,Penny,Oh wow is the evening over.
35377,Sheldon,Well I’m not going to dignify that with a response.
35378,Howard,If you want you can find out right now.
35379,Penny,You know I’m a big believer in breaking bad news to a guy when you’re in bed with him. That’s how I told my high school boyfriend I slept with his brother. That’s how I told his brother the same thing.
35380,Sheldon,Regardless coronary problems are eminently treatable. What’s more likely going to kill Howard’s mother are the antibiotic-resistant super-bugs festering in every nook and cranny of this hospital.
35381,Sheldon,No no no. I’m really good at this. All right give me a hint. Does it involve difficulty initiating a stream of anything?
35382,Leonard,No no no Amy wait. I know it’s not the night you had in mind but why don’t you guys stay and play with us? It’ll be fun.
35383,Raj,Yeah well I don’t like bugs okay? They freak me out.
35384,Howard,Because when I use my regular voice I feel like I’m making fun of them.
35385,Sheldon,Terrific. Now all that’s left is for you to invite me to come me to ask are you sure you to say absolutely and then me to bring it home with how could I say no to that face?
35386,Howard,Look I get it but before we pass up on an incredible opportunity I was thinking about when Howard was training to go to space they put him in a simulated environment.
35387,Sheldon,If you do that i’ll win in eight moves. I’ll win in five moves. I’ll win in one move.
35388,Sheldon,Beverley you know I hold you in high esteem. Can we skip the part where you pretend not to know the answer and get to the part where you tell me the answer?
35389,Sheldon,You’re lactose intolerant.
35390,Leonard,Fine but don’t expect my help.
35391,Raj,We’re not kicking him out. Stuart and I have become good friends.
35392,Raj,Uh look you and I haven’t made any commitments to each other.
35393,Penny,Are you kidding me?
35394,Leonard,Huh! Sorry!
35395,Leonard,Screw it I’m going.
35396,Penny,We don’t even know what time they’re gonna be there.
35397,Howard,Well prepare to be mortified. I let my dog eat food out of my mouth not because she likes it but because I do. Also I know they’re pretty but I’m scared of butterflies.
35398,Penny,Oh I forgot to tell you we’re gonna meet up with Bernadette to spy on Amy and her date.
35399,Penny,Mm-hmm.
35400,Raj,A-All right um how about this. When when Winnie the Pooh got his head stuck in the honey tree his friends all grabbed onto him and pulled and pulled.
35401,Raj,Well you say it like it’s easy. Have any one of you ever broken up with anyone?
35402,Sheldon,What? I apologized and I meant it. I know that we don’t play this game very often but you’re doing it wrong.
35403,Leonard,You’re ten seconds away from getting crushed. Nine eight.
35404,Penny,Oh gee dad Leonard can’t stay. He just dropped by to say hello. Thanks for stopping by sweetie. I’ll see you later.  Bye.
35405,Penny,Hmm.
35406,Penny,I want you right now to give me your 100% honest opinion.
35407,Leonard,You want me to get eye surgery?
35408,Leonard,All I’m saying is if they took all the money they spent trying to make a decent Hulk movie they could probably just make an actual Hulk.
35409,Howard,Bees talk to each other by dancing. Whales have their songs.
35410,Leonard,Don’t you think looking for a new city to live in is a bit of an overreaction?
35411,Leonard,Like what?
35412,Penny,I couldn’t even think of anyone else while you were gone.
35413,Howard,Uh it’s tonight but it’s first-come first-served so we should probably get there early and wait in line.
35414,Sheldon,We make everyone feel awkward. That’s our thing.
35415,Sheldon,Okay let’s do this.
35416,Raj,Come on Sheldon open the door.
35417,Howard,Okay well how about this? From the university Web site 7pm to 10pm Norton Hall Multipurpose Room mixer for grad students and faculty of the science and humanities departments. Whether you split atoms or infinitives this is the place to be.
35418,Sheldon,All right one bacon cheeseburger breaking two Jewish dietary restrictions simultaneously kudos. Beer-battered fish and chips. Now here’s your tartar sauce. I also brought you salsa. It’s a little unconventional but I think you’ll like it. It’s zingy. And for you Factory Burrito Grande no cheese no sour cream no ugly consequences from your lactose intolerance. Bon appétit.
35419,Raj,Your big problem is me telling her.
35421,Penny,Yeah and we’ll be right across the hall.
35422,Penny,Anyway she got here today and she’s just been in my apartment yakkety-yakking about every guy she’s slept with in Omaha which is basically every guy in Omaha and washing the sluttiest collection of underwear you have ever seen in my bathroom sink.
35423,Penny,Oh I’ll tell you what’s going on that stupid self-centred bastard wrote about our sex life in his blog. 
35424,Leonard,Wasn’t the answer Sheldon’s spot?
35425,Leonard,What you working on?
35426,Howard,How about the girl from the Wonder Years?
35427,Sheldon,I formally request sanctuary.
35428,Leonard,Do not need a break.
35429,Sheldon,I’ve been meaning to ask you do you think we should make a call about that?
35430,Sheldon,Yes.
35431,Penny,You know what? Give me the dice I want to roll.
35432,Howard,No.
35433,Sheldon,Well if you’d like we could call him. I mean that you could call him. As I’ve explained the absence of my friends does not cause me pain. As rock and roll bad boy Paul Simon once said I am a rock I am an i-i-i-island.
35434,Sheldon,What qualifies you to attempt to understand my mind?
35435,Penny,You know if it makes you feel any better…
35436,Penny,What?
35438,Leonard,Good night.
35439,Penny,No it was funny. Everyone laughed.
35440,Howard,I have three words for you. Wrath of Khan.
35441,Penny,Hey I think I know how you did the card trick.
35442,Penny,Yeah that’s what I’m counting on. Spill.
35443,Sheldon,No no. We designed an experiment involving you. See? Now isn’t that interesting?
35444,Raj,He got us again.
35445,Leonard,Hold on. How did you get him in the car?
35446,Penny,Dr. Lorvis what are you doing here?
35447,Leonard,On the other hand I think Sheldon might be the larval form of his species and someday he’ll spin a cocoon and emerge two months later with moth wings and an exoskeleton.
35448,Penny,Well it’s a bar so pretty good. Uh what’s new?
35449,Sheldon,That didn’t happen.
35450,Penny,Oh. Hey what smells so good?
35451,Raj,What about you Sheldon? Do you have any plans tonight?
35453,Howard,Foamy vengeance.
35454,Raj,Okay okay that-that came out wrong but you have to admit you all had a wonderful time.
35455,Sheldon,Oh Research Lab is more than a game. It’s like the slogan says the physics is theoretical but the fun is real.
35456,Penny,Okay hold on…
35457,Leonard,I’m just saying sometimes Raj and I feel pushed aside.
35458,Leonard,Well okay with the Indian food the pizza the Thai food the tank of gas the frozen yogurt and your rent uh a little over fourteen hundred dollars.
35459,Sheldon,I told you before bears are terrifying.
35460,Leonard,You can’t replace me with Zack.
35461,Howard,Okay. Okay thank you. Oh if she’s scared you can sing to her. She likes Katy Perry. Oh but don’t do Firework that gets her all riled up.
35462,Raj,You would do that for me?
35463,Leonard,It changed.
35465,Sheldon,If we’re going to change the topic from jellyfish I’d be okay with brine shrimp or the history of the unicycle.
35466,Sheldon,Isn’t it five thirty in the morning there?
35467,Leonard,Because I know exactly the kind of guy you would’ve ended up with.
35468,Leonard,No. No no that that would be underreacting. He did break the implied confidentiality of the bedroom and in your case the elevator parks and fast food franchise.
35469,Penny,Well I’d ask you guys if you want dessert but I know Sheldon doesn’t eat dessert on Tuesdays. And even if Raj wanted something he couldn’t tell me. Howard won’t order anything but he will come up with some sort of skeevy comment involving the words pie or cheesecake. And Leonard’s lactose intolerant so he can’t eat anything here without his intestines blowing up like a balloon animal.
35470,Raj,Hey you busy?
35471,Penny,I do it’s just he wants to go to that party at the comic book store. A lot of the guys that hang out there are kind of creepy.
35472,Penny,Okay that that’s great. You can stop trying to make me feel better now.
35473,Sheldon,Please.
35474,Penny,Okay. Ready set go.
35475,Sheldon,You know you just split an infinitive.
35476,Leonard,There’s no fooling you. Now what is this sacks statistic they put up there?
35477,Penny,Okay.
35478,Penny,Okay um gosh how do I start? Um see Raj is kind of naive. I mean he hasn’t dated a whole lot of women. And I’m concerned that without meaning to you might be taking advantage of him. You know by letting him buy you a bunch of expensive things.And I.. I… Howard focus. Tell her what I’m saying.
35479,Howard,Hello again.
35480,Sheldon,I tried once. They do men’s and women’s hair in the same room at the same time. It’s like Sodom and Gomorrah with mousse.
35481,Sheldon,Full of eggs and only appealing for a short time.
35482,Raj,I will.
35483,Leonard,I think we have to acknowledge those were some fairly savage pre-adolescent Jews.
35484,Penny,Look normally I can just ignore you. I mean I get it you’re a little peculiar. You know like Sheldon.
35485,Sheldon,Thank you. I appreciate that. You’re good people Leonard. There’s something I need to tell you.
35486,Sheldon,Well to paraphrase Mozart all the subatomic particles are there I just have to put them in the right order.
35487,Penny,No it’s okay between 
35488,Penny,Oh there’s so much I want to change.
35489,Raj,I also love the enemies of America.
35490,Penny,Okay this is not what I meant when I said go outside and play.
35491,Penny,Oh sure.
35492,Sheldon,Howard?
35493,Penny,Oh my God. Sheldon?
35494,Leonard,I’m sorry duh what?
35495,Penny,Sheldon. I’m just going to sit down.
35496,Sheldon,It’s a terrific book. I’ve distilled its essence into a simple flowchart that would guide me through the process.
35497,Sheldon,But we start talking about a table and suddenly we’re at each other’s throats.
35498,Leonard,Oh I actually did hear your eyes roll that time.
35499,Raj,You should go to my girl. She’ll knock out those sideburns for free.
35500,Sheldon,How can one person be a whole movie?
35501,Penny,Goodnight Leonard.
35502,Leonard,Dad you remember Sheldon.
35503,Leonard,Oh no. Good game.
35504,Penny,Ooh Thor! He’s hot.
35505,Sheldon,I have to. How can we ever hope to have a healthy relationship if I don’t tell her how disappointed I am and that I’ll never forgive her?
35506,Penny,I think I know.
35507,Howard,There’s a new sports bar over on Colorado Ave…
35508,Raj,Is there anything you’re both equally bad at?
35509,Raj,I’ll make the popcorn.
35510,Penny,Yeah you do that.
35511,Sheldon,No. I do not accept this. Everything is changing and I hate it. It stops now. I’m helping you get back on your feet. I would like to purchase this comic book please.
35512,Sheldon,Dear Lord you’re an astronomer. Although you may have earthly woes get your mind back on the stars. Gee even the lowly dung beetle chooses to plot its course by using the Milky Way.
35513,Howard,Uh yeah can you uh reach that uh gravy boat up there?
35514,Sheldon,Very well. I’m on board.
35515,Raj,Did Bernadette think it was cool?
35516,Penny,Great because I’ve been thinking if I really want this acting thing to work I need to focus all my energy on it. And to do that I should quit waitressing at The Cheesecake Factory.
35517,Penny,Hey let’s light a fire.
35518,Leonard,Come on come home with us and tomorrow I’ll I’ll take you to Legoland.
35519,Sheldon,Well now did you also have a dog? Because I found what appears to be a battery-operated chew toy.
35520,Leonard,Well Mrs. Latham said she was seriously considering donating money so we could get a cryogenic centrifugal pump.
35521,Howard,Why would I lose friends just because I started dating someone?
35522,Sheldon,Well what do you know? Here I was waiting to be bored with biology and instead you tickle my intellectual fancy. Which unlike my body is an okay place to tickle.
35523,Penny,Yeah. So how you doing?
35524,Penny,Well what a thrill.
35525,Howard,I bought a parrot.
35526,Sheldon,Quick what does a hawk sound like?
35527,Sheldon,Excuse me. I didn’t authorize this.
35528,Howard,Painfully so. We have this rule on the phone that if no one talks for three minutes you can just hang up. So into her.
35529,Sheldon,Five what?
35530,Sheldon,No. I had a date with a proper education. Instead of a tuxedo I dressed myself in good habits. Instead of spiked punch I enjoyed the intoxicating flavour of knowledge. Instead of dancing in a gym I shook my bootyto the seductive rhythms…
35531,Penny,Here buy this one. Look it’s the one we’re getting see happy guy available.
35532,Sheldon,I object. You’re completely ignoring the law.
35533,Howard,Thank you Bernadette.
35534,Penny,I hear you broke up with Amy.
35535,Penny,Sheldon I’m sorry about your hamburger okay? I just don’t want to be a waitress for the rest of my life.
35536,Howard,Just because I didn’t express myself well doesn’t mean my underlying point was invalid! You bloviating buffoon!
35537,Sheldon,My apologies. Good night Amy.
35538,Sheldon,Yeah the correct animal for interspecies supersolider is koala. You would wind up with an army so cute it couldn’t be attacked.
35539,Raj,I’m having my windows untinted.
35540,Penny,Thank you.
35541,Leonard,Reconstituted Thai food.
35542,Howard,So um what surprised you the most when you first came to America?
35543,Penny,Pretty cool huh? Probably would cost like two hundred bucks in a store.
35544,Penny,Keep walking.
35545,Penny,Yeah I wonder what they’re gonna do when her apartment’s ready.
35546,Penny,So um Amy Sheldon tells me you’re a neuro something-or-other.
35547,Leonard,Building on that I’d like to remind you I’m lactose intolerant.
35548,Howard,Okay cool. Oh and you’re sure your roommate’s not gonna come back while I’m here alone right? ‘Cause that’ll be awkward.
35549,Howard,No. I I have no idea. What would you do?
35550,Leonard,Maybe you should consider women who aren’t in serious relationships with your closest friends?
35552,Raj,Yes?
35553,Sheldon,Every time?
35554,Penny,This is getting old fast Dolores knock it off.
35555,Raj,Thanks for the lift.
35556,Howard,I’m trying but you have to admit this is pretty damn funny.
35557,Penny,Wow. I cannot believe we are alone in our own apartment.
35558,Howard,Race riots?
35559,Penny,Oh are you sure? We’re celebrating our new ADD drug and it’ll probably be over in like six minutes.
35560,Howard,It is. I feel alive.
35561,Penny,Sheldon what about you? Did you have a Christmas tree?
35562,Penny,You didn’t get your part cut.
35563,Sheldon,Wrong they’ll be arranged seasonally.
35564,Leonard,Uh it is but I think you might’ve waited too long for it to be funny.  I was wrong it’s still funny.
35565,Leonard,I am not opening that door Sheldon.
35566,Leonard,Great what do you want to do?
35567,Penny,Oh. Zack hi. You guys remember Zack.
35568,Howard,Okay. Shall we? Oh my God. It’s light it’s flaky it’s buttery. You don’t need to have sex with him just eat one of these.
35569,Leonard,I love it.
35570,Sheldon,They gave one to that baby. He wasn’t even awake.
35571,Sheldon,I need it for my Robin collection.
35572,Sheldon,All right if you’re not going to remove it I’ll remove it for you.
35573,Raj,Forty-five.
35574,Howard,If you don’t want to look foolish doing something you should practice. Do you know how many Beef Wellingtons I made by myself before I invited you guys over? I’ll give you a hint. You can see them here here and here.
35575,Sheldon,All right. Let’s play Physics Fiesta.
35576,Sheldon,What are you implying?
35577,Leonard,Oh it was kind of like a birthday party. I got to see all my cousins and there was cake so…7
35578,Leonard,Look it’s you.
35579,Penny,Well then who did?
35580,Sheldon,That woman in there’s not going to have sex with you.
35581,Sheldon,It is also indigenous to Brazil as is the Cocoa Bean from which we get chocolate the best pudding. And you promised you wouldn’t do that anymore!
35582,Sheldon,I realized something. When Amy was in my life I was hyper-focused on my work and ignored her.
35583,Penny,Are you sure?
35584,Sheldon,I guess the experiment begins.
35585,Raj,Why me of all people?
35586,Leonard,What are you talking about it’s fine she bought it it’s over.
35587,Leonard,Waugh romance ninja.
35588,Penny,Okay so I pick good guys but turn them into losers.
35589,Raj,We’ll switch. You’ll come sit with me after intermission.
35590,Leonard,They zip him up in that bag.
35591,Penny,Okay Amy just told you some exciting news and you acted like it was no big deal.
35592,Sheldon,I’m listening to you snore. I’m wondering how I’ll ever sleep without it.
35593,Sheldon,I got the blues. My baby done left me.
35594,Sheldon,And Raj.
35595,Penny,Hello.
35596,Howard,We finally have proof that aliens walk among us.
35597,Sheldon,But how am I going to get to work?
35598,Leonard,Doesn’t sound very romantic.
35599,Penny,Okay.
35600,Leonard,Why does she get that? We never got that.
35601,Howard,Oh gets better.
35602,Sheldon,You’re living here provisionally. But I must say it’s looking good.
35603,Leonard,Yeah I’ve read about that they’re sending research teams down into abandoned salt mines.
35604,Penny,I guess I just miss when life was simpler.
35605,Raj,I don’t know. Um nuclear war. Accidentally being buried alive. Any of those movies where you get that phone call that says you’re going to die and then you do.
35606,Penny,Yeah?
35608,Raj,Nothing to worry about. People meet people all the time and it isn’t weird. I met Bon Jovi once which you’d think might be weird. Turns out total sweetheart.
35609,Howard,So my visa’s only good as long as I’m employed at the university and when they find out I’ve got squat they’re going to cut me off. By the way when I say squat I mean diddly-squat. I wish I had squat.
35610,Sheldon,I have to be honest with you Leonard I’m truly worried.
35611,Sheldon,I am. Yeah Penny pointed out that what I’m going through is essentially a breakup. And according to Cosmopolitan magazine one of the most effective techniques for moving on is to get rid of all reminders of the relationship.
35612,Leonard,Can you say that and not make it sound like I’m a cat who learned how to use the toilet?
35613,Penny,This is awesome. I love it!
35614,Sheldon,Did Leonard tell you to say that?
35615,Sheldon,And I am sure it’s still more valuable than whatever’s in here.
35616,Penny,Look Leonard you have to know how much I care about you. It’s just that I’ve said the L word too soon before and it didn’t work out very well.
35617,Sheldon,As usual you’re all wrong. The bravest person in the Marvel Universe is the doctor who gives Wolverine his prostate exam.
35618,Sheldon,Oh for heaven’s sake. I did your laundry I pee-pee-proofed your belt buckles I I even sprained my wrist helping your mother lift her bosom.
35619,Penny,Pretty good right?
35620,Howard,Yeah it depends on the privacy settings.
35621,Raj,Why didn’t you say anything?
35622,Sheldon,Well I assume she meant that the two of you together would constitute a couple that others might consider cute. An alternate and somewhat less likely interpretation is that you could manufacture one. As in oh look Leonard and Lesley made Mr and Mrs Goldfarb aren’t they adorable.
35623,Leonard,Because I can never understand your side.
35624,Leonard,So how is she?
35625,Raj,Well that was a waste of time. I’m such an idiot.
35626,Sheldon,Oh I’m outraged.
35627,Leonard,No.
35628,Penny,Well why don’t you make up your own ending?
35629,Sheldon,I do tonight. It’s scary over there.
35630,Leonard,Onion dip it’s onion dip.
35631,Sheldon,Aquaman? Oh this isn’t a gag gift Stuart.
35632,Sheldon,No! Would you please stop referencing that infernal book? For example this morning I was calculating the random motion of virtual particles in a vacuum when suddenly the particles morphed into an image of Amy’s dandruff gently cascading down onto her pale slightly hunched shoulders. Oh what has that vixen done to me Leonard? And how do I make it stop?
35633,Leonard,Hmm. Kind of a strange place to put a picture of you and Bernadette.
35634,Penny,You don’t wanna wash that.
35635,Howard,I’d love a personal trainer. I haven’t seen my abs since they opened a Shake Shack on my drive home.
35636,Raj,Aw you brought cookies for everyone?
35637,Penny,Yeah I’m sorry about that.
35639,Sheldon,With the understanding that nothing changes whatsoever physical or otherwise I would not object to us no longer characterizing you as not my girlfriend.
35640,Sheldon,But if my mom asks we have bunk beds.
35641,Leonard,No tell me.
35642,Sheldon,Look at him. Wil Wheaton my old friend I have chased you round the moons of Nibia and round the Antares maelstrom and round perdition’s flames!
35644,Howard,Go for stereo.
35645,Sheldon,The photo of the cat who wants to “has cheezburger”?
35646,Leonard,Damn. I burped so hard i died in my game.
35647,Leonard,Oh. I used to be like that. Then I got a girlfriend.
35648,Sheldon,My name is right on there with yours. That is a surefire mark of quality. That might as well say directed by Joss Whedon.
35649,Howard,Oh Howard I’ve got a party to plan. Don’t make me pull it out of you.
35650,Raj,I’m spoiled? Your baby has a cape that costs $300.
35651,Penny,Come on. Looks don’t matter to Sheldon. Because he only has eyes for you.
35652,Leonard,The interface is pretty simple. You put your horizontal X coordinate here vertical Y coordinate here. When you’re happy with those you press this button.
35653,Sheldon,Oh I don’t think I could do that.
35654,Leonard,Please tell me how I can fix it.
35655,Raj,Perhaps this will help. Here are some facts about yourselves in the future that might contain a clue.
35656,Leonard,Oh relax. She took Sheldon to the hospital to get a brain scan.
35657,Sheldon,Thank you.
35658,Leonard,Can I see?
35659,Leonard,Excuse me Sheldon how many reels before the subordinate male protagonist gets to his point?
35660,Sheldon,Okay I see what’s happening.
35661,Penny,Doug? Oh yeah I dunno I mean he’s nice and funny but…
35662,Penny,Oh hey.
35663,Howard,Howard built a sex robot.
35664,Leonard,What? Why?
35665,Sheldon,And don’t be chintzy with the Shirley.
35666,Sheldon,All right. It’s a warm summer evening in ancient Greece…
35667,Leonard,All right we gave it 45 minutes. It’s no longer funny. Let’s try something else.
35668,Sheldon,The mrow that sounded to me like an African civet cat.
35669,Sheldon,Of course there’s there’s always your apartment.
35670,Howard,But Papa please….
35671,Leonard,Mm-hmm.
35672,Leonard,Wow that’s amazing. I’m in a pretty great mood today myself.
35673,Raj,Great. I bought her a couple of drinks and she gave me her e-mail address.
35674,Penny,Well I do.
35675,Sheldon,Your friends? Well I think you mean my friends. And why wasn’t I invited to this?
35676,Raj,No. Oh is he anything like uh Mun-Mun the Mongoose? He taught us not to play with cobras.
35677,Sheldon,Hang on.
35678,Sheldon,Oh.
35679,Howard,Ooh I’ll uh text Stuart let him know we’re close.
35680,Penny,What’s wrong?
35681,Sheldon,When they were over here did you fail to offer them a beverage? ‘Cause I can see how that could stick in someone’s craw.
35682,Raj,They also don’t care for it if you stare at them and hyperventilate. Sadly that’s my home run swing.
35683,Sheldon,Howard I have to go to the bathroom and no one will take me home.
35684,Howard,Oh I am I am. I I guess I’m still wondering if Emily and I are right for each other.
35685,Howard,Only if you’re this jellyfish which periodically reverts to a mass of undifferentiated protoplasm.
35686,Howard,Getting kind of grim.
35687,Sheldon,When I lie through my teeth to a woman you nod and agree.
35688,Penny,What is it?
35689,Howard,You can make him do anything you want.
35690,Leonard,Keep M&M’S in your pocket in case you have to wait in a long line.
35691,Sheldon,I’ve got a treat for us tomorrow Mom. I’m taking you to see Saul Perlmutter give a lecture about his Nobel Prize-winning work in cosmology. And the best part is at the Q and A afterward I’ve worked up a couple of Q’s that will stump his sorry A.
35692,Sheldon,He did.
35693,Raj,So what should we do today?
35694,Leonard,He’s not with a… does it really matter who or what he’s with? The guy is devastated.
35695,Sheldon,The statement stands for itself.
35696,Penny,No you do not.
35697,Raj,Oh that is completely below the belt. Sheldon tell my parents that Howard and I are just friends. Sheldon? Howard and I are just friends! Fine. I’ll come home for Sanjay’s wedding.
35698,Penny,I park fine.
35699,Howard,Uh Lucy has some uh social anxiety issues. Maybe we could start with something simpler.
35700,Howard,Gotcha. I’ll have a Brandy Alexander.
35701,Sheldon,That’s so thoughtful. You guys are the best.
35702,Leonard,That covers anything from farting in bed to killing a homeless guy. Oh my God. You ran over a hobo.
35703,Raj,Right. Good catch. Anyway so I’m sorry to waste your time. And uh and good luck with your screenplay.
35704,Raj,Me too.
35705,Howard,So I have an idea for a filk song. It’s kind of a a power ballad superhero crossover tale of epic proportions.
35706,Leonard,This is fun huh? We get to see our friend throw out the first pitch have a hot dog watch the game.
35707,Sheldon,The first forty-three parallel universes I’ve checked proved to be empty. I see no reason to suspect universe number forty-four will be any different. 
35708,Raj,Cool buddy! That’s awesome!
35709,Leonard,You really didn’t think I’d notice my stuff was missing?
35710,Penny,Okay so you’re saying I should go out with Leonard.
35711,Leonard,That was a huge spoiler.
35712,Leonard,I’m not that white. My great-great grandmother was half Cherokee. I know that’s not the right kind of Indian but it is something.
35713,Leonard,Yes.
35714,Sheldon,What if evil strikes and my power ring runs low?
35715,Leonard,Just tell her.
35716,Raj,You’re right. I… I am talking to you. Hello Penny how are you?
35717,Penny,All right. Let’s get this thing over with.
35718,Penny,So hi. What’s up?
35719,Raj,Yeah you can pick your wardrobe. You can even choose your accessories.
35720,Leonard,No.
35721,Penny,I’m sorry?
35722,Leonard,When would you have accidentally eaten chrysanthemum blossoms?
35723,Penny,Why you did sir. You. Dr. Sheldon Cooper and may I add it is a privilege to know you.
35724,Leonard,Where’s Howard?
35725,Penny,And helping people.
35726,Howard,Ooh this is exciting. Like one of my classic murder mystery dinner parties.
35727,Sheldon,Not to me. The only other retraction I ever had to issue was when I was seven and I conceded that my brother was the greatest ninja in East Texas. But that was just a ploy to get my face out of his armpit.
35728,Penny,Mm-hmm.
35729,Raj,I do like that the ex-boyfriend’s out of the picture.
35730,Sheldon,I knew it.
35731,Sheldon,I’m getting three trains.
35732,Raj,She is. She’s just running a little late. You know how it is girls always fussing about their hair their makeup. She’ll be here. Just give it a rest okay?
35733,Penny,Uh it’s okay I’m still in pharmaceutical sales.
35734,Leonard,Come on please.
35735,Raj,Nobody can.
35736,Raj,Howard there must be someone at the university you can go to for help.
35737,Sheldon,Fire away.
35738,Sheldon,Soft kitty warm kitty little ball of fur. Happy kitty sleepy kitty purr purr purr.
35739,Sheldon,Congratulations. The bearer of this certificate is entitled to the ultimate train experience at The Nevada Northern Railway. You are at the throttle. You are the engineer. You are running the locomotive. This doesn’t happen very often but here comes a hug. Oh dear I have to tinkle again.
35740,Sheldon,Of course not.
35741,Raj,Oh man that is so us.
35742,Howard,Hey. Listen to this. Murder cannibalism and satanic rituals are just a few of the thousand plus horrors that await.
35743,Sheldon, Penny.
35744,Sheldon,Oh stop it. I assume this medical centre’s already treated the burns on your bottom from the recent pants fire.
35745,Leonard,Bernadette that’s great. Howard do you make a buttload?
35746,Sheldon,Howard Raj. Judas.
35747,Sheldon,No. No after everything you didn’t do for me tonight I want you to have it.
35748,Sheldon,Under normal circumstances I’d say I told you so. But as I have told you so with such vehemence and frequency already the phrase has lost all meaning. Therefore I will be replacing it with the phrase I informed you thusly.
35749,Penny,That is the worst isn’t it?
35750,Penny,Oh you’re right. That is so embarrassing.
35751,Penny,Well Mom I’m sorry but…
35752,Sheldon,Damn you walletnook.com.
35753,Leonard,Exactly. Thank you. Do me a favour tell Koothrappali that next time you see him.
35754,Sheldon,What’s the protocol for leaving?
35755,Howard,Still making sure the telescope’s camera is white-field balanced.
35756,Penny,Oh what the hell. Ooh!
35757,Leonard,Until you have kids.
35758,Leonard,No no it’s not like that. It’s uh I don’t know what it’s like. But there is something I should prepare you for.
35759,Penny,Okay sweetie we’re on the clock here. Can you hate yourself and frost at the same time?
35760,Leonard,The the element never existed. I didn’t take it away science took it away. Be mad at science.
35761,Sheldon,Well you sit back relax and enjoy a beloved childhood memory. You see that cabin there? I read they were illegally squatting on Indian land. Yeah. Personally I think what we did to the Native Americans was wrong but this is your favourite show not mine. Oh look at little Laura Ingalls eating that peanut butter sandwich. Peanut butter? Huh? That’s strange since peanut butter wasn’t introduced until the early 1900s. If I knew this show was about time travel I would have watched it much sooner.
35763,Raj,Then don’t do it.
35764,Penny,Okay well I’d offer you Halloween candy but that’s gone. So what’s up?
35765,Penny,Are you Stan Lee?
35766,Penny,Okay I know you don’t have a lot of experience with women but Ramona seems to have a romantic interest in you.
35767,Penny,Okay let’s go.
35768,Leonard,Me too.
35769,Sheldon,I couldn’t sleep because I kept thinking about what happened earlier between us. Also I had one heck of a bus nap. Oh speaking of which do you want some mutton and coconut milk?
35771,Raj,The bigger question is what are you gonna eat with that spoon? You didn’t get any food.
35772,Penny,I wouldn’t be so sure about that.
35773,Sheldon,Okay.
35774,Sheldon,You know I don’t drink.
35775,Leonard,Sheldon you’re a grown man he’s a professional and your haircut is number three on that poster from 1946. Just sit down and let him do it.
35776,Leonard,He just gave it to you?
35777,Leonard,Here we go.
35778,Penny,Tell you what next French Toast Day I will make you oatmeal.
35779,Sheldon,Bleeding from my ears.
35780,Sheldon,Hurry hurry hurry.
35781,Leonard,Thank you. And now I owe you one.
35782,Penny,Thank you. So do you.
35783,Raj,Oh you don’t want that.
35784,Leonard,We’re not living together.
35786,Leonard,Okay listen I may not have been entirely faithful but you you are not easy to lift.
35787,Howard,Let’s just play.
35788,Raj,I appreciate the offer but if things don’t work out with you two I’m swooping in on her like a vulture.
35789,Sheldon,Figure out the magic trick yet?
35790,Sheldon,No of course not. That would be odd and suspicious behavior.
35791,Penny,And you’re afraid you’re gonna do something like your dad did?
35792,Penny,Daddy he had nothing to do…
35793,Penny,Because I know she hit on you and I know you liked it.
35794,Leonard,Yeah that’s a real pickle. Bye.
35795,Leonard,Fine. Preliminary trial of the infinite persistence gyroscopic navigational system phase one commencing.
35797,Raj,Okay well that’s a problem.
35798,Sheldon,Now get out of my spot.
35799,Raj,You could power down.
35800,Penny,The what?
35801,Howard,You could try calling Triple-A but based on NASA’s latest timetable they won’t get there for 35 years.
35802,Raj,The living room appears to be empty.
35803,Raj,Sheldon it’s your play. Sheldon.
35804,Leonard,So business in the front science in the back.
35805,Sheldon,Interesting.
35807,Sheldon,Oh as small as Leonard is I don’t think the two of you’d be comfortable on the couch.
35808,Leonard,Uh do you uh want to do that again?
35809,Leonard,I know but you guys make being a crappy friend look fun.
35810,Howard,I made a play for her and she shot me down.
35811,Leonard,Wait isn’t she the grad student that used to follow him around?
35812,Sheldon,More?
35813,Leonard,Oh right. That.
35814,Howard,Oh Howard it’s still our thing. Come with us we’ll we’ll get you a scalped ticket.
35815,Penny,Oh it’s no problem. Is everything okay?
35816,Sheldon,Sorry badgering me won’t work. What you should have said is It’s pointless to keep this a secret because Penny will tell us.
35818,Sheldon,Okay now the PS4 is more angular and sleek-looking.
35819,Penny,Where are my clothes?
35820,Penny,Yeah it’s just things are good right now.
35821,Penny,Unlikely. Here what about this one for my nephew?
35822,Penny,I cannot believe they’re letting her just use them like that. I mean anything she wants they go panting after her like trained dogs. You know that just last week she had Howard drive all the way to her uncle’s house in Orange County to pick up her TV?
35823,Raj,Yeah well I wouldn’t get too close. If I give the right command in German she’ll rip your face off.
35824,Leonard,Howard listen…
35825,Leonard,Let me guess you think the whole idea is lame?
35826,Howard,Hello?
35827,Raj,That’s fine. She and I can cry together.
35828,Leonard,Come on you enjoyed the movie. I saw you tearing up when the village got flooded and everyone had to relocate.
35829,Howard,Emily listen I’m sorry but I can’t come by.
35830,Raj,When can I sit with you again?
35831,Raj,Okay that’s my life that’s my friends good to see you say goodbye.
35832,Sheldon,Excuse me Leonard.
35834,Leonard,They…. might all be there. Or a subset of them might be there uh algebraically speaking there are too many unknowns for example Sheldon had Quizznos for lunch sometimes he finds that filling other times he doesn’t it’s no fault of Quizznos they have a varied menu.
35835,Penny,It’ll give you confidence. You know sometimes when I’m feeling all stressed out about something I go out and buy a cute top or a fun skirt and I have a whole new outlook on life.
35836,Penny,Kite fighting?
35837,Sheldon,It runs on syphilis?
35838,Leonard,Since my preschool got a bunny.
35839,Leonard,Sheldon.
35840,Penny,How can reading my journal be an accident?
35841,Penny,Anyways I wanted you guys all to know that I’ve been taking a really hard look at things and come to the conclusion I have to stop kidding myself. I suck at acting. It’s time for me to move back to Nebraska.
35842,Penny,Yes he is. With his dorky T-shirt and his little hipster glasses.
35843,Penny,Buy him the robot Leonard.
35844,Penny,Well that’s easy. Anyone can go online and get ordained as a minister. I know a piercing parlour where for a hundred bucks they’ll marry you and stick a wedding ring through any body part you want.
35845,Raj,All right.
35846,Leonard,No it’s not…
35847,Howard,And I thought me having sex with Emily was gonna be the big news.
35848,Sheldon,Okay thanks for your time.
35849,Penny,Definitely.
35850,Leonard,What the hell agreed.
35851,Sheldon,Sim City. More specifically the Sim City I designed Sheldonopolis.
35852,Penny,It is isn’t it?
35853,Sheldon,You’re sick? You poor kid. Well see ya.
35854,Leonard,Sheldon be nice.
35855,Sheldon,She’s like my fourth favourite catwoman.
35856,Leonard,What are you doing?
35857,Sheldon,Based on this pep talk I’d say you’re still doing it.
35858,Howard,Well that doesn’t seem fair.
35859,Howard,Thank you. I appreciate that.
35860,Sheldon,I’m confused. I thought you were involved in some sort of socially intimate pairing with Leslie Winkle.
35861,Leonard,Are you sure?
35862,Sheldon,Alright. But I’m watching you.
35863,Leonard,I know it’s high-resolution sadness.
35864,Penny,Oh I’ll get that.
35865,Leonard,What’s Gunning with God? I’m afraid to ask.
35866,Sheldon,I’d like your honest opinion on something.
35867,Leonard,Hippos are the deadliest creature. A half-human half-hippo soldier would be pretty badass.
35868,Raj,Over what?
35869,Leonard,Perfect timing. Food’s ready.
35870,Howard,We just got back from that exhibit of those plasticised human cadavers.
35871,Sheldon,Thanks.
35872,Leonard,I don’t know how I feel about this.
35873,Sheldon,What?
35874,Sheldon,I feel like I’m being strangled by a boa constrictor. Why’d you stop?
35875,Penny,Absolutely not. Look we’re just gonna have dinner and you know see how it goes.
35876,Sheldon,Howard if I may interject here with a piece of friendly advice. Is working on magic tricks really how you want to spend your time? Granted you’re just an engineer but that doesn’t mean you might not someday build a geegaw or a thingamabob that may get you a thank you in someone else’s Nobel prize acceptance speech.
35877,Penny,Fine. What do you want?
35878,Leonard,It’s not just Cylons. Superman’s next.
35879,Sheldon,I know. And it gets worse. Her efforts are causing me to have affectionate feelings for her at inappropriate times.
35880,Sheldon,No we’re not. Let’s say for a moment that I accept the bath item gift hypothesis I now lay the following conundrum at your feet which size?
35881,Howard,Are you single?
35882,Sheldon,I’m not going to apologise I didn’t say anything that wasn’t true.
35883,Raj,Yeah I saw something for Halley and I couldn’t resist.
35884,Leonard,He chased a squirrel around the quad for a while and then threw up in my car.
35885,Leonard,I do.
35886,Leonard,Wow it’s all happening so fast. Should we just sleep on it?
35887,Sheldon,Then I’ve been up all night.
35888,Sheldon,I agree. I move our relationship terminate immediately.
35889,Howard,Forty-five.
35890,Leonard,It is an inefficient design for example Penny has a flat screen TV which means all the space behind it is wasted.
35891,Leonard,It’s not that simple. What am I supposed to say? Penny do you have any friends you’d like to never hear from again?
35892,Penny,Wow Zork. Well you guys have fun.
35893,Sheldon,Penny. Didn’t you recently state that you and I are friends?
35894,Sheldon,Not knowing is part of the fun. Was that the motto of your community college?
35895,Sheldon,There you go one enchanted sword.
35896,Howard,Oh not really just hang out.
35897,Penny,Hi. What’s up?
35898,Raj,I don’t care! And why don’t you think I can find a woman for myself?
35899,Sheldon,Okay but just don’t fight
35900,Raj,I’d like to propose a toast to a rare and wonderful Sheldon-free evening.
35901,Leonard,Oh hey buddy. How’d it go?
35902,Sheldon,Does it? A happy accident.
35903,Leonard,My father used to borrow it.
35904,Leonard,Yeah but there was ample parking.
35905,Leonard,Then he and I are on equal ground.
35906,Penny,So um what are you gonna do? Do you want me to talk to Leonard let him down easy?
35907,Raj,My sister told me.
35908,Sheldon,Gentlemen a little less bellyaching. We’re Starfleet officers and a member of the Borg Collective.
35909,Penny,Yes it’s very nice goodnight Raj.
35911,Sheldon,Hmm yes. Yeah perhaps I’ve been harder on them than they deserve.
35912,Howard,No I kind of feel like being alone right now.
35913,Penny,All right well what happens if you imagine him naked?
35914,Penny,Wow where did you learn these moves?
35915,Raj,I’m the astrophysicist. Astro means space.
35916,Howard,Oh hey Bernadette the swing comes with two different mobiles. The giraffes are pretty cute what do you think?
35917,Penny,Oh that is so sad.
35918,Sheldon,Why would you do that? You’re a string theorist as well.
35919,Penny,So sleep with the new girl and lie to Priya.
35920,Leonard,Excuse me?
35921,Sheldon,The dog… koira. The roof… katto. Grapes… ryp leet.  One minute. Sis  n.
35922,Sheldon,Yes but he can relapse if Penny ever invites us to go hear her sing again.
35923,Raj,No you have to put this back together right now so I can return it.
35924,Howard,Really? I once saw him shopping at Ralph’s. He was buying tequila.
35925,Penny,Sweetie put the pants on.
35926,Sheldon,That’s a good sign right?
35927,Leonard,Oh okay yeah hang on a sec. 
35928,Raj,Sure whatever.
35929,Leonard,Just let it go Sheldon.
35930,Penny,Well I’m glad you’re still together.
35931,Raj,It doesn’t have an oh in front of it.
35932,Raj,Mm-hmm.
35933,Howard,Is that racist? It feels racist.
35934,Leonard,Are you kidding? Yes. What did you have in mind?
35935,Penny,Is that the place on the hill with the weird priests in front of it?
35936,Sheldon,That’s preposterous.
35937,Leonard,Yeah why?
35938,Sheldon,It’s not. I’ll have you know in the field of physics we work with particles so small they make fat jokes about the locus coeruleus i.e. when your locus coeruleus sits around the house it sits around the house.
35939,Penny,Look Sheldon before you race off to the fertility clinic you might want to think about uh gee I don’t know maybe actually spending some time with her.
35940,Sheldon,Boy I’m glad we’re going out again.
35941,Penny,Aw.
35942,Penny,Okay listen to me. Playing games is not gonna help get Amy back.
35943,Leonard,What uh you and me? Yeah we did. Not too long ago. How are you doing with it?
35944,Raj,Uh do do you like being a mall security guard?
35945,Sheldon,It really doesn’t matter as long as it’s challenging.
35946,Leonard,We tried. She doesn’t get along with Sheldon.
35947,Leonard,We’re actually scanning equations and getting good results.
35948,Penny,Well who’d you go with?
35949,Penny,We’re doing good. I think Sheldon has something he would like to say to Amy.
35950,Sheldon,Well that really hurt.
35951,Sheldon,Hit it.
35952,Sheldon,My room of course.
35953,Sheldon,I couldn’t sleep.
35954,Sheldon,Well not just him. May I remind you that you’re talking to the seeker beater chaser and water boy of the third place Griffith Park Quidditch team.
35955,Penny,Please? I went to your boring thing last month.
35956,Leonard,That’ll be four seventy-five.
35957,Leonard,Really?
35958,Howard,Then how?
35959,Howard,I’m sorry.
35960,Leonard,What?
35961,Leonard,Bite me. Sheldon how could you just sit there and let them spy on me?
35962,Penny,No I was thinking how come they get to leave and I can’t.
35963,Sheldon,Amy after consideration I believe we may have acted rashly. I propose we resume our relationship and attempt to resolve our differences.
35964,Sheldon,Can’t listen zone. Also don’t care.
35965,Sheldon,Oh really? When I was doing string theory and hit a dead end why didn’t you try to help me?
35966,Penny,Since always.
35967,Leonard,Thanks sorry to bother you. But I said it like a badass.
35968,Leonard,The the gas station across the street.
35969,Sheldon,The Web site’s frozen. I can’t get in.
35971,Sheldon,Oh no not just a season. If I’m in I’m in for the whole run even if the quality declines.
35972,Howard,I’m sure you guys will figure something out.
35973,Leonard,Look. We keep procrastinating. We saw Back to the Future II pigeons playing ping-pong a bunch of countries that look like genitals and one guy whose genitals look like Denmark.
35974,Howard,Well the cleaning lady was there but she doesn’t like me. You need any help?
35975,Sheldon,You got it buddy.
35976,Sheldon,This is for you.
35977,Penny,Schnapps.
35978,Howard,Well it was fun. I used some of the jewellery techniques you taught us. It’s a lightsabre belt buckle.
35979,Penny,Okay so Kim the night manager went on maternity leave and her husband’s name is Sandy right? So get this her replacement is a woman named Sandy whose husband’s name is Kim.
35980,Raj,Are you here alone?
35981,Sheldon,I know it’s basic culinary science.
35982,Leonard,No a time machine from Sophie’s Choice.
35983,Raj,I don’t know I’m torn. I want to know where he’s going but now I kind of want to play with the bunny.
35984,Howard,I don’t know. Maybe Jughead’s a Terminator.
35985,Howard,This van was owned and driven by your personal physics hero Richard Feynman.
35986,Penny,Hmm. Well I’m glad you’re having such a great day.
35987,Penny,I have to go to the bathroom.
35988,Raj,Well I’m glad to see you moving forward.
35989,Leonard,I’m not leaving until you talk to me.
35990,Raj,Oh she’s meeting us here. Hey guys do me a favour and don’t ask too many questions about the relationship. We’re just keeping it casual.
35991,Penny,Oh guys this is really sad. And in a different way than it was twenty minutes ago.
35992,Sheldon,Fine I’ll take it back.
35993,Howard,I totally had one of those.
35994,Leonard,Raj what are you doing?
35995,Howard,Oh. Did you know at the United Nations there’s a Department for Outer Space Affairs?
35997,Sheldon,Not only is it signed to me but this is where he wiped his mouth. So we are currently in the presence of Leonard Nimoy’s DNA.
35998,Sheldon,I’m so proud of you! You sold yourself out like a common streetwalker!
35999,Leonard,Interesting.
36000,Raj,Oh my God what happened?
36001,Raj,Actually in this case I think she was.
36002,Raj,Fine just try not to look too alive.
36003,Sheldon,I said ta-da. Show’s over.
36004,Howard,Hey.
36005,Leonard,It must be hell inside your head.
36006,Raj,Aw there’s a thing.
36007,Penny,Uh-huh he called me Slugger until I got my first training bra and then he just stopped playing catch with me. I wasn’t Slugger anymore. Your mother’s here!
36008,Leonard,I’m not gonna schmooze anybody. I’m gonna let my work speak for itself.
36009,Penny,Oh come on it’s fine. We’ll just put it all on the table you know family style.
36010,Howard,Oh no.
36011,Howard,You dream different than me.
36012,Raj,You’re kidding.
36013,Penny,No. No no no. You know what? The toilet’s been doing that. I called the building manager so…
36014,Penny,Hi.
36015,Leonard,Oh what the hell. I’m supposed to go see that girl from the comic book store Alice but I don’t know if I should because I’m going out with Priya but she’s in India.
36016,Sheldon,I see. Is that all right? I’m sorry but this is a litigious society. I’m gonna need verbal consent.
36017,Leonard,Uh sure.
36018,Leonard,It’s Thursday. Listen Penny.
36019,Sheldon, Human Resources Department.
36020,Raj,Come on dude we’ve been friends for years.
36021,Penny,Hey can I stay here tonight?
36022,Sheldon,Science. You wouldn’t understand.
36023,Sheldon,Or fornication. Yeah. But that has judgmental overtones so I’ll hold that in reserve.
36024,Howard,Well anyway I’ll leave you to your girls’ night.
36025,Sheldon,Look on the bright side. As the result of Penny’s forfeit you have become the world’s first winner of Research Lab. Would you like a commemorative snow cone?
36026,Penny,Well it’s a table right? I mean why can’t there be food on it?
36027,Penny,Really? Well that’s great.
36028,Leonard,No we just had a little spat.
36029,Raj,I have no choice.
36030,Leonard,He’s right Penny. It’s all there.
36031,Raj,Okay. But you using Sheldon to do your dirty work is like when Cersei used the King’s Guard to do her bidding.
36032,Penny,We’re just gonna have to make the best of this.
36033,Howard,That’ll do it.
36035,Sheldon,That sounds like sarcasm but I’m going to disregard it because I have an agenda. Paintball. Specifically the interdepartmental tournament this weekend. Now in order to function better as a fighting unit I thought we should establish a chain of command. Now it goes without saying that I would outrank the three of you but the question remains by how much? Now I don’t see me as some four-star general back at HQ riding a desk and playing golf with the Secretary of Defence. But I also can’t be Sergeant Cooper because that might lead you to think of me as just a regular Joe. This might take some thought. As you were.
36036,Sheldon,Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.
36037,Howard,Just a sec. Oh who says just a sec? I hate myself. Hello.
36038,Sheldon,All I know is you can only fit one of her in a car. And there’s the clown that came out of her. I really didn’t want to come here but this is shaping up to be one of the best Thanksgivings I’ve had in a long time.
36039,Sheldon,There’s nothing to worry about. Your secret’s safe with me.
36040,Howard,And the other half licking my face. That’s why I’m brushing her teeth.
36041,Leonard,Oh that’s nice. But relax sometimes change is good. Uh you were worried about Zachary Quinto being the new Spock but you wound up liking him.
36042,Sheldon,Let me put this in a way you’ll understand Penny. You remember how you explained to me that the Kardashians aren’t real celebrities? Well geology is the Kardashians of science.
36043,Sheldon,Oh let me just get one thing. It’s my backup emergency supply kit. The living room escape route doesn’t pass through here. Now good night. And if there’s an apocalypse good luck.
36044,Penny,What are you doing?
36045,Sheldon,Nice. You mean like at parks and schools?
36046,Leonard,Sorry but I don’t think I need your permission to have my father at my wedding.
36047,Sheldon,I’m sorry Leonard. But revenge is a dish best served cold.
36048,Penny,Life? What life? Look at me I’m a monster. And now I have blood on my hands or paws. I don’t know.
36049,Raj,Well excuse me I don’t think Penny’s out of line at all. You don’t own her. It’s like my girl Beyonce says if you like it you shoulda put a ring on it.”
36050,Raj,That’s Howard’s cousin that he had sex with.
36051,Howard,Thank you.
36052,Leonard,Sheldon what are the words I can say right now to end this conversation and let me go back to sleep?
36053,Sheldon,And turn the bedroom floor into an amniotic Slip ‘n Slide.
36054,Leonard, You got to stop beating yourself up over this. I mean you made a mistake but it was a happy mistake.
36055,Penny,Thank you.
36056,Leonard,Is Ernest Goes to Jail the only prison movie you’ve seen?
36057,Sheldon,How did we get in the car?
36058,Sheldon,Chicken?
36059,Howard,Well it almost happened when you called my apple pie crust doughy but the truth is you were right and I was just angry at myself.
36060,Sheldon,Yes.
36062,Penny,Oh. It’s it’s not what it looks like.
36064,Howard,Okay as soon as she gets here so she knows I’m cool with it I’m going to make a joke about her being deaf. I was thinking hey did you hear the one about…? Oh no I bet you didn’t.
36065,Leonard,See? Miserable.
36066,Leonard,Don’t look up there’s cameras.
36067,Leonard,Guess who the university is sending to Switzerland to attend a conference and see the CERN supercollider on February 14?
36068,Sheldon,And actually it was three different men.
36069,Raj,Come on a medium-sized asteroid is still an interesting discovery.
36070,Raj,Is it me or was that Sheldon’s way of saying Vegas baby!
36071,Sheldon,Oh I’m I’m sorry. I assumed that you wanted candid truth-telling from your employees but I realize now you want the mindless nattering of complacent yes-men.
36072,Penny,Again?
36073,Sheldon,I do.
36074,Sheldon,I think the Reverend Hofstadter is making an ironic connection between your statement about love and your rejection of his proposal in the bedroom.
36075,Leonard,No you’re not let’s go.
36076,Raj,You’re wrong.
36077,Penny,Yeah yeah yeah. You go ahead. I’ll catch up with you.
36078,Raj,Oh I’m having the nicest time. You guys are like family to me. You know that right?
36079,Penny,Uh yeah it sounds fun but no thanks.  Have a good night!
36080,Leonard,Why don’t you just give me five minutes? I’ll Google how to do this. I’ll call you right back.
36081,Howard,What’s it thinking about now?
36082,Leonard,Well did you try wearing the shirt I said was inappropriate for work?
36083,Leonard,Unbelievable. Okay uh I don’t know what he told you but you can’t stay here.
36084,Penny,Hey Leonard if you’re not busy tomorrow I have to do a little reception after work.
36085,Raj,Oh that’s a big deal.
36086,Leonard,Well just don’t get anything Jurassic. He feels like that whole chunk of time has gone Hollywood. Hey uh you know he told a sad story about how his sister tricked him into thinking Batman was coming to his party.
36087,Leonard,Sure. If he wants to spend a couple of years doing her homework while she drinks herself into a stupor with non-fat White Russians while you’re the one holding her head out of the toilet while she’s puking and telling you she wishes more guys were like you and they she gets into Cornell because you wrote her essay for her and you drive up to visit her one weekend and she acts like she doesn’t even know you.
36088,Leonard,Oh I’ll get it. Go sports.
36089,Penny,Oh well I had a wonderful childhood.
36090,Penny,Ugh what?
36091,Leonard,Well I wouldn’t put it exactly that way.
36093,Sheldon,Excuse me but isn’t hosting guests an aspect of Menushya Yajna one of the five central religious duties or sacrifices of the Hindu householder?
36094,Sheldon,We did it! I said we.
36095,Raj,Sheldon they don’t have ice cream.
36096,Sheldon,And I appreciate the pretence.
36097,Leonard,How could you get lost? Your phone has GPS.
36098,Penny,Well what’s wrong with my apartment?
36099,Sheldon,I’m a rogue knight elf don’t you people read character descriptions? Wait wait wait somebody just clicked “buy it now.”
36100,Howard,Are you happy now?
36101,Raj,And you knew about this this whole time?
36102,Sheldon,You’re welcome. Now Introduction to Physics. What is physics? Physics comes from the ancient Greek word physika. It’s at this point that you’ll want to start taking notes. Physika means the science of natural things. And it is there in ancient Greece that our story begins.
36103,Howard,Well you’re all thinking it I’m the only one who hasn’t done anything worthwhile.
36104,Penny,Okay wait…
36105,Sheldon,Oh thank you Mother.
36106,Sheldon,What could I possibly have done to offend Mrs. Vartabedian?
36107,Penny,I’ve never been to a funeral before.
36108,Penny,Yes.
36109,Penny,What do you have….
36110,Sheldon,Of course.
36111,Penny,Okay. Hang on. Are you saying someday you and Amy might actually get physical?
36112,Howard,I don’t know. Have you ever seen a movie with Stuart before?
36113,Penny,Hmm.
36114,Howard,Okay well I’m just trying to help you.
36115,Penny,So if you don’t mind me asking do you think you might start dating again?
36116,Sheldon,No Leonard this is your last chance. One day a historian is going to come to you and say is it true you were friends with Dr. Sheldon Cooper? And you’re going to have to choke back a hot sob of regret and humiliation as you mumble I was but I chose to go to a party thrown by the one kid from Stand By Me that no one remembers.
36117,Sheldon,Oh dear Lord. Two years ago we didn’t even know each other and now I’m in your apartment after dark. How much faster can this thing go?
36118,Sheldon,Did you stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard.
36119,Raj,What is wrong with people? Why don’t they stop?
36120,Raj,Sure.
36121,Sheldon,Uh thank you. Oh Meemaw got a new set of teeth. Oh but then she found her old ones. Oh so now the new ones are just gonna be her church teeth.
36122,Penny,Is that a pregnancy thing?
36123,Raj,The best one I ever had!
36124,Penny,All right sweetie I’m not going to get involved in your relationship.
36125,Leonard,Yeah. Okay listen. If you’re imagining that it was sexy it wasn’t. We we were both drunk and she smelled like an ashtray. The boat was moving a lot so I chipped her tooth.
36126,Penny,TV star.
36127,Leonard,And also for breaking the head off the ice swan so I could hold it against my pulled groin.
36128,Howard,Okay um how about Crash”? Howard “Crash” Wolowitz.
36129,Sheldon,I really think we should examine the chain of causality here.
36130,Sheldon,Well I’ve been on a little trip myself recently. Not to Sin City but to Sincere City. Where instead of genital warts the only growth you’ll come back with is personal growth.
36131,Penny,Okay look you just caught me by surprise last night. I didn’t know what to say.
36132,Penny,Hey. So where are they?
36133,Penny,Oh Leonard you shouldn’t have. Oh boy! What is it?
36134,Leonard,Huh well I think there’s some really innovative stuff going on in dark matter.
36135,Sheldon,Cruel as that may be that is not in itself a credential.
36136,Howard,I can’t compete with that. Bye.
36137,Raj,Oh what did I do?
36138,Leonard,Oh yeah no worries.
36139,Leonard,A cap and gown? Why do I need a cap and gown?
36140,Sheldon,Little generic. Keep thinking. We’ll circle back. Wil Wheaton go.
36141,Raj,Cool. I’ll make the popcorn.
36143,Raj,Sheldon says impossible. Howard and I say not only possible but as a mode of transportation way cooler than a Batmobile.
36144,Penny,Oh my God that’s where I know you from.
36145,Leonard,– Priya can I come in?
36146,Penny,Your what?
36147,Leonard,Well not really.
36148,Penny,Fine. Oh hey can I ask you something?
36150,Raj,No it’s not. Howard tell them.
36151,Leonard,Look I’m just saying um Penny is one of our many neighbours you know and in our building neighbours come and go it’s very casual no dress code. In fact some mornings I’ll just mosey down to the third floor in my pyjamas and have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.
36152,Howard,Nice try. It only recognizes my voice.
36153,Leonard,Huh?
36154,Raj,But technically yes.
36155,Sheldon,You know frankly I’d prefer a sex tape.
36156,Sheldon,Can you guarantee that it won’t happen at any time during the night?
36157,Leonard,Sure I’m still figuring out the thermo-acoustic expander.
36158,Sheldon,Okay. I like it a little better when you stay but all right.
36159,Leonard,Glad we cleared that up.
36160,Penny,Yeah sure.
36161,Leonard,I can’t believe you’re married to that idiot.
36162,Raj,Why?
36163,Sheldon,Alicia’s non-musical childless and pro-rug. She’s still on probation of course but I like her.
36164,Penny,Nice hat.
36165,Leonard,That can’t be much fun for Amy. You know at work today he tried his first Red Bull.
36166,Penny,Just a sec.  Too much?
36167,Penny,Yeah there’s room in the bed by Sheldon’s feet.
36168,Penny,Of course it is.
36169,Howard,He’s right. But in my defence if we could survive that we could survive anything.
36170,Leonard,Our clothes our wallets phones.
36171,Penny,Hey Raj do you want to go with me tomorrow?
36172,Howard,Me too. Oh look we’ve got enough ketchup to cover every ounce of it.
36173,Sheldon,You’re right. That is more menial. Hello I’m Sheldon. I’ll be your server today. I don’t recommend the salmon. I saw it in the kitchen.
36174,Leonard,That’s alright my tail’s prehensile I’ll swat him off.
36175,Raj,Well type two diabetes runs in my family. The thought of losing a toe…
36176,Sheldon,That’s exactly what I told him.
36177,Penny,You changed every word.
36178,Sheldon,Okay. Talk.
36179,Raj,Nothing rhymes with orange. It’s probably lonely.
36180,Raj,Hey how about we stay the night and hit Legoland in the morning?
36181,Sheldon,Howard Hughes saved his urine in milk bottles.
36182,Sheldon,She’s right. I’m too hot.
36183,Raj,You saw her. She looks like Jim Carrey from Dumb and Dumber.
36184,Sheldon,That’s right. It’s called foreplay. And I could make the case that you two aren’t moving forward in your relationship.
36185,Leonard,We’re here to see Koothrappali not kill Batman.
36186,Raj,Amy good luck getting these guys excited about a dinner with a theme. I gave up when no one cared about my Tom Hanks-giving.
36187,Raj,Oh and did they have kids?
36188,Sheldon,Sorry. I’m a little distracted. I can’t seem to get in touch with Amy. I tried e-mail video chat tweeting her posting on her Facebook wall texting her nothing.
36189,Howard,Maybe slapped with a fine.
36190,Leonard,Jimmy I’m kind of curious why you wanted to see me.
36191,Leonard,I’ve been thinking about it and you might be right. But the good news is that I’m pretty sure I know why.
36192,Howard,Ew.
36193,Sheldon,Technically that would be coitus interruptus.
36194,Leonard,What?
36195,Sheldon,Oh good Stuart I thought I heard your voice. Do you have a moment?
36196,Leonard,Maybe you should find someone to help you get your finances under control.
36197,Sheldon,You know the pale blue of Luke Skywalker’s lightsaber before it was digitally remastered?
36199,Sheldon,Oh I’m back to trains. Woo-woo.
36200,Leonard,That is good news. Bye.
36201,Sheldon,Yes but tell me a dinosaur chicken salad sandwich wouldn’t hit the Mesozoic spot.
36202,Sheldon,Yes of course that’s why it’s tight.
36203,Leonard,Let me see. Yeah there. What number were you putting in?
36204,Sheldon,Boldly go Howard Wolowitz.
36205,Sheldon,Yeah I’ll miss you too.
36206,Howard,I did the research. Tony the Tiger Dig’em the Frog Cap’n Crunch Toucan Sam Count Chocula Trix the Rabbit Snap Crackle and Pop. Not one cereal mascot is a girl. It’s a total breakfast sausage fest.
36207,Sheldon,It’s a kindness Leonard. Otherwise you’re cruelly tempting them with a glimpse of a world that’s just beyond their soot-stained fingertips.
36208,Sheldon,I’d write that down but I can’t now can I?
36209,Sheldon,It’s over for me. I’m done with women. Like when I swore off Pop Rocks. They both hurt you on purpose.
36210,Sheldon,Isn’t it?
36211,Leonard,Then what was oh boy?
36213,Penny,Oh they’re all up there huh? Hmm typical.
36214,Sheldon,I’m sorry Leonard this is Toby Loobenfeld he’s a research assistant in the particle physics lab but he also minored in theatre at MIT.
36215,Sheldon,How many of those women did you think would become your perfect companion?
36216,Sheldon,From your vantage point it certainly must seem so.
36217,Leonard,There is a party isn’t there.
36218,Sheldon,Kind of? It does it perfectly.
36219,Sheldon,And it’s just the way you like it.
36220,Leonard,When did this happen?
36221,Sheldon,Leonard the Transformers teach us that things are not always what they appear to be. You know like uh a semi truck might be an alien robot or uh someone in a romantic relationship uh might feel differently than they appear to. Or a conversation about The Transformers might actually be about someone in this room. I’m going to pause to let that sink in.
36222,Sheldon,You say one thing and do the other so then you are driving me and you find me a delight.
36223,Leonard,No no. No it’s too late. I’m your bran muffin. Probably fat-free and good for your colon.
36224,Penny,You poor things you must be exhausted.
36225,Raj,You dream different than me.
36226,Howard,It’s nice to see you taking an interest in Amy’s work.
36227,Sheldon,The tragic history of slavery in America. Fun for the whole family.
36228,Sheldon,I don’t like being extorted like this. Especially by him of all people.
36229,Penny,No yeah she’s definitely a whore. I mean she has absolutely no standards this one time she was at… where’s Howard?
36230,Sheldon,Great so they own my idea for a T-shirt that says Dumb as a Bag of Geologists.
36231,Howard,Excuse me I think how could you she’s my sister takes precedence over a five year old pinky swear!
36232,Leonard,It would wouldn’t it?
36233,Sheldon,This is my girlfriend Amy. Amy this is television legend Arthur Jeffries. His science show inspired millions of children.
36234,Sheldon,In order to live long enough to fuse my consciousness with cybernetics I need to change my diet.
36235,Howard,It’s like some kind of weird comic book crossover.
36236,Leonard,Really?
36237,Howard,It’s nice that all the people who are lonely on Valentine’s Day can come here tonight and be together.
36238,Penny,I don’t know it just died I’m getting a bunch of static.
36239,Penny,It’s not Saturday night. Why are you doing your laundry?
36240,Sheldon,Honesty will never get us in.
36241,Leonard,Yeah it’ll help them get away when they see a g-g-ghost.
36242,Penny,Yeah it’s okay.
36244,Sheldon,An appropriate cricket name. For example Jiminy.
36245,Sheldon,Year after year I had to endure wearing conical hats while being forced into the crowded sweaty hell of bouncy castles not to mention being blindfolded and spun towards a grotesque tailless donkey as the other children mocked my disorientation.
36246,Penny,Wow so in your world you’re like the cool guys.
36247,Sheldon,By seeing the movie she’d want me to see?
36248,Sheldon,Yeah well maybe it is maybe it isn’t. I have been hallucinating lately.
36250,Raj,What about me?
36251,Raj,Yeah I think so. Do you have any advice?
36252,Sheldon,Be grateful I’m still in the room.
36253,Sheldon,Tapioca is extracted from the root of the plant Manihot Esculenta. Due to a high concentration of cyanide it is poisonous in its raw form and lethal if prepared improperly.
36254,Leonard,Yeah no I don’t think so.
36255,Penny,That’s from Say Anything.
36256,Leonard,Uh-huh.
36257,Raj,You know if we were in India this would be simpler. Five minutes with her dad twenty goats and a laptop and we’d be done.
36258,Raj,Very basic.
36259,Leonard,Don’t worry they’re more scared of you than you are of them.
36260,Penny,No I’m a terrible waitress remember?
36261,Sheldon,And not-a-doctor Howard Wolowitz.
36262,Leonard,What the hell are you doing?
36263,Penny,Oh thanks. This must be the beret I ordered. A couple of months ago. It was back-ordered.
36264,Leonard,Oh-hom yeah.
36265,Sheldon,Wow. Is that the kind of nagging I can expect now that you’re my girlfriend? Good thing I drew this up.
36266,Leonard,All right so it sounds like we need a way to communicate that’s simple.
36267,Leonard,You got alcohol?
36268,Sheldon,Well Leonard you know who should keep this? On the one hand I love Mr. Spock more than you do. On the other hand I care more about clocks than you do.
36269,Leonard,Let’s put it to a vote. All those in favour….
36270,Penny,Hey. So you guys ready to order?
36271,Sheldon,You know what? You think you’re so tolerant but the truth is you’re mean to me a lot. Yeah you think that I don’t notice all those sarcastic comments and those eye rolls but I do. Hmm? I have excellent peripheral vision. On a good day I can see my ears.
36272,Leonard,Absolutely. You’re the girl I’m the guy. Now you watch your football game while I make you a little plate here.
36273,Sheldon,If you were a cat I would have brought you a lasagna.
36274,Raj,This says you can make end of life decisions for me.
36275,Sheldon,Ah that’s just as well. As much as I’d love to meet Euclid inventor of the geometric proof he probably wore sandals and I cannot look at toes during dinner. Oh I know the person I’d most like to have dinner with is myself.
36276,Sheldon,Extra breading?
36277,Penny,The little choo-choo for toddlers?
36278,Sheldon,Forget science. She’s horny.
36279,Sheldon,Excuse me. Here look up fun get back to me.
36280,Penny,Sheldon’s not here. Why don’t you take the sweater off?
36281,Sheldon,Will you guys keep it down?
36282,Penny,It’s not getting any better.  Ugh. It’s Leonard. He wants to go costume shopping later.
36283,Leonard,Yeah but I already saw him naked. Just come here.
36284,Leonard,I’m not moody. I’m fun.
36285,Sheldon,What are you doing here?
36286,Leonard,We? No no no you had your chance to be we for like a year and a half now. Right now you are you and you are screwed.
36287,Penny,Oh we would love that.
36288,Leonard,Well too late pal. I’m not going anywhere. Penny and I are very happy living together. Isn’t that right?
36289,Penny,Hey. Where’d you go? I can’t tell if the turkey’s done.
36290,Penny,Um well Howard and Christie are… kind of… hooking up in my bedroom.
36291,Leonard,A little yeah.
36292,Raj,Is that enough to melt the lug nut?
36293,Sheldon,There’s doubt?
36294,Leonard,Okay don’t take this as a criticism but you kind of have that overexposed-to-gamma-rays thing going on.
36295,Raj,I need an aspirin.
36296,Penny,Okay that’s enough.
36297,Leonard,Are you kidding me? After all we’ve been through I just want to go home.
36298,Leonard,What?
36299,Penny,God what is wrong with me.
36300,Raj,He never went back to the university?
36301,Leonard,Okay then we won’t touch the hard drive. We’ll just erase the first season of Battlestar.
36302,Raj,Great idea. I haven’t had a carbohydrate in two weeks. These cheekbones need to be in front of a camera before I eat a pretzel and they’re gone.
36303,Sheldon,I have some odd freckles on my buttocks. Can I make an appointment for you to look at them?
36304,Penny,Never.
36305,Leonard,Hey guys come on in.
36306,Penny,Was it a good one?
36307,Sheldon,You’re defacing my work.
36308,Penny,Why don’t we all stop hitting ourselves and talk about something safe you know like shoes or how cute little Chinese babies are.
36309,Raj,Wait what are you doing? I can’t scissors by myself! Howard! Come back!
36310,Leonard,Howard did you solve the install time problem yet?
36311,Leonard,May the force be with you. Get it?
36312,Sheldon,Very well. Can I ask you a question about women?
36313,Raj,What? The the guy who plays Jon Snow was a jerk. We still watch Game of Thrones.
36314,Sheldon,Darn. I can’t seem to get the hang of that.
36315,Leonard,Yeah thank you.
36316,Penny,Well what about Howard and Raj I mean how did you become friends with them?
36317,Leonard,I don’t know I wasn’t choosing my…
36318,Sheldon,Well I’m sorry Leonard I’m a problem-solver it’s what I do.
36319,Leonard,How am I betraying you?
36320,Penny,Hey look who’s back.
36321,Sheldon,Why? I got away with it. Leonard has his toy and he’s never going to open it so he won’t know it’s broken. And I have a toy that isn’t broken. Everybody’s happy.
36322,Sheldon,Penny.
36323,Penny,Oh sweetie. You really can’t hold your liquor can you?
36324,Raj,W-w-with women. I like to boogie with women.
36325,Sheldon,Okay. If you think being nice will get him to shut up I’ll try it.
36326,Sheldon,Mountain Elf.
36327,Sheldon,That’s as far as I’ve gotten.
36328,Howard,Poor Roger Abbott.
36329,Sheldon,It depends on the activity. For a prostate exam yes. If you’re playing Vegas I’d add sequins.
36330,Sheldon,I’m fine.
36331,Raj,No I’m not gay. If anything I’m metrosexual.
36332,Raj,What’s wrong with you?
36333,Leonard,Go away.
36334,Howard,Well it’s getting late. Maybe we should head home.
36335,Leonard,You may have actually just come up with something.
36336,Sheldon,Wait. Uh which is closer to the new train store in Monrovia the movie theatre or the Cheesecake Factory?
36337,Leonard,It’s hard to believe Howard’s having a kid.
36338,Penny,Got it.
36339,Leonard,If it makes you feel any better when I was dating Penny she used to flip out on me all the time.
36340,Sheldon,Only 211. Don’t worry in deference to you I’ve kept them on a high school graduate reading level.
36341,Sheldon,All right picture this a beautiful outdoor concert. Now as a human I appreciate Beethoven. As a fungus I have a terrific view growing out of a towering maple tree. And no thank you expensive concessions. Because as an algae I’ll just snack on this sunlight.
36342,Sheldon,I’m the Doppler Effect.
36343,Leonard,She made him a chore chart.
36344,Sheldon,You know what I like to do when I’m forced to speak with those beneath my intellectual station? I bring up an interesting topic like the difference between Spider-Man and spiders.
36345,Leonard,You do?
36346,Howard,Well if you want to guarantee his appeal to Stephanie your best bet would be to kill all the other men on the planet.
36347,Leonard,Yeah. Hey.
36348,Sheldon,Oh goodie put him on speaker phone.
36349,Penny,Okay like what?
36350,Sheldon,Are you insane? If she leaves it’s over!
36351,Sheldon,Whee!
36352,Howard,Correct.
36354,Leonard,Hey Sheldon clear your weekend. Starting Saturday morning Star Wars< marathon
36355,Leonard,That may well be but the fact is it wouldn’t kill us to meet some new people.
36356,Leonard,Penny was a struggling actress when we met and now she’s a successful pharmaceutical rep.
36357,Penny,Yeah except the river kept showing me his Pokémon cards.
36358,Sheldon,Hello.
36359,Leonard,I don’t believe this. Why am I the last to know?
36360,Raj,It’s true but on the other hand you are wearing a bird sweater.
36361,Penny,Yeah. Yeah. No no. Um. So it’s getting pretty late. We should probably go to sleep.
36363,Leonard,Secondly I can’t think of a more horrible idea than Penny meeting Mandy.
36364,Sheldon,You can’t do that. Not only is it a violation of California state law it flies directly in the face of Cheesecake Factory policy.
36365,Penny,Yeah my friend from Omaha plays the guitar. Anyway he’s coming to L.A. looking for some session work so I told him he could just crash on my couch for a few weeks.
36366,Sheldon,My goodness do you remember comes with apsparagus?
36367,Sheldon,You appear to have put your car key in the door lock are you aware of that?
36368,Sheldon,I’ve been doing some research online and apparently female primates you know uh apes chimpanzees you they find their mate more desirable when he’s being courted by another female. Now this effect is intensified when the rival female is secreting the pheromones associated with ovulation. Which brings me back to my question where are you in . Clearly I’m 14 days too early.
36369,Sheldon,Well played. Sometimes I don’t give you enough credit Penny.
36370,Leonard,Anyway as I was saying Sheldon probably just needs a little alone time. ‘Cause that’s important. Not just for him but for most anybody really.
36371,Howard,Yeah it’s nothing to cry about.
36372,Raj,It is. If you like wandering around a big empty house with no one to love you.
36373,Sheldon,It was like the rest of the class wanted Ms. McDonald to forget the quiz.
36374,Leonard,Huh? Cos it looks a lot like breakfast.
36375,Leonard,I’ll take my chances.
36376,Leonard,We should let you guys talk.
36377,Leonard,You kept walking. I think you did.
36378,Raj,You’re making me sound like a caveman.
36379,Howard,Are you still going to tell him about you-know-who?
36380,Penny,Thank you.
36381,Sheldon,Well perhaps we should hold up a sign that assures passing motorists of our mental competence.
36382,Penny,Let me ask you a question when did you guys start feeling grown up? ‘Cause I am not sure I do.
36383,Penny,Okay he is not dying.
36384,Sheldon,Not necessarily. I’m often surprised by my lack of familiarity with Leonard. Just the other day I discovered he not only has a loofah he hides it. Why do you suppose a man would be ashamed of having a loofah? I myself prefer to have my excess epithelial cells slough off naturally but I don’t condemn those who seek to accelerate the process.  
36385,Sheldon,Fine. Bad.
36386,Penny,That’s enough.
36387,Sheldon,Oh I don’t know uh weather uh fish you could do carpentry with why Leonard is such an attractive and desirable boyfriend. Yeah pick one your choice.
36388,Sheldon,Oh Penny? Penny?
36389,Raj,Fine. Go ahead.
36390,Penny,Okay so it’s not a legal ceremony it’s just a chance for us to redo our vows so everyone can be part of it.
36391,Penny,‘Cause I do that I do overreact. Maybe I should call Mike and apologise.
36392,Penny,Yes. Please find someone who cares.
36393,Howard,Man I’m worn out.
36394,Raj,Ah really? Thank you. Fate has given me a rare second chance and I swear to Vishnu I’m not gonna blow it. Or normal words followed by a charming smile.
36395,Leonard,Calm down. We’ll figure it out.
36396,Sheldon,Me? I’ll give you a hint. Neeeeooooowwwww!
36397,Sheldon,There’s that prostate doctor but I’m still mad at her. Oh there’s a woman. I’ll make her my girlfriend.
36398,Penny,As evidenced by your boyfriend and his fear of hamsters.
36399,Howard,Uh Origin of Species.
36400,Leonard,Sheldon you have to let somebody else answer.
36401,Sheldon,No. It upsets Sheldon when she willy-nilly takes it from the containers without regard for its equitable distribution. This is essentially why you have famine in India.
36402,Penny,Oh. I say a lot of things sweetie. So how about it Sheldon?
36403,Howard,Welcome to another classic Koothrappali murder mystery dinner.
36404,Leonard,I don’t know how do carbon atoms form a benzene ring? Proximity and valence electrons.
36405,Howard,I do appreciate that.
36406,Penny,I work at the Cheesecake Factory I said bye.
36407,Leonard,That’s three minutes. Should we see what we got?
36408,Leonard,How about that.
36409,Leonard,Yeah.
36410,Leonard,Good. Remember that when I take my shirt off.
36411,Howard,Fine tell us you’re going to have sex with Penny.
36412,Leonard,Yeah sure.
36413,Leonard,What’s going on?
36414,Howard,I don’t think it matters. Look Sheldon I believe when the time is right for you to meet someone it’ll just happen. Okay? Not because of a test or a Web site but because…  we are the dreamers of dreams.
36415,Howard,Hold on hold on.
36416,Howard,No if we got Captain Reynolds from Firefly to do a signing at Stuart’s store that would be amazing.
36417,Leonard,Sheldon I didn’t mean it like that.
36418,Leonard,So you’ll go to the Doctor Who convention with me next week?
36419,Howard,Well here’s your key back.
36420,Penny,Okay you know what? Maybe I’ll take Amy with me to the spa this weekend instead.
36421,Leonard,Penny is not the reason I didn’t pursue that idea.
36422,Sheldon,Let me give you an example. Earlier today I decoded the headers on your e-mail and I know that your name is Kenneth Fitzgerald. From that I figured out where you live and where you work. Now to make this a Mexican standoff I would say something like uh you give us the helium or I’ll turn you in to the authorities.
36423,Penny,And you talked?
36424,Leonard,Aw the pet store?
36425,Sheldon,Dr. Sheldon Cooper theoretical physicist Caltech.
36426,Raj,What do you think Sheldon? Want an action figure that looks just like you?
36427,Leonard,Here we go.
36428,Sheldon,I present to you the relationship agreement. A binding covenant that in its 31 pages enumerates iterates and codifies the rights and responsibilities of Sheldon Lee Cooper here and after known as the boyfriend and Amy Farrah Fowler here and after known as the girlfriend.
36429,Penny,Well where are we going?
36430,Sheldon,All right. I officially reinstate Anything Can Happen Thursday.
36431,Penny,Well uh it looked pretty good in the store.
36432,Leonard,Oh I know what he’s saying and he’s not he’s not funny.
36433,Raj,You know I kind of feel bad about what we did to him. 
36434,Leonard,Interesting.
36435,Leonard,Aren’t you gonna ask?
36436,Leonard,The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
36437,Raj,All right. Uh would would it be okay for me to see her? We’re usually in bed by now and I want her to know that I’m here. Yes we sleep together and sometimes we spoon.
36438,Raj,Let’s leave Leonard out of this for the moment. This is about you and me.
36439,Sheldon,It pains me to say it but I think some form of penalty is in order so as to discourage this type of behaviour in the future.
36440,Sheldon,I did it. Had to go to three clothing stores but we finally found a dress that could envelop your mother.
36441,Sheldon,Next year I’m going to Epcot.
36442,Raj,Sheldon is there a place on this train to get alcohol?
36444,Howard,You know I kind of feel bad about what we did to him. 
36445,Leonard,So Dennis how long have you been in America.
36446,Leonard,Oh my god what did you do?
36447,Leonard,There’s a principle at stake.
36448,Raj,I say okey-dokey.
36449,Sheldon,What just happened?
36450,Raj,We’re glad you could make it.
36451,Sheldon,Forgive my language but poppycock.
36453,Sheldon,That seems acceptable.
36454,Raj,No hi Raj? No how are you Raj? Just straight to where’s the other white guy?
36455,Sheldon,None of your business. But when you see me wearing a flower in my lapel later you are most welcome to sniff it.
36456,Raj,Nice place. Reminds me of my parents’ house back in New Delhi.
36457,Penny,What?
36458,Leonard, Amy. Bye.
36459,Sheldon,Now who would do that?
36460,Sheldon,Was he the one who wedgied you so hard your testicle reascended and you spent your whole Christmas break waiting for it to come back down?
36461,Penny,What?
36462,Howard,All right guys what game do you want to play?
36463,Sheldon,Bad idea.
36464,Sheldon,I’m the Flash. I just knocked 30000 times.
36465,Leonard,Hang on. Let’s talk about it. This is a National Science Foundation expedition. I don’t know how we can turn it down.
36466,Penny,Pants but Leonard says sex doesn’t count.
36467,Howard,Oh no. At home. The servants would sing to me laugh at my jokes. I wish I knew their names.
36468,Leonard,Oh don’t worry. They gave me this vibrating coaster.
36469,Leonard,Please the only thing he needs me for is to be his whipping boy his his stooge his doormat.
36470,Sheldon,Can we get back to work?
36471,Sheldon,Well that was fun. Good for you Leonard.
36472,Penny,What?
36473,Leonard,Oh Dr. Siebert twelve o’clock.
36474,Leonard,One more floor and I’d be the pulled muscle.
36475,Raj,Why don’t you put your mother in a home?
36476,Howard,Think about this. The only way your mother was born was your Meemaw had sex.
36477,Penny,There you go.
36478,Leonard,Yes.
36479,Leonard,Yeah time’s gonna fly by.
36480,Sheldon,By the way your name can go first.
36481,Penny,It’s fun talking to you Leonard I always learn stuff.
36482,Leonard,On what?
36483,Raj,Very good Bernadette. You are a regular Byomkesh Bakshi.
36484,Sheldon,Do it.
36485,Leonard,Oh this guy wanted a place of his own because he was sure he was gonna be a ladies’ man.
36486,Penny,Why wouldn’t she approve of me? I’m adorable.
36487,Sheldon,Why? Why would we change? We had a perfectly good palace. Tandoori Palace is our palace.
36488,Sheldon,I would like a root beer float.
36489,Sheldon,Terrific you’ll be happy to know that I plan to come here every Tuesday night for the foreseeable future.
36490,Penny,I think we’re good.
36491,Leonard,That tonight’s gonna be a good night and tonight’s gonna be a good night and tonight’s gonna be a good good night! Tonight’s the night uh uh let’s live it up uh I got my money let’s spend it up…
36492,Raj,That depends. On any level do you think she’s hot?
36493,Howard,Maybe he’s playing bingo with his mommy.
36494,Penny,We’re not getting divorced.
36495,Raj,Ooh what if we got a van and drove around and picked kids up?
36496,Howard,He loves you.
36497,Leonard,Don’t rule out the dating.
36498,Penny,Okay.
36499,Leonard,Still arguing over which CSI is the best?
36500,Sheldon,No weapon strikes more fear into a man’s heart than a Klingon bat’leth.
36502,Leonard,So uh what’s the deal? You take off your ring when you go to work?
36503,Sheldon,Really?
36504,Howard,I just read a book about Oppenheimer seemed like a chance to show off.  There he is there’s my happy Hebraic homeboy. Yeah that’s the smile I’m gonna remember when you’re living in the desert and I’m living with your wife.
36505,Raj,You started it dude.
36506,Sheldon,You hear that? Raj is devastated.
36507,Penny,Right because me being in school is so important to you. That way you wouldn’t have to be dating someone who’s only a waitress.
36508,Leonard,That doesn’t sound like mocking.
36509,Leonard,Want some more wine?
36510,Leonard,Sure.
36511,Howard,But you finished your experiment a week ago.
36512,Raj,It’s a gravitational wobble. It could be a sign of an extrasolar planet that may contain life and someday be named after me.
36513,Sheldon,Good news. I finally have a handle on my idea for three-person chess.
36514,Raj,The only person allowed inside this head is Dr. Phil. Anyway I I spoke to my new lady friend about meeting you all and she thought it would be easier for her to start with just one.
36515,Leonard,Oh that’s nice but it-it’s just gonna be a room full of boring old men and I’m not sure how much help you’d be.
36516,Penny,She’s adorable Howard. I think you’ll like her.
36517,Leonard,If she can do it I can do it. If she can do it I can do it. If she can do it I can do it.  I can’t do it.
36518,Raj,I didn’t get a good look. Can I go again?
36519,Penny,What’s the word hummingbird?
36520,Sheldon,They lie so they don’t look petty.
36521,Penny,With-with loofah mitts no hands.
36522,Leonard,It’s up to you. He didn’t call your experiment stupid.
36523,Raj,Yeah.
36524,Penny,Hey you guys want to play a drinking game?
36525,Howard,Or we could walk right behind each other all night and look like one person going really fast.
36526,Sheldon,Given that your hands prepared it isn’t that a little self-serving?
36527,Penny,Well that’s not gonna happen.
36528,Raj,Or is Sherlock Holmes the English Byomkesh Bakshi?
36529,Leonard,Nice going Raj just got him down for his nap.
36530,Leonard,Thank you.
36531,Sheldon,Oh. Well good job quite convincing. I smell perfume.
36532,Sheldon,Hello. I see you decided to go with pathetic and frightened.
36533,Leonard,Because when I made that agreement I didn’t think I’d ever have a hot girlfriend. And I was positive you never would.
36534,Raj,I did the research. Tony the Tiger Dig’em the Frog Cap’n Crunch Toucan Sam Count Chocula Trix the Rabbit Snap Crackle and Pop. Not one cereal mascot is a girl. It’s a total breakfast sausage fest.
36535,Sheldon,There was a tall man from Cornwall whose length exceeded his bed. My body fits on it but barely upon it there’s no room for my big Cornish head.
36536,Leonard,Okay. And when would that be?
36537,Sheldon,I was beating him so bad he doesn’t want to be friends anymore. Why does everyone love me except Stephen Hawking?
36538,Sheldon,Notify the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary the word plenty has been redefined to mean two.
36539,Leonard,Um I’m not sure but I think the right answer here is no.
36540,Howard,Thank you. It wasn’t easy.
36541,Sheldon,Great. New topic. Where are you in your menstrual cycle?
36542,Leonard,I doubt he’ll ask you to kill a man.
36543,Leonard,Well they don’t have an Excalibur here so what do you want to do?
36544,Raj,You know the government funded the biggest experiment yet to detect dark matter.
36545,Sheldon,We’ll make it nice put out a spread.
36547,Sheldon,You know speaking of attorneys if I ever needed a lawyer I would not hire She-Hulk.
36548,Leonard,You do?
36549,Sheldon,All right Boggle warriors kapla’!
36550,Sheldon,Your driving the plethora of stuffed animals on your bed that stare at him during your amorous activities your constant tardiness your singing.
36551,Leonard,Hi Amy. Sheldon’s not here.
36552,Sheldon,If I can interject here obviously Leonard is concerned that his mother won’t approve of you as his mate.
36554,Sheldon,Oh no this is pomegranate juice. It’s all the fun of high school high jinks with the cell-protecting zip of antioxidants.
36555,Leonard,Come on it’s your turn. We said we’d get more fresh air.
36556,Howard,This is exciting.
36557,Penny,Yeah get to the point I’m about to level up here.
36558,Sheldon,Ah this is fun.
36559,Penny,Leonard?
36560,Sheldon,You can’t do that if you make a mark on a mint comic book it’s no longer mint.
36562,Leonard,I’d make fun of Sheldon for having girl problems if I wasn’t in shock that Sheldon has girl problems.
36563,Howard,How did you get your hands on that?
36565,Raj,Amy I’m really sorry. I didn’t mean to upset you.
36566,Penny,Yeah and when I dropped her off at the hotel she even gave me a hug.
36567,Sheldon,Well I’m not sure about interesting but…
36568,Leonard,Chosen by science?
36569,Leonard,Yeah.
36570,Howard,Three hundred and I’ll throw in my original 1979 Mattel Millenium Falcon with real light speed sound effects.
36571,Leonard,Wow.
36572,Penny,Yeah I’m also doing it for Leonard. I think this could really help their relationship.
36573,Leonard,Why would I lie?
36574,Penny,And not only am I Leonard’s mother but we have this man-child living with us named Sheldon.
36575,Sheldon,You’re Kirk I’m Spock Wolowitz is Scotty Koothrappali is the guy who always gets killed and now we’ve got McCoy.
36576,Sheldon,My struggle is emotional.
36577,Sheldon,Sadly it’s not. Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle but beyond that I have realised that the Leo I described would not have agreed to go to rehab.
36578,Leonard,Uh-uh.
36579,Sheldon,jlyajbe’. DaH nep’a’ Penny? 
36580,Howard,Are they actually arguing about comic books?
36581,Penny,What?
36582,Leonard,No.
36583,Leonard,No he’s bluffing.
36584,Penny,Yeah back when I was dating Zack. It was actually more fun than I thought. We gambled we went to one of those cheesy wedding chapels we had a really good turkey dinner. Which was surprising since we were at a strip club.
36585,Penny,Yeah.
36586,Leonard,Uh it means if anyone displeases me I don’t help them set up their printer.
36587,Leonard,No no no no. I take it back. Don’t say it. Just just hate me but stay with me. It worked for my parents.
36588,Sheldon,If I were to give you this gift basket based on that action alone and no other data infer and describe the hypothetical relationship that exists between us.
36589,Sheldon,Hardly. Consider this unlikely but very plausible scenario. A young woman alone in the big city. Her ridiculous dream of becoming an actress lies shattered about her.
36590,Leonard,Okay now what I’m hearing is that you feel that I sometimes take too long to express myself and you wish I’d be more succinct.
36591,Leonard,So I guess it’s a good thing we stopped for dinner.
36592,Raj,I agree. That is if you’ve never been to or heard of a party before.
36593,Leonard,Thank you. . Shall I count down from three?
36594,Penny,Is that better?
36595,Raj,Or it turned into mustard Kryptonite the only way to destroy a rogue Kryptonian hotdog threatening Earth.
36596,Raj,Oh it’s okay. I have no morals and I’m desperately lonely. I’ll be the other man if you want a little something-something on the side.
36597,Leonard,Is someone sick?
36598,Sheldon,Made necessary by her insistence on going into my room.
36599,Penny,What do you have eyes in the back of your head?
36600,Sheldon,Oh hey. If you knocked I couldn’t hear you. I’m welding this locomotive engine. And if you didn’t knock how about some manners?
36601,Sheldon,Really Leonard. Insults? After I spent two hours in your closet waiting for you to fall asleep?
36602,Penny,Oh sweetie you might not live that long.
36603,Howard,No no no I’m going to have a me day. First I’m going to go to one of those spas in Koreatown take a steam and get a massage. Then I’m going to stop at a pet store and get licked by puppies.
36604,Sheldon,But we need a cryogenic centrifugal pump.
36605,Raj,Hey the future they show in Back to the Future II is only a year away. A lot of the things in that movie haven’t been invented yet.
36606,Penny,What are you doing?
36607,Penny,You didn’t tell me for a year?
36608,Howard,I can’t believe I’m sitting here next to little Lalita Gupta.
36609,Raj,Well what if we put out a lite version for half a million? You know get the word of mouth going.
36610,Penny,I just want you guys to know I am really grateful for your help and for every dollar I make I’m going to give you 20 cents.
36612,Sheldon,I intend to write that soap company a strongly worded letter.
36613,Sheldon,I drank milk that tasted funny.
36615,Penny,I don’t know empathy? Anyway I’m just saying that you’re feeling upset about something with Howard and I’m upset about something with Leonard.
36616,Raj,And I just want you to know I’m happy to look in on Bernadette while you’re gone.
36618,Leonard,Absolutely. If you admit that you’re a 30-year-old man who’s incapable of functioning on his own.
36619,Leonard,Let me see let me see. One calls it insightful and innovative. We’re insightful and innovative.
36620,Sheldon,By that reasoning we should also play bridge hold up a chuppah and enter the Olympic bobsled competition.
36621,Sheldon,Dr. Rostenkowski it may interest you to know that saying pew pew pew isn’t as effective as pressing your blaster key. In the same way that saying whee doesn’t make the land speeder go.
36622,Sheldon,Oh that kid. Poor Leonard.
36623,Raj,How did that work out?
36624,Raj,Well can I say she looks nice?
36625,Howard,Come on I just told you I had a girlfriend. The least you can do is tell me if we had a vibe.
36626,Leonard,Fine.
36627,Howard,How could you say that?
36628,Sheldon,A physics point.
36629,Penny,What’s up buttercup?
36630,Leonard,Thank you.
36631,Sheldon,You know Italian housewives have a rule of thumb. A handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter is sufficient for each person as it doubles in volume when cooked.
36632,Leonard,He just won’t listen to me.
36633,Howard,Three two one.
36634,Sheldon,Let’s see what’s next? Okay here. This is the Magic Marker I was using when I made the discovery.
36635,Raj,At least my nose is naturally brown.
36636,Howard,But I just broke up with my girlfriend.
36637,Leonard,Fine. What would you like to talk about Sheldon?
36638,Penny,Yeah.
36639,Leonard,I do.
36640,Raj,Insurance is gonna buy you a new car. It’s not gonna de-funk my junk.
36641,Sheldon,This is remarkable. Took less than 24 hours.
36642,Sheldon,Fine but if I come out of this looking like a dork it’s on you. 
36643,Leonard,We’re pinned down.
36644,Penny,Now now there’s no need to make this emotional.
36645,Penny,What? He paid off her credit cards? Damn it I could’ve dated Raj for a couple months. But I I wouldn’t have because I’m not that kind of girl. We should really talk to Raj.
36646,Leonard,She’s here she’s here. How do I look? Do I look smart?
36647,Howard,Well I texted you but you didn’t respond. Leonard and Penny were arguing.
36648,Sheldon,Well the contents are irrelevant. A legal bailment has been created. Does that mean nothing to you?
36649,Sheldon,Cohabitation with my girlfriend? That’s a great deal to process.
36650,Howard,Insurance is gonna buy you a new car. It’s not gonna de-funk my junk.
36651,Sheldon,Oh I have a feeling that once you start you’re not gonna want to or be allowed to stop.
36652,Sheldon,Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced not shredded?
36653,Howard,You can do it.
36654,Raj,I’m telling you dude the only way to feel better about Penny going out with other guys is for you to get back on the whores.
36655,Penny,Oh well ’cause you know we’re gonna do bad.
36656,Raj,This is the difference between eating and dining.
36657,Sheldon,Well I was thinking put your head out the window like a dog but that’ll work. Please? This’ll be quick. Leonard? As soon as we get home I want to have coitus with Amy. Okay she can’t hear. The reason I called you is because I didn’t want Amy to know I couldn’t make it on my own.
36658,Howard,Genius. I was gonna say why does anyone think Sheldon’s a genius? But I didn’t.
36659,Leonard,I don’t want beef jerky.
36660,Raj,Your girlfriend and your ex-girlfriend are hanging out together? Oh yeah that can only be good for you.
36662,Penny,Yeah that’ll hold me for a while.
36663,Penny,Maybe the fact that you went and had a baby.
36664,Penny,Wow. Oh okay well I’ll just come visit you.
36665,Sheldon,Yes I suppose he is.
36666,Raj,Thank you.
36667,Penny,How would you say it?
36668,Penny,Um gee the exact words aren’t written… it’s more the spirit in which it’s
36669,Howard,Really? Well oh okay one mystery solved.
36670,Raj,What?
36671,Howard,Hey.
36672,Sheldon,If I had a million guesses I never would have gotten that.
36673,Leonard,Hey how about if we pretend we’re actually on a first date? See how that goes.
36674,Sheldon,How shall we begin?
36675,Penny,You’re kidding.
36676,Howard,Nice. So mmm. What’s up?
36677,Sheldon,No it’s too late. I see it. That elf sticker says to Sheldon. The die has been cast the moving finger has writ Hannibal has crossed the Alps.
36678,Sheldon,No.
36679,Leonard,Yeah it’s like if Alien and Predator decided to go partners in a Jamba Juice.
36680,Sheldon,Do you supply the the tennis ball?
36681,Leonard,Long before the cats. I think it was around the time he tried to declare our apartment a sovereign nation. I still have some of the currency.
36682,Sheldon,I heard a noise.
36683,Leonard,Okay is everyone clear on the plan?
36684,Howard,Really? You kept sending me apartment listings.
36685,Leonard,Come on. It wasn’t my fault.
36686,Sheldon,Sarcasm?
36688,Sheldon,Are you going to help me or not?
36689,Leonard,What?
36690,Leonard,I think Penny likes to skate. The four of us could double.
36691,Sheldon,I always prefer the train.
36692,Raj,The mysterious subcontinent of India.
36693,Leonard,I wet the bed until college but I don’t think that’s a quality fix.
36694,Leonard,Hey Stuart I need to talk to you.
36695,Leonard,Okay. Great. How do you want to start?
36696,Penny,Damn it. What do you want me to do
36697,Sheldon,I can’t comment without violating our agreement that I don’t criticize your work.
36698,Howard,A medium-sized asteroid.
36699,Sheldon,May I borrow your water?
36700,Leonard,I’m telling you try the hanger.
36701,Sheldon,Raj now I’m sorry you’re suffering. When Amy and I were broken up I also suffered. And this may sound surprising but I’m grateful for having gone through it.
36702,Howard,I’m the son of a gynaecologist. I could be helpful.
36703,Leonard,I got to tell you I’m a little worried about him.
36704,Leonard,I didn’t dream that?
36705,Penny,Mm-hmm?
36706,Penny,No keep your money.
36707,Sheldon,Not a clue. Raj?
36708,Penny,How else is she supposed to take it?
36709,Howard,So where are we going?
36710,Sheldon,Oh right a present for Leonard. You better throw in that squirt gun.
36711,Raj,We’re both frauds.
36712,Penny,Somewhere where no one’s seen me naked. We may have to drive awhile. 
36713,Leonard,So where do we want to hang it?
36714,Howard,Yeah. Huh. Forty-three? What the hell does that mean?
36715,Penny,Ooh ooh shut the door shut the door.
36716,Howard,Okay.
36717,Howard,Why did you even go to dinner with the guy?
36718,Sheldon,Oh come on. I really wanted to tell someone they can’t come in.
36719,Sheldon,You don’t really believe in that superstition do you?
36720,Penny,You’re gonna lick the salt off my neck do the shot and then bite the lime.
36721,Leonard,Why not?
36722,Sheldon,Mom you remember Rajesh? Rajesh my mother.
36723,Sheldon,I helped run some cable for a webcam.
36724,Sheldon,Using in vitro fertilization and a surrogate uterus to gift humanity with our progeny.
36725,Leonard,Excuse me?
36726,Penny,Yes you don’t always have to go along with what the woman wants.
36727,Sheldon,No if we fill up on dumplings we’ll need to eliminate another entree.
36728,Sheldon,Yay! And they say firefighters are the real heroes.
36729,Raj,To what? Toy Story?
36730,Penny,Want to go to Vegas this weekend?
36731,Sheldon,Oh this is already better. There are far fewer distractions in here.
36732,Penny,Just finish your ice cream so I can get you home to bed.
36733,Raj,Leonard please. The man is talking. Let him get it out and let the chips fall where they may.
36734,Penny,You know what? I did it. What’s four bucks?
36735,Leonard,Thank you.
36736,Leonard,Stop saying meeting.
36737,Leonard,Leslie you are way off base here.
36738,Leonard,That’s beautiful. Is that Shakespeare?
36739,Sheldon,Well to be honest I thought she said Yoda.
36740,Sheldon,Yes.
36741,Penny,I know it’s kinda weird.
36742,Leonard,Do you really want that?
36743,Sheldon,He’s referring to an activity he has done before. It’s unpleasant and needs to be repeated. This suggests some sort of invasive medical test like perhaps a colonoscopy.
36744,Leonard,So what’s your news Bernadette?
36745,Howard,How’d you do that?
36747,Leonard,No no no  no I don’t think that’s where it was.
36748,Penny,Okay um hey God. What’s up? Um I’m good but uh it would be a big help to my family if you could get my brother to stop cooking meth. But no cops. Be cool.
36749,Penny,Little lower to the left. A little more.
36750,Leonard,Hang on I’m gonna give you a little early Christmas present. I’m gonna show you something but if you ever told Sheldon he’d probably never speak to me again. So if you want to tell him that’s fine. Look.
36751,Penny,Okay new topic please. Hey did you hear the people upstairs in 5A are moving out?
36752,Sheldon,Good. Oh I watched a video of the hagfish producing mucus so I’m gonna change my answer and eat SpongeBob.
36753,Leonard,When was your honour insulted?
36754,Sheldon,Okay Penny if it were a game here are your choices. An e-mail from an old acquaintance or the head of one of the largest religious institutions in the world slam dunking to Sweet Georgia Brown. Pick.
36755,Penny,Yeah well I’m at work too and you’ll never guess who’s here infecting my entire station.
36756,Penny,Come on open it. I bet it says something great.
36757,Penny,Why? I can do it right here.
36758,Leonard,Hey I am a young man in his sexual prime. Under the right conditions I-I-I am capable of just really crazy stuff.
36759,Penny,My mirth. Classic.
36760,Sheldon,You know Sherlock Holmes liked to use cocaine to sharpen his focus. But I’m sure those Cool Ranch Doritos are doing the trick.
36761,Leonard,I’m going to work. You can come if you want.
36762,Leonard,Mr. Jeffries I’m I’m Leonard. This is my girlfriend Penny.
36763,Howard,Right. Good catch. Anyway so I’m sorry to waste your time. And uh and good luck with your screenplay.
36764,Penny,You were on set you saw what it was like.
36765,Raj,You being the fish.
36766,Leonard,Yes
36767,Leonard,That’s an atom.
36768,Penny,It’s not a big deal Sheldon. It’s just ever since Leonard’s been dating Raj’s sister I’ve had to keep my distance. I don’t get to hear all your jibber-jabber.
36769,Sheldon,No I was just excited to list him as a friend.
36770,Howard,And I just want you to know I’m happy to look in on Bernadette while you’re gone.
36771,Sheldon,You you and I spend a lot of time together. Can there be a little mystery between us?
36772,Sheldon,Vexillology is the study of flags.
36773,Sheldon,Yes.
36774,Sheldon,What do you want to talk about?
36775,Leonard,Sheldon are you okay?
36776,Leonard,Sign right there.
36777,Sheldon,Huh. It would appear as if the phone companies have been lying to me.
36778,Sheldon,Bad. However…
36779,Leonard,That’s what your father used to say?
36780,Raj,If anybody cares I still have to pee.
36781,Sheldon,Yeah for now. But that woman has a death wish Leonard. She talks to strangers she pets unfamiliar dogs and it is ridiculously easy to break into her apartment. If I were you I’d get a back-up.
36783,Raj,Yeah I’m right here buddy. How are you?
36784,Howard,No.
36785,Howard,Yes. Where I can be jealous of the cup touching your ruby lips. Or you just write it for me.
36787,Leonard,Okay we cannot leave this to chance lets pick a girl and figure out how to get her together with Dennis.
36788,Penny,Okay the first question is on the topic of optics. What is the shortest light pulse ever produced? Dr Cooper.
36789,Leonard,Are you proud of yourself?
36790,Penny,All right. Well let’s just get them apart for a while so they can cool down.
36791,Sheldon,Ha. Keep dreaming.
36792,Penny,Sometimes I forget how smart you are.
36793,Penny,Did you feel guilty after kissing her?
36794,Sheldon,Stop it both of you. All this fighting I might as well be back with my parents! Damn it George I told you if you didn’t quit drinkin’ I’d leave you! Well I guess that makes you a liar ’cause I’m drunk as hell and you’re still here! Stop yelling! You’re making Sheldon cry! I’ll tell you what’s making Sheldon cry! That I let you name him Sheldon.
36795,Leonard,I have Sheldon that keeps most people away.
36796,Howard,Well do you support this?
36797,Leonard,Howard’s gonna sleep here tonight. He had a fight with his mother.
36798,Leonard,That that’s brilliant.
36799,Howard,Well we all knew this day was coming.
36800,Raj,She was looking for a husband so she can appear to be straight. And you know it sounded crazy to me at first but I’m actually thinking about doing it.
36801,Sheldon,Howard said I could borrow it Bernadette said forever.
36802,Penny,Hey look at that. You both believe in Jewish bearded guys.
36803,Raj,Hang on. Oh no. Oh no. Oh God no.
36804,Leonard,I wasn’t swinging around a pole.
36805,Penny,So you’re saying if I became a famous movie star we got married you wouldn’t sign a pre-nup?
36806,Sheldon,What do they have?
36807,Raj,Come on. One more time. Yeah it’s it’s a little blurry but I think that works in your favour. Do you want a beer?
36808,Sheldon,You donate eggs. We will place them in cryogenic storage. I will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs have them fertilized and implanted in you that way everybody wins.
36809,Howard,It wouldn’t kill you to pick up the phone.
36810,Penny,No! It wasn’t a betrayal. It was more of a can’t afford any more points on my license. I already have to buy my insurance from this place in the Cayman Islands.
36811,Penny,Oh no.
36812,Leonard,To uh Lucky Baldwin’s.
36813,Sheldon,Well for our first time hosting I thought it would be wise to conduct a trial run. You know like how I practiced for that Halloween haunted house by going into the bathroom at the bus station.
36814,Howard,Actually I was going to suggest me.
36815,Howard,Hey it’s not my fault if American women project their fantasies on foreigners with the kind of magical voice that grants wishes.
36816,Sheldon,She said my name first that must kill you.
36817,Sheldon,You asked Penny if she wanted to hear something weird.
36818,Sheldon,And who performed that heroic act?
36819,Sheldon,Well Alfred has secrets too.
36820,Leonard,Sheldon?
36821,Howard,That is so cool. Old broken things are so much better than new things that work.
36822,Leonard,I’m not saying that.
36823,Sheldon,You’re right. Which makes your betrayal all the more devastating.
36824,Howard,Well I don’t know if you realize this but I bought that crib.
36825,Sheldon,Well I suppose. Come in. I’ll sleep in Leonard’s room. Good night.
36826,Leonard,Hey sorry we’re late.
36827,Leonard,Yeah it looks great.
36828,Leonard,I heard about it from Sheldon. He got it from Amy.
36829,Leonard,Really?
36830,Howard,Uh no. You had a long flight. You stay here and relax.
36831,Sheldon,Well thank you. How thoughtful. Would you like a chocolate
36832,Sheldon,How could there be with these constant interruptions?
36833,Raj,Sure.
36834,Sheldon,It took me nearly 20 minutes to go through the browser history on your computer to see what movie times you looked up. Wait here I’ll find us seats.
36835,Leonard,That’s my French toast.
36836,Sheldon,Amy it’s Penny’s turn. Penny?
36837,Howard,It’s pretty exciting that NASA wants to send Howard back up.
36838,Leonard,I’m missing something.  Did you say something to Penny about Alex?
36839,Penny,What do you mean nope? What’s wrong with it?
36840,Howard,Huh. Okay. As long as it doesn’t end with us having coitus with him I’m in.
36841,Sheldon,Um yes. Howdy partner. Do you happen to recollect if I left a notebook in these here parts?
36842,Sheldon,I am meeting you halfway I’m willing to concede that you’ve done some stupid things.
36843,Leonard,Absolutely not.
36844,Raj,I’m Raj by the way. This is Howard.
36845,Sheldon,Well I’m not much of a sports fan but thank you.
36846,Penny,Well it’s scary for me too.
36847,Penny,Hey it’s still early. Why don’t we go back and have that party?
36848,Leonard,That’s it that’s the line.
36849,Leonard,And instead of standing around watching you can help us build your smaller guidance system.
36850,Leonard,Listen don’t worry. I’ll talk to him.
36851,Howard,Look at that. I got a date with Penny. I can’t believe it took you a whole year.
36852,Sheldon,Yes.
36853,Sheldon,Very well. You leave me no choice.
36854,Penny,Yeah let’s try it again and maybe this time you could work on your body language a bit. You know when you’re all hunched like that you’re shutting the audience out but when you’re relaxed and open you’re inviting them in.
36855,Sheldon,A Halloween party?
36856,Sheldon,I’m not a child don’t do that.
36857,Penny,Really why?
36858,Sheldon,We get it you won the game. Stop bragging.
36859,Leonard,Oh what’d you get?
36860,Leonard,From Amy.
36861,Sheldon,Well you see while Leo would not have gone into rehab it is completely plausible that we would have talked him into leaving the motel and coming home with us.
36863,Leonard,Will you please turn your shirt off?
36864,Howard,Non-alcoholic bee-ee-eeuh 
36865,Leonard,Run Monte run!
36866,Sheldon,Oh alright. Leonard.
36867,Sheldon,How does one sort of…
36868,Leonard,Oh come on. Sheldon have you ever once heard me say that I don’t trust Penny? Sheldon? Where did he go?
36869,Leonard,Great. You have a girlfriend Howard’s got a girlfriend Sheldon’s got a girl…
36870,Howard,From there it was easy to find him on Instagram Snapchat and pretty much track his every movement.
36871,Leonard,Sheldon has kind of a photographic memory.
36872,Leonard,Yeah.
36873,Leonard,The new Star Wars movie.
36874,Sheldon,No I went to punch the water fountain slipped in water in front of the water fountain and hit my head on the water fountain.
36875,Sheldon,At the hands of those teenagers.
36876,Penny,I’m sorry?
36877,Sheldon,All right I’ll start with an easy one um Isaac Newton Madame Curie and Niels Bohr.
36878,Sheldon,Cholermus. It’s a traditional Swiss breakfast dish. I’m preparing my gastrointestinal system for the exotic cuisine of Switzerland.
36879,Leonard,Get into what? Why wouldn’t you love the chilli cheese fries? They’ve been in your life a long time. They make you happy. They deserve to know.
36880,Leonard,Damn straight almost 1am. And we weren’t even watching TV. We were watching Netflix like the kids do.
36881,Penny,Maybe I could do it.
36882,Howard,I’ll try it. Like this?
36883,Raj,Thank you. I thought it was inspired.
36884,Penny,Oh Sheldon can’t you do that yourself?
36885,Sheldon,Oh baguettes. Yes I like baguettes. What exactly are you doing?
36886,Penny,They’re not saying that.
36887,Penny,Hey guys. What you doing? Going out to discover electricity?
36888,Penny,No.
36889,Howard,You mean like when a guy’s upset because his friend agreed to take a cooking class with him and then doesn’t show up because he’s doing a juice fast with his mother?
36890,Sheldon,Well you doled out affection as a reward for achievement a proven way to raise a child. Or train a rat.
36891,Raj,I may not be liking this game so much.
36892,Leonard,Sheldon this date is probably my one chance with Penny what happens if I blow it.
36893,Penny,Oh Raj look at you!
36894,Penny,Sheldon congratulations. Brought you cheesecake from work. You know ’cause of your award not because a busboy sneezed on it.
36895,Sheldon,I’m surprised to see you here.
36896,Raj,I promise. Why what’s in there?
36897,Sheldon,Oh right. This is a disaster.
36898,Sheldon,What? You hold my hand you kiss my mouth but you draw the line at a hundred and two fever? What happened to our love?
36899,Leonard,Mm-hmm and what’s it called when you secretly get rid of all your husband’s stuff?
36900,Sheldon,Uh for the record it could kill us to meet new people. They could be murderers or the carriers of unusual pathogens and I’m not insane my mother had me tested.
36901,Penny,Sheldon did it ever occur to you that I might have other plans?
36902,Leonard,Uh a Hobbit is a mortal Halfling inhabitant of Middle Earth whereas an Elf is an immortal tall warrior.
36903,Penny,Uh Sheldon you want to take a break? Your food’s ready.
36904,Sheldon,No of course not there’s no cousin Leo there’s no intervention focus Leonard.
36905,Sheldon,I’m going to go inside put on my coziest pajamas curl up with a good book and wait for this nightmare to be over.  Penny. Sorry.
36906,Leonard,So?
36907,Raj,Can we not play this game?
36908,Leonard,When did we get a floor safe?
36909,Sheldon,Actually I thought the first two renditions were far more compelling. Previously I felt sympathy for the Leonard character now I just find him to be whiny and annoying.
36910,Sheldon,Aw. What is she doing here?
36911,Raj,Dad.
36912,Raj,Excuse me. I happen to be very comfortable with my masculinity.
36913,Raj,No.
36914,Howard,Terrific.
36915,Sheldon,Not for me. Thursday is now Cruciferous Vegetable Night. Tonight’s selection brussels sprouts.
36916,Penny,You know I will miss this.
36917,Sheldon,Well no I just didn’t think you’d want a physical reminder of a game you never managed to win. As a kindness I should probably take all the games.
36918,Raj,We hit a couple of bumps. She lives over on Manhattan Beach so it takes over an hour to get there. And she’s a lesbian.
36919,Leonard,Oh I miss you too.
36920,Leonard,Yeah but it’s not always that bad.
36921,Penny,Uh I don’t know. It was just a thought.
36922,Howard,Ah. Nothing makes beer taste better than cool clear Rocky Mountain spring water. Where are the Rocky Mountains anyway?
36923,Leonard,So I can’t go.
36924,Sheldon,Yes. All is forgiven so come back home. I’ll make you some soy hot chocolate and then I’ll you tell you about our exciting new devil-may-care bathroom policy.
36925,Sheldon,So that’s what you wear to an interview?
36926,Penny,Oh. Thanks.
36927,Penny,Okay we’re leaving love you bye.
36928,Howard,I’m very comfortable here. Penny dear why don’t you shoot another silver bullet my way?
36929,Penny,This is a door knob.
36930,Sheldon,It’s not about shoes is it? I don’t think I could go through that again.
36931,Penny,Wow.
36932,Sheldon,The zoot suit riots.
36933,Leonard,I don’t know. There’s still a bird in here. We are gonna get in a ton of trouble.
36934,Leonard,Hey pretty lady.
36935,Raj,I meant a Hindu temple.
36936,Penny,We sure did.
36938,Leonard,Penny’s hooking up with her jerk of an ex-boyfriend and I have indelible ink on my forehead!
36939,Leonard,How does your brain feel about calculating the surface tension of the domain walls?
36940,Howard,No you weren’t because it was a week ago and nobody came. So if you want to solve the mystery of who stabbed Koothrappali in the back with the weapon of indifference it was all of you.
36941,Raj,Then put on a sweater.
36942,Sheldon,Oh mimicry. I enjoy mimicry. I’ve been working on Admiral Ackbar from Return of the Jedi. “It’s a trap.” You have to imagine me with a giant squid head. “It’s a trap. It’s a trap. It’s a trap.”
36943,Penny,Oh yeah I don’t usually dress like this. I’m going jogging.
36944,Raj,What do you mean who cares? Look at what I pulled off here. The DJ’s on fire there’s a Tardis photo booth in the back room and oh my God the food. Stuart wanted Kraft Draculoni and cheese.
36946,Penny,What is that?
36947,Sheldon,Leonard social protocol states when a friend is upset you offer them a hot beverage such as tea.
36948,Penny,Well you know I do understand what you’re going through.
36949,Penny,I love you.
36950,Sheldon,Thank you for coming by.  Hello.
36951,Leonard,When you were telling Kevin about your acting career did you mention your long-running role as Waitress in a local production of The Cheesecake Factory?
36952,Sheldon,Oh I can help you with that. Imagine you’re holding an ordinary pen. While your favourite pen is safe and secure in your pocket.
36953,Howard,Five four three two one. That’s too bad.
36954,Sheldon,What’d you say of the idea of you and I becoming friends?
36955,Sheldon,Oh Indians making Tex-Mex. Might as well have had the Chinese pizza.
36956,Howard,Really?
36957,Leonard,Where are you going?
36958,Sheldon,Whatever.
36959,Leonard,No that’s okay.
36960,Howard,Well at least you finally got a window that opens. That’s nice.
36961,Raj,But a cannon? Am I really out of the game?
36962,Sheldon,Challenge accepted. Sounds like it’s time for the Sheldon Cooper Apology Tour.
36963,Raj,But Papa please….
36964,Sheldon,I should’ve brought an umbrella.
36965,Sheldon,No.
36966,Penny,Oh gee you’re too late. Scarlett Johansson and Wonder Woman were just in here trolling around for neurotic little weasels.
36967,Penny,No no no stay there. I’m fine on the floor.
36968,Sheldon,No you’re wrong. See as you know a few years ago I achieved one of my lesser dreams and became a notary public. Well from time to time I notarize banking documents for Raj. The Koothrappalis aren’t just rich they’re Richie Rich rich.
36969,Raj,It’s a human emotion Sheldon. Everyone gets jealous. I’m jealous of Leonard and Penny and Howard and Bernadette for being in such happy relationships.
36971,Howard,Don’t listen to him. He says crazy things all the time. Uh watch. Marco.
36972,Penny,Sheldon.
36973,Sheldon,Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me. Excuse me. Hi Stuart.
36974,Penny,Uh tell me more about this calzone idea.
36975,Raj,What are you saying that you’re giving up on me? What kind of father gives up on his son?
36976,Sheldon,Your first date? Did you even measure her walls?
36977,Penny,Will you be my valentine?
36978,Raj,I cannot thank you enough.
36979,Howard,Oh I was hoping for a juicy tidbit about Ron Perlman’s testicles.
36980,Penny,No no no I just meant for… yeah.
36981,Sheldon,I almost feel sorry for the poor fool sitting in his split-level suburban ranch unaware that a vengeful horde is barrelling down the San Diego Freeway at 71 miles an hour. Ease up there lead foot. You trying to get us killed?
36982,Howard,Great.
36983,Sheldon,And a second non-tantalizing piece to use as a control.
36984,Leonard,I don’t like trains. You like trains.
36985,Sheldon,Hurry. We’re going to be late.
36986,Leonard,Well I mean I’m sitting right here. You’re talking about my feelings and somehow leaving me out of the conversation.
36987,Leonard,Seriously that guy’s dating two women?
36988,Howard,What we’re ready when I say we’re ready. Uh-du-du-du ooh okay now we’re ready.
36989,Sheldon,No no no it’s… oh for God’s sakes gimme. 
36990,Howard,Yeah. Like his haircut material.
36991,Sheldon,I’d love to see a scan of your brain sometime.
36992,Penny,come on in.
36993,Leonard,I’m sorry?
36994,Penny,Don’t have one.
36995,Sheldon,I can’t.
36996,Leonard,Oh doesn’t seem like it. She got Sheldon to go to a psychic with her.
36997,Sheldon,No I mean it. I mean it. It’s like you have the soul of a label maker.
36998,Sheldon,Let me offer you a compromise. Sometimes when I feel stifled and want a change of scenery I use my imagination.
36999,Sheldon,How about dolphins?
37000,Sheldon,Really?
37001,Sheldon,Interrupting physicist.
37002,Leonard,Uh sure. Very… prominent.
37003,Penny,What?
37004,Sheldon,At the bottom. I must say I’m relieved you’re not making more of a scene out of this.
37005,Sheldon,A side of corn succotash. Hmm. Interesting.
37006,Sheldon,There’s no need for compliments this court is only interested in the facts.
37007,Leonard,That’s a trick question right?
37009,Leonard,I’ll start again.
37010,Sheldon,And I’m gonna need you to sign a non-disclosure agreement.
37011,Penny,Am I interrupting.
37012,Penny,Oh better than North Dakota!  I guess that joke’s only funny in Nebraska.
37013,Sheldon,You brought a girl to the Mars Rover control room?
37014,Leonard,I don’t get it I already told her a lie why replace it with a different lie?
37015,Penny,Okay if you’re going to drink on this date just promise me you won’t overdo it.
37016,Penny,What? Oh God yeah. Yeah. Leonard’s a noisy little dude in the sack.
37017,Penny,Why would they lie to us?
37018,Sheldon,It may be low-tech but I still maintain the whoopee cushion has comic validity.
37019,Sheldon,Eh well very well. Oh and on the topic of sharing things that are yours there is a gentleman caller bringing flowers to your fiancée as we speak.
37020,Sheldon,Oh really? Well I grew up with an older brother and a very contentious twin sister and I believe I could easily best you in any physical confrontation be it noogies swirlies or the classic why are you hitting yourself?
37021,Sheldon,Oh of course it’s no big deal to you. You idolize me and nothing could ever knock me off that pedestal you put me on.
37022,Sheldon,Listen Leonard’s mom is a renowned psychiatrist and woman of science. Can you please keep the Bible babble to yourself while she’s here?
37023,Leonard,Well uh okay um I don’t want to get back together with Penny. We tried it it was crazy it didn’t work but I can’t deal with the fact that she slept with my friend Raj. And then I find out that Raj’s sister Priya who I’ve been going out with for eight months is moving back to India. So I’m just completely confused and alone.
37024,Sheldon,You’re embarrassing me right now a grown man worrying about such nonsense when in the middle of flying kites.
37025,Sheldon,Did you see that? He just cut the line.
37026,Howard,Would you like to go with me?
37027,Penny,A whole box.
37028,Howard,So what are we going to do tonight?
37029,Penny,Yeah. We waited a few months. We can wait a few more days.
37030,Leonard,Actually he’s a genius.
37031,Penny,Well then maybe you shouldn’t have named her Wheelchair Kathy.
37032,Howard,I feel like I’ve been called down to the principal’s office. Although I wouldn’t mind if Brown Sugar suspended me. From a sex swing. This may have been a mistake.
37033,Penny,Leonard I bought you this because I wanted you to have fun with it. I don’t want it to just sit in this box.
37034,Leonard,No I’m not.
37035,Howard,I… I do enjoy the La Brea Tar Pits.
37036,Howard,Holy crap!
37037,Howard,Really? I thought they were out West someplace.
37038,Howard,Mmm. Oh cheesecake you’re just as good as a woman even though I can’t have sex with you.
37039,Leonard,Sheldon we haven’t won a game all night. Now you either stick your face in that pie or I’m gonna stick that pie in your face.
37040,Raj,And it’s done.
37041,Leonard,Don’t want people to see what huh? A little bit of this?
37042,Howard,Um okay. First off know that we all love you and cherish you.
37043,Howard,I had pee his pants.
37044,Howard,Thank you. 
37045,Penny,Champagne champagne.
37046,Penny,Sweetie you are grown up.
37047,Leonard,What?
37048,Sheldon,Help! Somebody help!
37049,Howard,Yeah look. Breasts and everything.
37050,Sheldon,Well I shouldn’t be surprised. There’s a rich history of brilliant minds descending into madness.
37051,Raj,Sixty seconds. This is not looking good.
37052,Raj,Aha! So I am working with you.
37053,Sheldon,Leonard please let me go.
37054,Sheldon,Never mind. I clearly woke you up in the middle of a REM cycle you’re in no state to talk.
37055,Sheldon,We could but we always run the risk of someone else beating us to the punch.
37056,Penny,My God how fast were you going?
37057,Penny,With my life.
37058,Penny,No.
37059,Howard,End things? I’m trying to tell you that I love you.
37060,Penny,About twenty.
37061,Penny,Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Oh God just finish the sentence. Okay well I’m sorry you feel that way. Bye. No one wants to hear my apologies.
37062,Sheldon,Unless he takes Bernadette’s last name. And considering her advanced status that could open some doors for him.
37063,Howard,My turn.
37064,Sheldon,I was but Penny didn’t want to. You didn’t want to. Bernadette Amy Koothrappali and Wolowitz didn’t want to. And even I knew it was weird to hire somebody.
37065,Howard,I hope the bathroom is clearly marked.
37066,Sheldon,Like what?
37067,Penny,Ooh yes. Fun.
37068,Penny,Just sit.
37069,Leonard,Alright and Raj.
37070,Sheldon,No I wouldn’t.
37071,Penny,Okay you know what? It’s lame when I say it it’s just ridiculous when you pile on.
37072,Sheldon,Have you had intercourse?
37073,Howard,Oh please?
37074,Leonard,A death ray?
37075,Leonard,I could use the bathroom at 820.
37076,Leonard,Why not.
37077,Penny,That’s probably it. What’d you say to her?
37078,Penny,I’m just not really in the mood anymore.
37079,Leonard,Okay come with me.
37080,Sheldon,Oh excited concerned a little scared. All the same emotions I feel in line at Space Mountain.
37081,Howard,For me it was a bonding moment.
37082,Sheldon,What? Wh where’s the judgment? Wh where’s the fire and brimstone? Where’s the part where you tell us we’re going to Hell and I say have you seen the size of the bugs outside? We’re already there.
37083,Sheldon,Oh please. I admit that spherical chicken joke that was hilarious. But it was straight downhill from there.
37084,Howard,Why the rush? She isn’t going anywhere.
37085,Penny,Wow. You are cute when you get all gangsta. 
37086,Penny,It’s getting kind of cheesy Leonard.
37087,Howard,Let’s do this.
37088,Leonard,Then what do you need?
37089,Raj,No no this is brand new. We haven’t even been on a proper date yet.
37090,Sheldon,All right if no one’s going to guess I was spying the aluminium rims on the police car we passed a few miles back.
37091,Sheldon,You told me not to call and I didn’t know how else to give you the good news. Fun with Flags is back and you can be in the next episode.
37092,Sheldon,Yes that good news.
37093,Leonard,The kid got a girl.
37094,Sheldon,You initialed it. See? L.H. L.H. L.H.
37095,Leonard,No don’t make it so. Barry we can’t fight you tomorrow our engineer is incapacitated.
37096,Leonard,Nope. Now the Lisatronic 3000 just sits in a box waiting for the phone to ring.
37097,Leonard,Oh my God. What happened?
37098,Sheldon,Of course I can. It’s coming back under the residual effects of the anaesthesia that’s the problem. Two years ago after a deep gum cleaning I thought I got on a bus but somehow wound up on a booze cruise to Mexico.
37099,Penny,Sheldon may I ask you a question?
37100,Leonard,Don’t worry this is exactly how you look when you’re dancing in clubs.
37101,Sheldon,Kripke.
37102,Leonard,All right.
37103,Penny,How? Unlike me you have a job. I’m just gonna have to go back to being a waitress like I will be for the rest of my life.
37104,Penny,Oh obviously it’s gonna happen. Yeah a psychic at a bachelorette party told me so. Anyway what I meant was I shouldn’t wait you know? I’ve got you I’ve got Sheldon all these wonderful friends. My life is exciting right now.
37105,Sheldon,They let me blow the whistle Leonard.
37106,Leonard,There was one time I put body glitter on.
37107,Leonard,Get out.
37108,Sheldon,Remind me to compliment Wolowitz on the software it’s amazingly detailed.
37109,Howard,But I never will.
37110,Leonard,Just not against their will.
37111,Leonard,You are not Isaac Newton.
37112,Sheldon,I’m sorry?
37113,Leonard,Lettuce shredded not chopped?
37114,Penny,No no. It’s about my acting career.
37115,Sheldon,Thank you. May I share something with you that’s troubling me?
37117,Sheldon,Yeah so are you.
37118,Howard,It’s funny because bread sounds like dead.
37119,Sheldon,Yeah that was five weeks ago. How much longer is he gonna milk that cow?
37120,Raj,Eh no he’s not going to eat it is he?
37121,Leonard,I quoted your favourite Nsync song.
37122,Sheldon,This is Asian fusion. For all you know there’s a tiny Chihuahua in here.
37123,Sheldon,So with all those antioxidants what if I run out of oxidants?
37124,Howard,They’re not even trying. Remember the Satanimals pack with the Hellephant? Why absurd. What was he a bad elephant who died and went to hell? What could an elephant possibly do that would cause him eternal damnation?
37125,Leonard,Excuse me Amy. Penny do you have plans for dinner tonight?
37126,Leonard,Exactly except you don’t have a lunatic running around yelling I fed you sugar water why are you biting me? Come on this is boring you really want to talk about this?
37127,Leonard,When is it?
37128,Penny,Okay let’s go.
37129,Sheldon,That’s silly. Almost as silly as Dr. Baker having a telephone since telephones only existed in large cities at that time. This is more like Little House on the Preposterous.
37130,Sheldon,Intriguing.
37131,Howard,Uh turn left here and see if he turns with us.
37132,Howard,Go online and look it up.
37133,Raj,He’s right. But in my defence if we could survive that we could survive anything.
37134,Leonard,That’s true.
37135,Penny,Oh. I know what about that bed-and-breakfast?
37136,Raj,No it’s just that everybody’s got someone. Sheldon’s with Amy Howard’s getting married you’re dating my sister.
37137,Leonard,Oh how many times do I have to say it? I support you.
37138,Raj,Come on let’s get a drink.
37139,Penny,Did you bring enough inhalers?
37140,Raj,And doesn’t require outside machinery to be built to access it.
37141,Sheldon,Hey you broke up with me. It is none of your business whose naked bosom I’m smooshing around like pizza dough.
37142,Sheldon, Leonard?
37143,Penny,Who elected you Road Trip God?
37144,Raj,Really smart guy? Where’s he supposed to park his sweet little Corvette?
37145,Leonard,Yeah my parents felt that naming me Leonard and putting me in advanced placement classes wasn’t getting me beaten up enough.
37146,Penny,Still saying stupid stuff. Ooh does she like bracelets?
37147,Sheldon,The fact is I’m quite close to a breakthrough in showing how neutrinos emerge from a string-net condensate.
37148,Howard,Wool pants in the desert. I feel like I’ve got poached testicles.
37149,Leonard,Well then let’s un-pause it.
37150,Leonard,What was what?
37152,Leonard,That’s all very comforting but if it’s okay I’d like to get on with my question now.
37153,Raj,Shame on all of you.
37154,Howard,I like to boogie.
37155,Leonard,Don’t.
37156,Raj,I almost met someone last night but I blew it. I was walking Cinnamon and this girl introduced herself but she was so cute I panicked and said wouldn’t it be easier if instead of talking we could just sniff each other’s butts?
37157,Sheldon,Based on the glowing reception of our recent Behind the Flags retrospective we thought you might like to see how it all came together.
37158,Penny,Yeah.
37159,Howard,My friends told me it was okay to see more than one person at a time but it it feels like I’m being deceitful.
37160,Raj,Every night.
37161,Leonard,Well thanks. And I don’t want you to be stuck at a job you don’t like.
37162,Sheldon,Oh I see a space in the white zone. Quick circle the airport.
37163,Howard,Whoa. Just trying to help.
37164,Leonard,I don’t know what to tell you but they’re on sale.
37165,Penny,Well then don’t order popcorn.
37166,Penny,Damn.
37167,Leonard,Sheldon?  What are you doing?!
37168,Penny,Really? Is that how you talk to your mother?
37169,Sheldon,It’s not about you. It’s about a poor immigrant from Pakistan trying to make his way in America by working the graveyard shift at the Colorado Boulevard Chevron.
37170,Penny,Oh I see?
37171,Sheldon,Well if it’s part of the prom experience then I’m open to it.
37172,Sheldon,Thanks. Oh. Great party.
37173,Leonard,It can be. Confetti fight. Maybe you should take a break. I got this.
37174,Penny,Okay I’ll I’ll go. Howard and Bernadette I know you two planned on getting married in a big fancy wedding but when you’re in love it doesn’t matter where or how these things happen. It just matters that you have each other.
37175,Howard,It looks like a map from Dungeons and Dragons.
37176,Raj,Yeah it was first come first served.
37177,Leonard,And what?
37178,Penny,Really good.
37179,Howard,Yeah.
37180,Howard,What just happened?
37181,Sheldon,When you play Chutes and Ladders do you complain about all the chutes and all the ladders?
37182,Sheldon,Man is not the only species that ferments fruit in order to become intoxicated. Can you guess what the other is? Hint sometimes they pack the alcohol in their trunks.
37183,Penny,Come on let’s go.
37184,Leonard,What are you going to do when you get to the university? People are going to recognize you.
37185,Penny,I don’t know how Leonard can get so caught up in this.
37186,Leonard,Okay look no Penny I think what you’re feeling is perfectly valid and maybe a little bit later today when you’re feeling a little bit less for lack of a better word violated maybe we could talk about this some more.
37187,Sheldon,Biologically speaking Howard is perfectly justified in seeking out the optimum mate for the propagation of his genetic line.
37188,Howard,Okay uh will I get to see you tomorrow?
37189,Sheldon,Well excuse me. That was not a betrayal that was an experiment to determine at what concentration food starts tasting mothy.
37190,Leonard,She completely understood everything I said. Case closed.
37191,Penny,So did you at least get Sheldon’s fake stuff back?
37192,Sheldon,And if anyone were to actually call that number they will hear this.
37193,Sheldon,Oh of course you would have to believe that. Evil always thinks it’s doing right. Excuse me Stormtrooper. These are the droids you’re looking for.
37194,Sheldon,On oatmeal day?
37195,Sheldon,I expected to see Howard throw the baseball finish my hot dog and hightail it across the street to Disneyland just in time for Mickey’s Soundsational Parade.
37196,Sheldon,Can I make you a cup of tea?
37197,Penny,Uh hello.
37198,Penny,Translation?
37199,Leonard,‘Cause he’s upset over his situation with Penny and if I have to hear about it again I’m going to kick him in his ovaries.
37200,Leonard,I’m doing okay I guess.
37201,Leonard,Where did you get that?
37202,Howard,What is your move?
37203,Penny,There’s absolutely no difference.
37204,Penny,Okay. What artificial satellite has seen glimpses of Einsteins predicted frame dragging? 
37205,Leonard,Yes you are.
37206,Sheldon,I’m Batman. Shhhhh!
37207,Sheldon,Obviously another carnal fiasco with the shiksi goddess.
37208,Sheldon,I’m ready to go.
37209,Sheldon,Oh I guess I was wrong.
37210,Leonard,Penny wait. Aagh! What is wrong with you?
37211,Penny,Well I cut back my expenses like you said and picked up a few more hours at the restaurant but the biggest thing was out of the blue Kurt shows up and gives me the money he owes me.
37212,Howard,Oh. I always thought that was some sort of after-Christmas sale. Well then why don’t we just go to the galleria and walk around?
37213,Sheldon,I’m sorry Leonard. It’s too early to discount the possibility of this being an inside job.
37214,Sheldon,Don’t try and trick me into buying something I don’t want. Now let’s talk Aquaman.
37215,Sheldon,All right. I thought the candy might not be enough so let me up the ante. These are Cooper Coupons. These are for various things I can do for you. Um oh this one is for one free grammar check. Uh you could use it for emails letters tattoos what have you. Um oh this is fun one. This is an afternoon with me at the California Science Center where I point out their mistakes.
37216,Leonard,You didn’t do anything it’s Sheldon. That’d make a nice needlepoint pillow.
37217,Penny,Oh my God. That’s the most romantic thing anyone’s ever said to me that I didn’t understand.
37218,Penny,Okay I’m sorry what exactly happened?
37219,Sheldon,That was a lot of puppies.
37220,Raj,It’s possible she may have misunderstood us.
37221,Penny,Hey you don’t need Leonard and his app. You can make one with me.
37222,Penny,It’s getting creepy again.
37223,Howard,He’s got to be doing this on purpose.
37224,Leonard,Yeah um so hey speaking of money how are you feeling about helping the physics department get a cryogenic centrifugal pump and molecular sieve?
37225,Leonard,All right fine. So you want to get back together with her but you’re too ashamed to face her because of whatever it is you did.
37226,Penny,Mmm what smells so good?
37227,Raj,No. We can do this by ourselves.
37228,Raj,I must be strong so I don’t stray from my true purpose the study of the universe.
37229,Penny,Yeah yeah I know.
37230,Sheldon,You’ve asked me to lie on your behalf and as you know I am deeply uncomfortable with impromptu dishonest so I’ve provided you with an iron clad alibi. You couldn’t have spent last night with Priya because you were with another woman.
37231,Howard,No spoilers. No spoilers.
37232,Penny,All right. So um just give me a call.
37233,Leonard,Why not? People do things right now all the time. Why can’t we be right now people too. Go home pack a bag and we’ll be right now people. I have to stop at the drug store to refill a prescription but after that we’ll go right now.
37234,Leonard,Well maybe we have lost our focus.
37236,Howard,Sheldon stop being a baby and let Emily take a look at you.
37237,Raj,No. I I have no idea. What would you do?
37238,Penny,What?
37239,Sheldon,I kiss you back on the  lips as well. Your turn.
37240,Sheldon,If the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimetres most people will trip.
37241,Leonard,Ah. Well I guess for you guys that’s like regular golf.
37242,Leonard,I thought you were gonna pretend to be an alien.
37243,Sheldon,All right.
37244,Howard,Why didn’t girls like us in high school?
37245,Sheldon,In brightest day in darkest night no evil shall escape my sight.
37246,Penny,Oh.
37247,Howard,Wait your your mother is sleeping with your dentist?
37248,Penny,What about the girl behind the counter?
37250,Leonard,Good. Because I’ve loved you since the moment we met and I will keep loving you until the end of time.
37251,Raj,Like really a million?
37252,Sheldon,Oh speaking of personal growth I recently tried eating Swiss chard. You know I didn’t swallow it but Amy said it counted.
37253,Raj,Oh uh let me try. Uh channelis changeroni. This might be my second favorite brown magic wand.
37254,Howard,Wait. You’re sure they’re Star Wars tickets?
37255,Leonard,Go on.
37256,Leonard,Oh congratulations what a lucky break.
37257,Howard,Got him. When Gandhi advocated his philosophy of non-violence I bet he didn’t know how much fun it was killing stuff.
37258,Raj,I don’t know. This old pen kind of proves gravity. When I tilt it her bathing suit falls right off.
37259,Sheldon,I feel very comfortable around you.
37260,Leonard,For all the crappy stuff you did to me in high school.
37261,Leonard,We all make mistakes let’s move on.
37262,Howard,Yeah but why are you fat?
37263,Sheldon,I am terrified of stepping on a nail and falling into a butt crack.
37264,Leonard,Are you sure? That doesn’t sound right.
37265,Penny,So Dan you have a grandson. How old is he?
37266,Sheldon,What are you doing?
37267,Leonard,What happened to you?
37268,Sheldon,Did you once again ignore your check engine light?
37269,Leonard,What about it?
37270,Raj,Oh yes we’ve got the moon and the trees and Elizabeth McNulty who apparently died when she was the same age I am.
37271,Penny,That would really piss me off if I didn’t have a buzz going on.
37272,Leonard,We are entering the physics bowl and we need a fourth for our team.
37273,Howard,But remember our agreement? You can joke about murdering people but you have to say just kidding.
37274,Sheldon,Understandable but there’s a universality to that story which transcends ethnicity.
37275,Raj,So don’t do it.
37276,Penny,Sheldon it’s fine.
37277,Penny,If I had more than a box of baking soda in my refrigerator I wouldn’t have to take that.
37278,Leonard,Are you guys drunk?
37279,Sheldon,The part where I tell you I’ve engineered a rematch with Stuart’s team for tonight.
37280,Leonard,Hey we brought you Thai. Where is everything?
37281,Sheldon,That’s nice. Now in German.
37282,Sheldon,There is ominous music playing and there is an afghan over my head. I don’t know where you’re from but where I’m from that means I’m not doing okay.
37283,Leonard,You don’t sound very excited about it.
37284,Leonard,What are you doing?
37285,Howard,Thanks for the lift.
37286,Howard,No no. I will take care of it.
37287,Penny,Oh Sheldon please look I’m asking you as a friend.
37288,Penny,I told you things would change if you plucked your eyebrows.
37289,Leonard,Oh hey babe I think I figured this thing out.
37290,Leonard,Well now hold on. What kind of distance are we talking about? Because we are neighbours. I mean I can hear the toilet flush in your apartment.
37291,Leonard,Slow down. Two hundred.
37292,Sheldon,Blue Icees and a trip to The Container Store? It’s like I died and went to the post-mortem neuron-induced hallucination commonly mistaken as heaven.
37293,Penny,Why wouldn’t you?
37294,Penny,It’s fine it’s been on for like a month.
37295,Penny,Yes but once in a while people think you’re a little mean.
37296,Howard,Oh come on you can’t say oh my and then not tell me.
37297,Howard,Cheers.
37298,Leonard,Yes you will and she’ll be beautiful and kind and sexy and funny and everything you ever wanted in a woman.
37299,Howard,Oh come on you know you want to say it. Say it. Say you love him. Say it!
37300,Penny,No. I’m serious.
37301,Leonard,You tried to lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords?
37302,Howard,If this was Star Trek we could use a phaser to blast it off.
37303,Penny,I really thought Mike was different I thought he was sensitive and smart. I mean not you smart normal non-freaky smart.
37304,Sheldon,Home from work? What time is it?
37305,Sheldon,Oh terrific now we’re running a cute little B&B.
37306,Sheldon,Oh sure you do. Now see what’s this here in the schematic is that a laser array?
37307,Howard,Thank you Howard.
37308,Leonard,Okay what’s wrong with it?
37309,Sheldon,Priya if you’re experiencing any tension or awkwardness it may stem from the fact that Leonard and Penny used to if I may quote Howard do the dance with no pants.
37310,Penny,I wouldn’t exactly call Star Trek embarrassing.
37311,Sheldon,There is no class.
37312,Leonard,No. Why?
37313,Raj,What else are you gonna do with it? Put it in your coffee?
37314,Sheldon,Glad you asked. As I see it there’s a simple solution. Your lips had a dalliance with the lips of another woman. It seems only logical that to restore balance to the relationship you should find another man and dally with him. And by dally I mean some hardcore mouth-on-mouth action.
37315,Sheldon,You’re happy with who you are. You don’t get jealous of other people. Instead of being weighed down by ambition you just float along like a dead body in a river.
37316,Raj,Sounds like a lot of work.
37317,Sheldon,I believe our nation’s tuna cans are safe. Excuse me. Dr. Greene question?
37318,Raj,We’re good.
37319,Leonard,So humiliating? Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory…? I’m sorry. I’ll. I’ll stop. I’ll stop.
37320,Penny,Leonard why are you making such a big deal out of this? So our roles have changed a bit over the last couple years. This is the way life is. And I’m sure in time they’ll change again.
37322,Leonard,No it’s a drinking game. Whenever we see an iceberg we take a shot!
37323,Sheldon,Well the instructions are very clear don’t feed the gremlins after midnight don’t get the gremlins wet. How hard is that?
37324,Raj,No rush no rush.
37325,Howard,She and I were supposed to watch the new Avengers movie tonight but it was sold out. So I said what else do you want to do? She said let’s go to a cemetery and do it on somebody’s grave.
37326,Sheldon,That doesn’t seem likely. Her bed’s of sturdy construction. Even the addition
37327,Raj,hat time should I be at your mother’s?
37328,Raj,How are you gonna get James Earl Jones?
37329,Leonard,That’s not where it was going.
37330,Penny,Okay. Whatever look my company does not allow me to socialize with doctors outside of work. You got to get rid of him.
37331,Howard,Sheldon you know what I think of when I’m scared? Voyager.
37332,Howard,Yes.
37333,Leonard,Uh sure.
37334,Penny,Good night. You know maybe it wouldn’t be the worst idea in the world to violate the Neutral Zone for just one night. Oh!
37335,Sheldon,I’m confused. You’re always saying that you want to spend more time with me.
37336,Penny,Really? You couldn’t get it out?
37337,Penny,I’m nosy. See ya.
37338,Penny,Yeah.
37339,Leonard,Relax it’s a hard puzzle. It’s gonna take a while to solve.
37340,Sheldon,Really?
37341,Penny,Yes. Don’t take your shirt off just because the director said so.
37342,Raj,It’s a little hard to see with the city lights but that W-shaped constellation is Cassiopeia. And she was the mother of Andromeda who’s over there.
37343,Leonard,Because you don’t know how to do cryptanalysis do you?
37344,Penny,Give my friend his stuff back.
37345,Sheldon,No.
37346,Penny,Ugh!
37347,Leonard,‘Cause when you talk it enrages people.
37348,Raj,Ugh let’s get this over with.
37349,Sheldon,So my path to satisfaction is blocked by lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants. Very well. They must be destroyed.
37350,Leonard,If you don’t mind waiting for a Groupon we can try marriage counselling.
37351,Howard,Thank you.
37352,Howard,I’m telling you Leonard video slot machines free drinks brought to us by a bosomy barmaid and all you can eat shrimp for $3.95. Disneyland can suck it. This is the real happiest place on earth.
37353,Penny,Um…
37354,Sheldon,Hey I hate to break up the party but Amy says I’m tired and have to go to bed.
37355,Raj,Make way for the fastest man alive.  Oh no!
37356,Penny,I never thought about it like that.
37357,Sheldon,I know. What an elf I would have made. Whoo what do you think you’re doing?
37358,Leonard,Oh Thursday’s gone. Just Sunday left.
37359,Sheldon,Leonard I am overwhelmed. Everything is changing and it’s simply too much. I need to get away and think.
37360,Howard,Come on think back. It would really help if you had.
37361,Raj,No. But if you catch anything I know how to steam it in banana leaves.
37362,Penny,You nailed it.
37363,Sheldon,So what prescription are you getting filled?
37364,Leonard,So I’ve been thinking about the hover boards and maybe there’s a way we could use Maglev technology.
37365,Raj,Yeah of course. What else could it be? Boy do I love America.
37366,Penny,Okay now this time try drinking it all at once.
37367,Sheldon,It is. They’re what hold back the urine and the faeces. Look maybe maybe you shouldn’t read it. It’ll only make you feel worse.
37368,Leonard,It’s blackmail!
37369,Sheldon,I really don’t understand what you’re so unhappy about you begged me to come I came there’s just no pleasing you.
37370,Sheldon,Good idea. Attention is what birds want.  Make a pot of tea Leonard. It’s going to be a long night.
37371,Howard,Attention all shoppers my business is open for business!
37372,Penny,Uh we’re not counting this as a date are we?
37373,Sheldon,I suppose that’s a fair request. There’s no reason we both can’t benefit from this experience.
37374,Sheldon,All right.
37375,Leonard,No.
37376,Howard,Who else could it be? It has to be Eddie Crispo.
37377,Sheldon,Oh no there are no kids. No the the show’s for me. Come on. I’ll race ya Arthur.
37378,Sheldon,Literally? Literally a million years?
37379,Leonard,What was your first clue?
37380,Howard,Couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy.
37381,Raj,He’s right.
37382,Raj,I’ll see you around.
37383,Leonard,For all I knew he was the crazy one. He had this really deranged look.
37384,Penny,All right. You guys ready to get crazy?
37385,Leonard,I’m putting all this stuff in storage. We don’t need any of it.
37386,Penny,Fine. Go ahead. 
37387,Leonard,Don’t panic this is what the last 97 hours have been about.
37388,Howard,Fine. Tell her I have a deep sexy voice like James Earl Jones.
37389,Sheldon,As a symbolic gesture to all the bullies who’ve tormented us for years we open our home to Jimmy and once he’s asleep we kill him. I said it would be nice I didn’t say we should do it.
37390,Howard,Amy.
37391,Sheldon,Well I said a chance you know. When you tell them it’s your birthday at Bennigan’s they make a fuss. I don’t see why the Philharmonic would be any different.
37392,Sheldon,I’ve been thinking about Dr. Greene’s efforts to make science palatable for the masses.
37393,Penny,It’s not over is it?
37394,Raj,Three.
37395,Leonard,I don’t even know what you’re talking about and I agree.
37396,Leonard,I was wrong there’s three excuses for that.
37397,Penny,Well sickly is the new sexy.
37398,Leonard,Why are you crouching there?
37399,Sheldon,Fine. Good night to you sir. Miss.
37400,Leonard,Then I’m going to tell him we’re in.
37401,Raj,Okay here’s the deal six months ago my research testing the predicted composition of trans-Neptunian objects ran into a dead end.
37402,Sheldon,Counter-proposal. We reinstate the full roommate agreement with the following addendum in the spirit of Mother’s Day or Father’s Day once a year we set aside day to celebrate all your contributions to my life both actual and imagined by you. We could call it Leonard’s Day.
37403,Sheldon,Wait a minute. I know this may sound far fetched but I’m on the market now. You know if I dated Mandy that would teach both Leonard and Amy a lesson.
37404,Leonard,Actually I read somewhere that it’s one of the most popular programmes in India.
37405,Penny,I mean do you know where I was all morning? Auditioning with 50 other blondes for some stupid antidepressant commercial. And for what? So I’ll finally get my daddy’s approval?
37406,Sheldon,There’s no denying I have feelings for you that can’t be explained in any other way. I briefly considered that I had a brain parasite. But that seems even more farfetched. The only conclusion was love. I know what’s happening. This is a panic attack. SoccerMom09 says to lie down with your feet elevated.
37407,Penny,Uh we’re not sure. But I want to wait long enough to prove to my mother I’m not pregnant.
37408,Sheldon,Oh James I could listen to your stories all night.
37409,Sheldon,If you’re compiling a mix CD for a double suicide.  Oh I hope that scratching post is for you.
37410,Sheldon,Guess.
37411,Sheldon,Amy why don’t you look excited? Well you get to watch me play with this.
37412,Leonard,So what kind of things are they…  will you stop that?
37413,Leonard,Mm Sheldon you didn’t have a personality you just had some shows you liked.
37414,Leonard,If you don’t come out of there I’m going to have to drag you out.
37415,Sheldon,It just occurred to me that I never formally congratulated you on your pending nuptials. So I hopped on the first bus and hightailed it down here to shake your hand. Put ‘er there you old so-and-so.
37416,Raj,Yes but I’m finding that having a lackey suits me.
37417,Sheldon,Right.
37418,Sheldon,Ah-ah-ah he’s a geologist and I have more physics jokes.
37419,Sheldon,What’s wrong?
37420,Penny,Yippee it’s backwards. I get it.
37421,Leonard,Yeah?
37422,Howard,What? The the guy who plays Jon Snow was a jerk. We still watch Game of Thrones.
37423,Leonard,Yes sir.
37424,Sheldon,Simple. If she were to log on to www.socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other click on upcoming events scroll down to seminars download the pdf schedule and look for the seminar on molecular positronium well then bippidy-boppidy-boo our pants are metaphorically on fire.
37425,Sheldon,I did not think of that. Clearly febrile delirium is setting in please bring me some soup while I still understand what a spoon is for.
37426,Penny,Yeah I didn’t stay for the detention I’m not gonna read the report card.
37427,Leonard,I don’t know. What’s the difference?
37428,Sheldon,Okay get this. It doesn’t matter if he’s showering her with gifts because the Koothrappalis are vastly wealthy.
37429,Raj,Yes?
37430,Penny,Wow.
37431,Leonard,Oh hey buddy.
37432,Raj,Answer it.
37433,Raj,I don’t know about you but I feel empowered.
37434,Sheldon,You don’t need him. I’ll represent you.
37435,Leonard,We’re not going to give up just like that.
37436,Penny,I don’t know. Somewhere in L.A.
37437,Raj,I’m gonna all alone on Valentine’s Day.
37438,Sheldon,Well I can be helpful. Give me something to do. You know my father took me to work once and in ten minutes I figured out who’d been stealing from the cash register. It was my father. Yeah Dad lost his job but Mr. Hinckley gave me a Fudgsicle.
37439,Sheldon,No see? Well you absolutely would not. And furthermore the Xbox One now comes with a Kinect included.
37440,Penny,I love your little heart locket Bernadette.
37441,Howard,Oh right uh girlfriend. Okay.
37442,Raj,I’m a lamb.
37443,Penny,How can I calm down? I’m gonna lose my whole shopping cart. That’s three hours of picking out shoes just shot to hell.
37444,Penny,How about we just talk?
37445,Raj,Why don’t we take him to see the Blue Man Group?
37447,Leonard,And you had to barge in here and wake us up in the middle of the night?
37448,Sheldon,The coefficient isn’t lambda it’s lambda sub one. And over here you should consider the possibility that the brain itself is in two different quantum states. And lastly do you have any little soup crackers?
37450,Sheldon,No! Leonard let me tell you something. Personal robots cannot get here soon enough.
37451,Penny,We were worried about you.
37453,Raj,Has it occurred to you you’re missing the big picture? If you look at neutron scattering data…
37454,Penny,Um I never really thought about it. Why?
37455,Sheldon,Well I doubt they’d want to talk about that so we’re fine.
37456,Sheldon,Fifteen years old. Dennis Kim is fifteen years old and he’s already correcting my work. Today I went from being Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to… you know that other guy.
37457,Sheldon,Yes. But not as good as I’m going to when I tell you that your precious Garfield has no reason to hate Mondays. He’s a cat. He doesn’t have a job.
37458,Leonard,Look everything went fine. I didn’t even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starters. The woman across the hall is into me.
37459,Sheldon,I’m being awful? You’re the one who went out of your way to hurt me.
37460,Leonard,That’s weird.
37461,Penny,Sheldon do you hear that? I mean Amy is the key to your happiness.
37462,Sheldon,At the last department party Dr Finkleday cornered me and talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.
37463,Howard,I’m actually glad Lucy had to work tonight. Saved me the awkward conversation about how I was gonna be hanging with my bros.
37464,Sheldon,Wait just to clarify. When you get to three do we stand up or do we pee?
37465,Sheldon,It’s my idea of what DNA would look like in a silicon based life form.
37466,Sheldon,Oh you want me to share credit?
37467,Raj,Don’t flatter yourself dude. I want to go out and meet a woman.
37468,Penny,What?
37469,Leonard,Okay yeah. What do we have to lose? I’m a little nervous.
37470,Leonard,No she’s not.
37471,Leonard,Okay.
37472,Howard,Me too.
37473,Sheldon,It’s too late. I call dibs.
37474,Howard,How did you get it?
37475,Leonard,This is the movie that big soda doesn’t want you to see.
37476,Raj,As with my father I both love and fear it.
37477,Sheldon,So?
37478,Sheldon,Oh! Good point Amy. Yeah building on your premise Leonard could frequent sushi bars salad bars oyster bars the Apple Genius Bar what are you doing?
37479,Leonard,Mm-hmm. Well I would like to propose a toast to a well-deserved weekend of…
37480,Leonard,how could I be mad? You actually risked your life because you cared about me.
37481,Raj,And we still don’t know who framed him.
37482,Leonard,You have fun. I will not be attending.
37483,Sheldon,Is it? Just a moment ago I had a minor epiphany regarding the polymer degradation phenomenon while scraping congealed nachos off a plate. Bernadette table 10 wants their check.
37484,Howard,Maybe you’re right.
37485,Raj,He’s got a point.
37486,Raj,Hey remember The Ark of the Covenant?
37487,Leonard,Terrific. My-my point is you need to face up to what you’re feeling with this breakup.
37488,Penny,Okay look. Howard I just want to apologize for some things that I have said. About you. I’ve been informed that you have feelings. And apparently I have hurt them. So I’m sorry. Howard.
37489,Sheldon,Oh. That is an engagement ring that I was going to give my girlfriend Amy.
37490,Raj,Your next puzzle is a riddle. And who better to give it to you than The Riddler?
37491,Leonard,What would I even say?
37492,Sheldon,No that seemed a little farfetched.
37493,Leonard,Howard you talk to him. Howard? You’re peeing aren’t you?
37494,Raj,Ah yes online gaming addiction. There’s nothing worse than having that multi-player monkey on your back.
37495,Raj,Well to be honest Leonard’s on the other line and he offered me their spare bedroom.
37496,Raj,So that’s it? Everything’s sold out?
37497,Raj,Forget the mission how did that little yutz get a girl on his own?
37498,Sheldon,I didn’t put on my come-hither plaid PJ’s for nothing.
37499,Leonard,Maybe you need a fresh start.
37500,Leonard,You hid behind a tree yelling “get the kid in the yarmulkah get the kid in the yarmulkah.”
37501,Penny,Maybe.
37502,Sheldon,I would like to change mine. The pirate’s name was Peg-Leg Antoine. Now it’s completely different from Goonies.
37503,Leonard,Well they don’t. Hard as it may be for you to believe most people don’t sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fibre content.
37504,Leonard,Look uh Joy it was nice to meet you but…
37505,Howard,I didn’t pick up on that. That’s a nice touch.
37506,Howard,What?
37507,Howard,Wh what happened?
37508,Sheldon,I’m sorry. What pun?
37509,Raj,It’s even got the Elvish engraving on it.
37510,Leonard,Sheldon don’t ruin the game.
37511,Sheldon,No one ever does. That’s why it happens.
37512,Howard,Well thanks Bernadette. And just for the record labradoodles are hypo-allergenic which is a very sexy quality to those troubled by animal dander.
37513,Penny,Sorry just remembered I’ve got to stop by the drugstore.
37514,Sheldon,Think of me when you apply it.
37515,Penny,Oh just my parents and my entire family.
37516,Penny,Good night Leonard.
37517,Raj,Ooh ooh I forgot about Princess Bride. That’s my answer.
37518,Leonard,Davy Crockett. Jiminy Crockett was a cricket.
37519,Leonard,Hmm. Maybe. Or maybe I tried to do something nice and maybe you had a problem with it because of your control issues.
37520,Penny,Okay you know what? Forget it. I’m not giving you a present.
37521,Leonard,What are we gonna tell the girls?
37522,Sheldon,So it’s settled we’re not doing it.
37523,Sheldon,That’s a great idea. And in the spirit of our new arrangement I will mask my surprise that you came up with it.
37524,Sheldon,Yet another child left behind.
37525,Sheldon,I can do both. My brain is working at optimal capacity. I can have a conversation with you and solve the dark matter proton decay problem at the same time.
37526,Leonard,Oh gee Sheldon I don’t think we can play on Sunday.
37527,Leonard,It’s just an earworm. It’ll come to you.
37528,Penny,What do you tell him?
37529,Leonard,Mmm what if we go as The Fantastic Four and just tell people that the Invisible Girl is standing there with us.
37530,Leonard,Hey check it out it’s just corn starch and water.
37531,Raj,No. No pretty girls. The point is to talk to regular people and work our way up to pretty girls.
37532,Penny,Aw.
37533,Howard,We’re going to be fine.
37534,Sheldon,That’s my spot.
37535,Raj,Right now Howard’s staring down at our planet like a tiny Jewish Greek god. Zeusowitz.
37536,Penny,Well a relationship is more complicated than a French fry.
37537,Leonard,No no no come on in. I’ll make you a cup of coffee.
37538,Sheldon,Thank you.
37539,Leonard,Hmm Priya’s not back yet? Well I guess that’s not unusual women men the whole sitting standing deal so what are we talking about?
37540,Sheldon,I’m not accepting the award.
37541,Sheldon,How many dates have you been on? Who were they with? Where’d you go? Where did you meet them? Did you sleep with them? And how much longer to the aquarium? I’m getting kind of hungry.
37542,Sheldon,You know there was a time when Comic-Con didn’t exist at all until one lone dreamer with a unique vision made it happen. And you mark my words I’m gonna rip that guy off.
37543,Leonard,Well you cook for me all the time and ugh.
37544,Sheldon,Yes it’s a robot uprising. Call the police.
37545,Leonard,And I got itchy and swollen just watching you.
37546,Penny,Um okay. Tell Bernadette to tell Priya that I’m on my way to Prague to shoot a movie with Angelina Jolie.
37547,Sheldon,No. No. No. This is Tondelaya della Ventimiglia.
37548,Sheldon,Why of course it’s what I want. Why would I say it’s what I want if it’s not what I want?
37549,Howard,What about you Sheldon? Do you have any plans tonight?
37550,Sheldon,Oh I’m just happy I don’t know what this memory foam remembers.
37551,Raj,I’m sad.
37552,Penny,Here have some pizza sweetie.
37553,Howard,Go away. 
37554,Howard,Sorry Mommy Papa but with all due respect I really can’t go through…
37555,Leonard,You forbid it?
37556,Penny,You win.
37557,Raj,Couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy.
37558,Penny,No I know I… I know what you meant it’s just… it’s only our first date.
37559,Penny,I don’t know. We could get married.
37560,Sheldon,You know one who was drummed off the force because he refused to play by the rules and now he hires himself out to impose his own brand of rough justice?
37561,Penny,What does that mean?
37563,Sheldon,Of course it is. It’s the perfect gift. How are you feeling right now? Guilty? Sad? Wishing you were Jewish?
37564,Sheldon,I’m Kermit. You’re Scooter.
37565,Sheldon,Excuse me are you Professor Crawley?
37566,Sheldon,I’m reverse engineering Wolowitz’s magic trick.
37567,Leonard,Ignore him. Yeah sorry about the breakup.
37568,Leonard,Maybe but you also think nine minutes isn’t a while so what do you know?
37569,Penny,Okay I’ve got another question. When does this get fun?
37570,Sheldon,So we multiply 193 minus 21 men before the loss of virginity so 172 times 0.18 gives us 30.96 sexual partners. Let’s round that up to 31.
37571,Sheldon,My aunt and uncle were married 63 years. Towards the end it was like watching cheese melt.
37572,Sheldon,Are you ill?
37573,Sheldon,I wanted to apologize for my behaviour today. It it was unnecessary. This is warm. Oh and also I am willing to forego the bathroom schedule.
37574,Sheldon,Why? So you can see the look on Amy’s face when she hears my top-notch idea?
37575,Sheldon,And that reminds me of another saying. You can lead a chicken to Crisco but you can’tmake your mother fry it.
37576,Raj,Howard I’m so sorry your blood pressure was off the charts.
37577,Leonard,I’m sure Mrs. Florida’s walking funny. Can we get back to work?
37578,Sheldon,You didn’t mention Leonard.
37579,Leonard,Yeah. I loved it. Love you love the hair would love to change the subject.
37580,Leonard,Uh rash that’s a bad rash.
37581,Sheldon,Und dis is Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun…
37582,Leonard,Fine Mom. How are you?
37583,Raj,The dating site matched a woman with Sheldon.
37584,Sheldon,Penny hello.
37585,Raj,Maybe we should post a comment back to our fan and thank him.
37586,Leonard,Look I like Leslie but she’s not interested in dating as much as using men as tools for stress release.
37587,Leonard,Sheldon I know you’re in the zone but do you want some tea? All right I can’t believe I’m gonna say this but you haven’t spoken in hours and I’m starting to get worried. Please say something.
37588,Penny,I think you’re too late.
37589,Sheldon,I have gotten much better at that.
37590,Leonard,If it’s half as much fun as One Times Ten to the Fourth Bottles of Beer on the Wall I’m in.
37591,Sheldon,Well yeah okay sure. But which one?
37592,Sheldon,It’s more than that. It’s me. I always knew I had trouble recognizing other people’s emotions but that machine just made it so real.
37593,Leonard,Um I’m not sure.
37594,Penny,Oh okay whatever. Will you please just play along until my dad leaves?
37595,Leonard,Uh could I talk to you in the hall for a sec?
37596,Penny,You’re a brain scientist. Can you explain to me why a brilliant man likes playing with toy trains?
37597,Leonard,You’d do the dolphins.
37598,Leonard,You know what? Never mind. We gave it a shot. Let’s just see what else is on.
37599,Howard,Thank you.
37600,Sheldon,Hey.
37601,Raj,Don’t ruin it for me man. I printed out a PDF to read on the potty.
37602,Sheldon,Um…
37603,Penny,Really?
37604,Sheldon,That’s not apropos. We’ve already established I’m found in the periodic table.
37605,Sheldon,I should’ve picked hickey.
37606,Leonard,Fine. What I did was wrong.
37607,Penny,I feel like I want to cry.
37608,Leonard,Mm-hmm. And?
37609,Leonard,I had no choice. He kept kicking the back of my seat.
37610,Sheldon,Very well. Hey later we’ll check out the minibar I’ll show you how Godzilla gets drunk.
37611,Raj,Of course. Mrs. Cooper. So nice to see you again.
37612,Penny,Great.
37613,Raj,Okay. Okay you’re right. It’s time for me to step up and take responsibility for my life. Be a man.  Hello Mummy.
37614,Sheldon,Yes.
37615,Howard,Here you go.
37616,Sheldon,It doesn’t need proving.
37617,Sheldon,I panicked. He looked taller than usual.
37618,Penny,Yeah so how many people listen?
37619,Sheldon,It was. Bernadette had her baby I made it to Wizarding World and now it is time to complete your birthday celebration. Hankius pankius.
37620,Sheldon,The papers could have been mailed Mom just sent you here to spy on me didn’t she.
37621,Howard,Excuse me.
37622,Penny,Wow it sounds like you’re having a good time.
37623,Leonard,Really? Sex last night pancakes this morning am I dying?
37624,Leonard,He’s got Amy now.
37625,Penny,Thank you. Where’s Sheldon?
37627,Leonard,Could you tell us?
37628,Sheldon,Amy pointed out to me that since you did something nice for me I’m obligated to do something nice for you. So yes I’ll go to your dopey play.
37629,Raj,That’s nothing dude. Go check out how hung Florida is.
37630,Leonard,That’s the part you have a problem with?
37631,Penny,This is great. What’s the occasion?
37632,Penny,That’s right. On my paper. Not yours mine you punk-ass elf.
37633,Penny,Well I can’t read people’s minds. Actually that’s not true I can read men’s minds but only ’cause it’s usually the one thing.
37634,Sheldon,Do you want some cereal. I’m feeling so good today I’m going to choose from the low fibre end of the shelf. Hello Honey Puffs.
37635,Sheldon,What about the cream cheese frosting.
37636,Sheldon,Are you going to be sarcastic?
37637,Sheldon,Red is angry yellow is frightened green is jealous and blue is depressed. Perhaps we can assign a colour to lonely.
37638,Leonard,Now we’ll be able to see the beam when it leaves but it won’t be strong enough when it comes back to be seen by the naked eye.
37639,Howard,We could eat after the movie.
37640,Sheldon,Thank you. Raj keep an eye out for the other one.
37641,Howard,Thanks. Oh Sheldon since Amy’s out of town would you like to join us?
37642,Sheldon,It’s all right Alex. I’m not mad at you I’m just disappointed.
37643,Sheldon,Attaboy!
37644,Howard,The cosmological physicist from Princeton?
37645,Sheldon,Really? ‘Cause every time I come in here I think less of me.
37646,Penny,Oh no thanks. I’m from Nebraska. When we shoot things it’s because we want to eat them or make them leave our boyfriends alone. 
37647,Penny,Yeah we do game nights and video game nights and we watch movies with director’s commentary.
37648,Sheldon,I didn’t invent them they’re there.
37649,Leonard,Of course I don’t want you to be unhappy but I also want you to be smart and working for an ex-boyfriend isn’t very smart. You don’t have to stop just slow down I’ll jump out.
37650,Leonard,What are you talking about?
37651,Penny,So what happened in Texas that was so bad?
37652,Raj,If you don’t want to meddle then why are you meddling.
37653,Raj,Why the rush? She isn’t going anywhere.
37654,Sheldon,Oh I forgot Sensational Spider-Man.
37655,Penny,Here’s your soup.
37656,Howard,Just hear me out. I’m going to make you guys a scavenger hunt like they have at M.I.T.
37657,Howard,No problem. How’s your mom feeling?
37658,Penny,Are you ready to apologize?
37659,Leonard,Who you bringing?
37660,Sheldon,Hello.
37661,Leonard,No I can’t eat melon.
37662,Howard,You’re in a soup kitchen not a production of Oliver!
37663,Leonard,Deaf women can’t be gold diggers?
37664,Sheldon,Oh yes. I just yesterday you had a a big piece of lettuce stuck in your teeth at lunch. Did I say anything? No. I compromised and kept my mouth shut. Like you should’ve because everyone was laughing at you.
37665,Penny,Wait what do you mean she’s her?
37666,Raj,I have to feel sorry for myself. I’m the only one who cares. Just like I’m the only one who’ll have sex with me.
37667,Penny,It does somehow he managed to take all the fun out of it.
37669,Howard,Maybe I could use it to understand why women keep dumping me.
37670,Leonard,That won’t happen he’s not interested in anything but physics.
37671,Sheldon,I was trying to suggest chemical castration but it’s my bedtime so whatever gets you out the door. Good night.
37672,Leonard,Why not?
37673,Leonard,Now I’m less fine.
37674,Howard,How do you know that?
37675,Penny,What?
37676,Leonard,I move we are the Army Ants all those in favour?
37677,Leonard,Here we go.
37678,Sheldon,I’ve got the Sword of Azeroth!
37679,Leonard,Uh yeah yeah that sounds great.
37680,Leonard,Well I can’t do it I can’t see anything.
37681,Sheldon,If we were in a physical relationship you just lost sex tonight.
37682,Raj,No screw that noise I’m going in. Hang on Santa I’m coming for you.
37684,Howard,A kidney cornea piece of his liver?
37685,Sheldon,Ain’t she great?
37686,Leonard,No I just I want what you have. You know I want a woman in my life.
37687,Sheldon,Mm indeed.
37688,Leonard,Leonard.
37689,Sheldon,I was wearing size a million pants.
37690,Raj,Yes. Also don’t forget to close the toilet or she’ll drink out of it.
37691,Penny,Hi.
37692,Leonard,Robot prostitute.
37693,Sheldon,When we got the security camera.
37694,Penny,He’s a grown man.
37695,Sheldon,All right.
37696,Raj,Hey Leonard will you please tell Howard my sister’s never been attracted to him.
37697,Penny,More specific.
37698,Penny,Oh she’s pregnant? That’s great. You’re gone an uncle. Uncle Sheldon.
37699,Raj,Oh yeah. There’s a reason he’s Sir Elton John. They don’t make you a knight for writing Wake Me Up Before You Go Go.
37700,Leonard,Okay.
37701,Penny,That’s my friend Carol. Remind me I’ve got to introduce her to Howard.
37702,Leonard,I didn’t steal anyone.
37703,Raj,Actually it’s for both of us. Last night I watched West Side Story and I’m a little freaked out by street gangs.
37704,Raj,Light beers? Well Wiki-how about that?
37705,Leonard,Hang on if you’re making all this money where is it?
37706,Leonard,An orang-u-tan?
37707,Sheldon,Be careful with that.
37708,Sheldon,It’s okay everything’s here.
37709,Sheldon,I am moving on. I’m going to be a Bozite.
37710,Sheldon,Sounds like a drama queen. Oh no. It is Jennifer Lawrence.
37711,Leonard,We’re not encouraging. It’s more like knuckling under.
37712,Penny,Okay fine but why would you invite him to our wedding?
37713,Leonard,You mean for someone who’s into comic books?
37714,Sheldon,Not really. I had a bit of an embarrassing evening.
37715,Sheldon,Don’t be ridiculous you love trains.
37716,Sheldon,It’s not. That’s why Leonard does it.
37717,Raj,You know what would be fun? Signing Sheldon up for online dating.
37718,Howard,I find a girl I like and you’re stealing her?
37719,Penny,So what do you need the headphones for?
37720,Raj,Well if anyone’s interested I’ll be spending this Valentine’s Day the same way I spend every Valentine’s Day. Buying a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket taking it home standing over the sink and eating it out of the package with my bare hands like an animal.
37721,Sheldon,I found a hack online. I was able to upload MP3 recordings of my voice to your GPS.
37722,Howard,No.
37723,Sheldon,Why?
37724,Sheldon,I know where my feet have been.
37725,Sheldon,Nuts to that I’m going to Comic-Con.
37726,Penny,Bye.
37727,Leonard,Did you tell him you have a boyfriend?
37728,Penny,Ames hi. How was the wedding?
37729,Sheldon,Yeah well it’s true. But the larger size of the Xbox One may keep it from overheating.
37730,Leonard,Okay. Well now that everyone’s here Penny and I have some big news. We’re engaged.
37731,Sheldon,Wow.
37732,Raj,Not that it’s up to you to make me happy. Uh well unless you find neediness sexy. In which case you’re about to have dinner with the hottest man on the planet.
37733,Sheldon,If I am permitted to speak again Dr. Sheldon Cooper for the win.
37734,Penny,Been hearing that a lot today.
37735,Penny,Well you don’t know everything about me.
37736,Penny,No.
37737,Howard,Come on Sheldon open the door.
37739,Howard,Why?
37740,Sheldon,I’m sure that will happen soon enough. But in the meantime I still want oatmeal.
37741,Leonard,Got it.
37742,Sheldon,Thanks mom. Mom?
37743,Raj,I’m not making any promises.
37745,Raj,I guess that’s okay.
37746,Sheldon,You moved up one. My pen pal in Somalia was kidnapped by pirates. So uh how are you?
37747,Leonard,Don’t I know it.
37748,Sheldon,Bah you didn’t say building on. You’re out.
37749,Penny,That’s interesting.
37750,Sheldon,The reason I was being a pain in the B is because I was worried about him and no one else was.
37751,Penny,You’re kidding.
37752,Sheldon,Watch your fingers. Watch your fingers. Oh God my fingers!
37753,Sheldon,Well I remember waking up in the morning Amy rubbing Vicks on my chest. And her hands were like two frozen chunks of tundra. I took some cold medicine to… I took cold medicine.
37754,Sheldon,Leonard can I ask you a question?
37755,Leonard,Um… yes… I am… asking you out.
37756,Penny,Move it.
37757,Howard,No p-please don’t.
37758,Leonard,Is this what we’re doing the rest of the night?
37759,Raj,Yeah like in the movies I saw growing up in India. You know uh Four for Texas Yellow Rose of Texas.
37760,Leonard,That’s right.
37761,Leonard,What?
37762,Leonard,Wow you ask really hard questions.
37764,Penny,Okay Priya?
37765,Penny,Aw thank you.
37766,Leonard,Good night.
37767,Leonard,I don’t know how you put up with it. He’s impossible. I mean holding a meeting to decide what breakfast cereal we should buy.
37768,Howard,Can I squirt the ultrasound jelly on your stomach?
37769,Leonard,Yeah. Everything since the eighth grade.
37770,Sheldon,Somewhat anthropomorphized but yes. Say maybe sometime you and I can go see monkeys together. Would you like that?
37771,Raj,I bet it is. Why don’t women like me?
37772,Raj,I don’t freaking believe this.
37773,Penny,Well wait wait what’s on top of them.
37774,Penny,Um waitress for six months and then become a movie star.
37775,Raj,It’s like some kind of weird comic book crossover.
37776,Leonard,Aaargh. What the hell?
37777,Sheldon,Hello.
37778,Sheldon,And this music we’re listening to right now is funky as well?
37779,Howard,Thank you. That was the closest I’ve come to sex in like two years.
37780,Leonard,How come scientists don’t win free stuff like salespeople do?
37781,Sheldon,Oh I’m sorry was that supposed to be a secret?
37782,Penny,Okay give. How do you know? Did he tell you?
37783,Leonard,Ha I knew you weren’t asleep.
37784,Raj,When stuff like this gets me down you know what I like to do?
37785,Leonard,If only there were a solution to that.
37786,Penny,Okay are you seriously jealous of me working with Zack?
37787,Howard,What if it’s booby-trapped?
37788,Howard,Damn it he’s good at that too.
37789,Howard,I’m not gay.
37790,Sheldon,No it’s you. All right I hear whispering and giggling. Now I think I hear kissing.
37791,Leonard,Mmm they’re alpha males.
37792,Leonard,I don’t know Raj. Maybe the comic book store doesn’t have a bulletin board.  What’s going on?
37793,Sheldon,Whoa.
37794,Howard,I don’t want to be Aquaman. He sucks. He sucks underwater. He sucks fish pee.
37795,Leonard,Cuddles?
37796,Leonard,How am I the bad guy? She’s the one who married someone else. I’m the victim.
37797,Leonard,Really?
37798,Raj,Well I was up all night trying to write to her but I wanted to run it by you first.
37799,Howard,“Kandorian dry cl…” I give up you can’t have a rational argument with this man.
37800,Penny,Oh boy I think it’s about to get bad.
37801,Howard,Oh snap.
37802,Howard,It’s very nice of you I would like that.
37803,Howard,How long can he keep this up?
37804,Penny,And now Ben Affleck is Batman?
37805,Leonard,Yes.
37806,Leonard,To tell you the truth I think we were both a little I don’t know…
37807,Sheldon,Uh Penny I I have a couple of questions about your closet. Is there any reason you’re keeping this dead goldfish?
37808,Sheldon,Oh yes you should have seen those young people. Thirsty for knowledge drinking in my wisdom. I may have changed a few lives today.
37809,Penny,Excuse me the word is polish. See? Small P.
37810,Sheldon,You want me to use my intelligence in a tawdry competition? Would you ask Picasso to play Pictionary? Would you ask Noah Webster to play Boggle? Would you ask Jacques Cousteau to play Go Fish?
37811,Sheldon,And of course it’s Gravity Probe B.
37812,Raj,So what do you guys want to do?
37813,Sheldon,Well that’s odd. We both washed up when we came in. It’s probably a euphemism for urination.
37814,Leonard,That’s what I’m saying.
37815,Leonard,It wasn’t on?
37816,Sheldon,Oh what fresh hell is this?
37817,Sheldon,That’s how my father always began our football conversations. And if you’d like after the game I’ll take you outside and teach you how to shoot close enough to a racoon that it craps itself.
37818,Sheldon,Is placed the right tense for something that would have happened in the future of a past that was affected by something from the future?
37819,Sheldon,Even you. You’re a slave.
37820,Sheldon,Leonard where did you envision marrying Penny?
37821,Sheldon,Yes
37822,Sheldon,I’m fine.
37823,Howard,Bernadette come on look you’re overthinking this okay? You’re gonna be an amazing mom. Even if you don’t believe it I know you have maternal instincts.
37824,Howard,Bernadette remember your character’s the healer in our group. You’re in charge of healing all of us not just Howard.
37825,Sheldon,Oh! No she’s right I don’t need to know what you were doing. Carry on. 
37826,Sheldon,Just making dinner conversation. Go Team Leonard!
37827,Penny,I thought I said that to you.
37828,Howard,Oh Emily ran back to the hospital so I’m just hanging out at her place. What are you uh what are you doing?
37829,Howard,I’d like to apologize for being insensitive. And for possibly making penguins seem like jerks because 99% of them are stand-up guys.
37830,Sheldon,Maybe I will.
37831,Sheldon,Leonard’s right. We can’t just jump ahead. We have to watch the whole movie.
37832,Howard,What and that’s not offensive? Where’s the line?
37833,Sheldon,Someone will show.
37834,Sheldon,How could it? I never told you and you never bothered to ask.
37835,Howard,Okay. I posted it.
37836,Raj,I’m a little jealous of the people who get to do it.
37837,Raj,No you’re the one who let him in.
37838,Penny,Okay then yeah.
37839,Leonard,Yeah. Penny has about twenty different ways of rolling her eyes that each mean something different.
37840,Raj,Does it work?
37841,Leonard,You’re joking.
37842,Penny,Where No Sheldon Has Gone Before.
37843,Sheldon,Two cherries?
37844,Penny,Ha-ha bite me.
37845,Penny,Really? On top of everything else you’re afraid of birds?
37846,Leonard,Uh well there there’s one thing I feel I should tell you.
37847,Penny,Okay can someone please tell me what’s going on here?
37848,Leonard,Come on Sheldon. Can’t you at least try to understand how much this means to me?
37849,Sheldon,No. That’s it. I am calling campus security. You prepare for the scolding of your life.
37850,Sheldon,I don’t have to believe in it for her to be lucky.
37851,Sheldon,Which I find totally unacceptable. I must be the bigger man. Therefore you may use my spot until such time as I learn to drive or get a Batmobile.
37852,Sheldon,Of course. Pets are banned under the roommate agreement with the exception of service animals such as seeing eye dogs and one day cybernetically-enhanced helper monkeys.
37853,Howard,They put you under for a cleaning?
37854,Leonard,Hey if I roll down the windows in the car everything’s peachy. If you do it you’re still not a doctor.
37855,Sheldon,I’m sorry that’s the end of your inquiry?
37856,Penny,I’m going to write you a cheque for that. As long as you promise to put it in your drawer and never cash it like the others.
37857,Leonard,Well you know It’s easy to take each other for granted and I never want to do that to you because your love it’s like a river. It’s peaceful and deep. Your soul is it’s like a secret that I could never keep.
37858,Sheldon,Yeah but you were neither.
37859,Raj,You think he bites?
37860,Sheldon,What why not?
37862,Sheldon,By the way how are you with zippers?
37863,Raj,It’s completely inappropriate for a single woman to entertain a man in private. If you insist on talking you must do it on the couch! All right you may talk in the bedroom but I want this door to remain open! All right just this once you may close the door. But keep in mind I’ll be right out here monitoring the situation!  Priya this is your brother. When you get this tell Leonard to check his voicemail.
37865,Sheldon,You don’t like written suggestions. You don’t like when I give them to you while we’re urinating in the men’s room. If I didn’t know any better I’d say that you’re one of those stubborn people who are not open to suggestions.
37866,Raj,You think they came up with that? They were going to drink beer and play darts.
37867,Sheldon,Well that’s wonderful. Congratulations.
37868,Howard,So anyway last night on video chat I spent like twenty minutes just staring into Lucy’s eyes.
37869,Howard,Huh. All this time I never knew there were steam tunnels down here.
37870,Sheldon,Oh that was a dead end. Scrambled eggs are as good as they’re ever going to be.
37871,Penny,Yeah my point is it’s a waste of time.
37872,Raj,Oh dear.
37873,Penny,He’s been crying?
37874,Leonard,Sheldon I’m so sorry I dragged you through this.
37875,Raj,Well she was upset at first but probably because her sister shot somebody. Then there was something about you and… then she hugged me.
37876,Penny,Oh my God we’re gonna kill them.
37877,Sheldon,Excuse me in a world that already includes the Big Boy why would I settle for something like a Big Boy?
37878,Sheldon,Was I hit on the head by a coconut.
37879,Leonard,No I’m Leonard.
37880,Leonard,Wait we’re gonna get married again?
37881,Penny,Maybe. But this isn’t about them it’s about us.
37882,Raj,Hey guys.
37883,Leonard,Mm. I found this quiz online called Which Star Trek Character Are You? and it only took me four tries to get Captain Kirk.
37884,Sheldon,Clever but also wrong. No the best organism for human beings to merge with is the lichen itself. That way you’d be human fungus and algae. Triple threat. Like three-bean salad.
37885,Leonard,Okay.
37886,Penny,Sheldon I can’t believe you got us a wedding gift.
37887,Howard,Any news on your co-worker who’s in the hospital?
37888,Leonard,Ooh maybe I could turn it into a gaming den.
37889,Leonard,What?
37890,Penny,Uh something like this. I don’t know. It came free with a full tank of gas.
37891,Penny,Oh my God the George Smoot?
37893,Penny,I will. Why are you making this such a big deal?
37895,Penny,Aw what horrible thing are you trying to make up for?
37896,Leonard,What’s up?
37897,Leonard,Yes please shut up. So um Dave don’t you think you and I should get back to the lab? You know that dark matter isn’t going to detect itself.
37898,Sheldon,What do you think you’re doing?
37899,Raj,Well he’s in my bed. Why can’t I be in his?
37900,Sheldon,Ah Alex excellent. I have a research problem that I believe you can help with.
37901,Sheldon,A group of cats is a clowder. Or a glaring.
37902,Howard,And we’ve built it up in our heads so much.
37903,Raj,You know I’m growing to like American football.
37904,Penny,Yeah okay. Listen I need to talk to Sheldon.
37905,Sheldon,Perfect. Now we really are in a Mexican standoff. Is this one of those times where I’ve won the battle but lost the war?
37906,Howard,Hey Stuart.
37907,Penny,Okay good. She seemed like she really wanted to go out tonight.
37908,Sheldon,I’ll take your word for it. I was too busy trying not to defecate.
37909,Leonard,Hey you didn’t want a Slurpee at 7-Eleven you don’t get glasses.
37910,Sheldon,Good for you. Sign here.
37911,Howard,Well he’s in my bed. Why can’t I be in his?
37913,Sheldon,No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely. What time is your date?
37914,Sheldon,Yes.
37915,Raj,So listen to what he wrote. Uh I saw you play at the comic book store. You guys rock. And then there’s an animated smiley face raising the roof like this.
37916,Raj,Think about this. The only way your mother was born was your Meemaw had sex.
37917,Sheldon,It’s a quark-gluon plasma.
37918,Sheldon,Well thank you. And Leonard never lets me have French toast sticks in the car. I can’t have syrupy fingers but he can do the backstroke in a toilet bowl.
37919,Leonard,Come on you were gonna go up in a rocket designed in the 1960s by the Russians.
37920,Howard,So it spells Sheldon?
37921,Penny,No I just want to know that when you’re at work there’s nothing going on.
37922,Sheldon,That’s a drawing of a really cool train. Don’t look at that either. What do you want?
37923,Leonard,Um let’s see. Hiking. Karaoke in Koreatown. Any Jennifer Aniston movie.
37924,Raj,Mm. Hello Daddy. What’s up?
37925,Sheldon,No no. Let me do the math for you this car weighs let’s say 4000lb now add say 140 for me 120 for you.
37926,Howard,And j and just so you know my favourite movie is Princess Bride.
37927,Leonard,Yeah.
37928,Sheldon,And I have the soulful eyes of a cow.
37929,Leonard,We will.
37930,Sheldon,You should probably go.
37931,Sheldon,Interesting. So it went beyond the mere fact of coitus to a blow by blow as it were.
37932,Sheldon,Well by that logic I should be with someone short dull and needy eh? Not to cast aspersions but I can’t shake a stick around here without hitting that.
37933,Penny,Yeah well it’s easy for you to say. You used to be famous.
37934,Sheldon,Howard is employing a schoolyard paradigm in which you are for all intents and purposes deceased. He intends to act on this by not speaking to you feigning an inability to hear you when you speak and otherwise refusing to acknowledge your existence.
37935,Penny,Yeah. I’m just returning my uniform.
37936,Leonard,Howard.
37937,Howard,Well we’ll just see how your noxious gas fares against my cinnamon-apple-scented aroma therapy candles.
37938,Raj,It doesn’t matter. I’m not keeping this. I’m trying to pay my own way and be responsible. Taking handouts won’t help that.
37939,Raj,Don’t say that. I mean you’re not Dame Judi Dench but you’re pretty great.
37940,Leonard,I think we should be good neighbours invite her over make her feel welcome.
37941,Penny,Oh really? Well then do me a favour and tell Leonard that he can drop dead!
37942,Leonard,It’s dark out and he’s alone I don’t like it. Let’s go get him.
37943,Howard,No I was svelte as a gazelle. A gazelle blessed with a flair for storytelling.
37944,Raj,Well I don’t.
37945,Howard,Wow that’s heavy.
37946,Leonard,Do you have any ideas?
37947,Penny,Penny.
37948,Penny,Sheldon what did you say?
37949,Penny,You know this stuff is horrible. You want to see if we can find the cafeteria and get real coffee?
37950,Penny,Elves? Come on Leonard. It’s too early for Lord of the Rings.
37951,Howard,You said I could buy a desk.
37952,Raj,No ma’am.
37954,Leonard,What are you doing? It’s time to go.
37955,Penny,Oh my God.
37956,Leonard,You really think so?
37958,Raj,Your assistant is totally hitting on this jerk and he loves it.
37959,Sheldon,You mean like Spock?
37960,Sheldon,Of course they are. Leonard’s being one.
37961,Sheldon,Wonderful. would you mind holding up this shirt while I take a quick…?
37962,Leonard,I’m not anticipating coitus.
37963,Sheldon,Which reminds me. This came in the mail and I want you to have it.
37964,Leonard,No offence Stuart but the woman’s a doctor.
37965,Howard,Would you like me to help? I do have a certain je ne sais quois when it comes to soirees.
37966,Leonard,So how are your mom and dad?
37967,Sheldon,Your point being?
37968,Penny,God I thought my brother fresh out of jail was gonna make everyone uncomfortable but now this.
37970,Raj,Here you go.
37971,Sheldon,Well this sandwich is an unmitigated disaster. I asked for turkey and roast beef with lettuce and swiss on wholewheat.
37972,Raj,Oh sure cut the foreigner in half there’s a billion more where he came from.
37973,Sheldon,Wait! Where are you going? Penny come back! I’ll get you ice cream!
37974,Leonard,That doesn’t seem to be where I shine. How about I just give you one of these?
37975,Howard,You have no idea. They buy me a new BMW for my birthday but can I get seat warmers? No. Rajesh if you want a warm butt you’re gonna have to pay for it yourself. Well maybe I will old man.
37976,Penny,No that’s okay Bernadette. Sometimes these things just don’t work out.
37977,Leonard,What’s a dogapus?
37978,Leonard,So?
37979,Raj,Okay I’ll be a badass but only if you pinky-swear to be one too.
37980,Howard,Dude it’s not breathing.
37981,Raj,Okay uh let’s try it again. Uh but this time pretend the girl you want to meet doesn’t want to hurt you.
37982,Penny,Today’s your birthday?
37983,Sheldon,My apologies Leonard I’m only as good as my teacher.
37984,Leonard,Well what’s your plan?
37985,Leonard,Morning.
37987,Sheldon,Your threats are empty nothing can move me.  Stop that.
37988,Leonard,His mom’s been saying that for years. What’s up?
37989,Raj,Okay everybody. Who’s ready for a scavenger hunt?  each each puzzle will lead you to the location of the next the last of which will lead you to the coin. The first team that finds it wins.
37990,Penny,Okay look this is her first time being a bridesmaid and she’s just getting a little crazy with it.
37991,Penny,Chug.
37992,Leonard,Well of course I know why. But just for fun why?
37993,Howard,I don’t know.
37994,Sheldon,The salesman said it could survive a plane crash so perhaps you should fly inside it.
37995,Penny,Really? You always seem so confident.
37996,Raj,How was the hospital?
37997,Leonard,She’s an enigma Raj.
37998,Howard,My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
37999,Sheldon,Howard I’m sick.
38000,Leonard,I’m sorry you are our resident cut-up?
38001,Sheldon,You mean like that high-pitched irritating laugh?
38002,Sheldon,So listen would you describe your ideal vacation as a wild adventure to unknown lands or staying at home curled up with a good book?
38003,Sheldon,Good to know. Big old five.
38004,Sheldon,Hmm. I know exactly what you should do. Unfortunately I cannot tell you.
38005,Howard,Sounds like a plan.
38006,Penny,Okay. Well I guess we’re having a slumber party. Oh!
38007,Sheldon,That sounds like us. I still don’t understand why you’re upset. You solved every puzzle faster than all of the chimps.
38008,Sheldon,Point of clarification are you still going on the trip? Because if not…
38010,Howard,Who’s this mysterious buddy you suddenly have?
38011,Sheldon,Not all germs. Just the ones that will kill me. It’s the same way I’m not afraid of all steak knives just the ones that might be plunged in my thorax.
38012,Sheldon,I may have a better way that you can teach me.
38013,Sheldon,That’s preposterous. How would she go unrecognized just by wearing a wig?
38014,Penny,What are they talking about?
38015,Penny,Sheldon that’s so beautiful.
38016,Leonard,We’re going to Long Beach?
38017,Leonard,Hey I get that you feel bad about all the attention but still what you did is amazing. We’re really proud of you.
38018,Sheldon,Oh I shall.  No!
38019,Penny,Oh you’re my little homunculus.
38020,Leonard,You know ’cause you’re so into science.
38021,Howard,Eating cake on the toilet single.
38022,Sheldon,Question. Was it a Jacuzzi or a hot tub?
38023,Sheldon,My head hurts and I’m more tired than ever.
38024,Leonard,Do I really have to do that now?
38025,Leonard,Hey.
38026,Penny,I looked her in the eye smiled and said I’m happy for you. Because that’s what friends do.
38027,Sheldon,No no Shilly-Shally has red hair and uh he briefly served in the Mexican Navy. Anyway despite the fact that he has a girlfriend Shilly-Shally has been the recipient of inappropriate workplace flirtations from a young lady.
38028,Sheldon,Koothrappali picked me up.
38029,Leonard,What if we infused the bottom layer with silicone-RTV to provide a better mounting surface?
38030,Penny,Yeah but those tickets only get him into Comic-Con. That dress gets me into anywhere I want.
38031,Leonard,What’s important?
38032,Penny,Are you done?
38033,Sheldon,They have a man there who understands my personal style.
38034,Leonard,I know. I also can’t believe he watched what we did on that couch and still sits on it.
38035,Leonard,No I’m not gonna try to pick up a woman in a bar.
38036,Leonard,Morning.
38037,Sheldon,We can but thanks to Steve Jobs we don’t have to.
38038,Sheldon,You didn’t respond to any of my electronic communications.
38039,Howard,Cool cool yeah yeah hold on one second.
38040,Sheldon,Oh that is infuriating. Ooh look they went back up again. Terrific. Oh no they went back down.
38041,Raj,Come on Sheldon. Amy’s only gone for a few months. And now that I’m moving out your old room is empty so you can stay there whenever you want.
38042,Penny,It has also been shown to cause significantly fewer side effects than other oral contraceptives. Although it can cause acne which if you ask me kind of increases its effectiveness as a contraceptive.
38043,Leonard,Well well well Sheldon fancy meeting you here. I guess the train store in Glendale wasn’t having a cotillion after all. And you you said you weren’t coming here either.
38044,Leonard,We’re really sorry. It was an accident.
38046,Penny,Greetings Mary Cooper. I am Spock.
38047,Leonard,Are you actually gonna dance?
38048,Penny,Oh poor thing.
38049,Raj,Maybe you’re right.
38050,Leonard,No no no no hear me out. I know things got a little weird last night.
38051,Raj,So what are we going to do tonight?
38052,Leonard,How was your football party?
38053,Raj,I bought him dinner and we kissed once that was it.  And he told me his name was Kimberley!
38054,Raj,I know.
38055,Penny,Okay.
38056,Penny,That’s the Del Taco.
38057,Sheldon,I’m gonna opt out of that one too.
38058,Penny,How is everything?
38059,Leonard,Uh excellent question. Um I suppose I’ve always been into science you know. My mother and father are scientists so I was kind of led in that direction. Uh pushed might be a better way to describe it. To be honest with you guys when I was your age I wanted to be a rap star. Like Snoop Dogg but with a healthy respect for the police. Yeah no sure you laugh. Just like my mother did. After I confided I was derided and chided my moms and I collided. She said my dreams were misguided. That’s just a little freestyle.
38060,Penny,You’re right I can’t. You know what? Anyone could rent that apartment now an opera singer the cast of stomp yeah a tap-dancing pirate with a wooden leg.
38061,Sheldon,Sucker. Didn’t even ask for the friends and family discount.
38062,Raj,You two should be ashamed of yourselves. Using women to advance your cause with sexuality and whatever Amy plans on doing.
38063,Sheldon,Thank you. You’re not done with her are you?
38064,Leonard,It’s a little insulting don’t you think?
38065,Leonard,Seriously? You haven’t used this desk in years. The second I want to get rid of it you’re up here working?
38066,Leonard,Of course you’d focus on that rather than the inspiration. Uh new salon topic. What’s more important an idea or its execution?
38067,Sheldon,Doesn’t anyone want to know where he’s going?
38068,Howard,What else have you been thinking about doing?
38069,Sheldon,Oh Leonard. Lots of people love you and want to help you but they can’t until you admit the problem.
38070,Sheldon,Why do people cry at weddings?
38071,Penny,Ooh me.
38072,Sheldon,And yet now you’re in my office. Point Cooper. Welcome to the Thunderdome Kripke.
38073,Raj,Don’t worry. You’re surrounded by your C-Men.
38074,Leonard,Well at least listen to it through headphones. I’m trying to sleep. Good night.
38075,Sheldon,Still sounds like a lot of unnecessary touching.
38076,Penny,Yeah me too.
38077,Penny,How much beer have you had?
38078,Sheldon,Well if that’s the case then your grandparents mumble and have bad posture.
38079,Sheldon,That is true. I have a higher than normal body density. If I run too deep a bath I drown.
38080,Sheldon,Well now see? You knew what was gonna happen. Why didn’t they? Anyway now we’re committed to completing this project in a ridiculously short time frame and everyone’s upset with me.
38081,Sheldon,I hope his character doesn’t make it into the movie he’s kind of a bummer.
38082,Raj,Oh they think we’re flanking they’re playing right into our hands. On the count of three we execute the flying scissor. One two…
38083,Sheldon,You did.
38084,Raj,Well they already had a village.
38085,Leonard,You just got him this afternoon.
38086,Penny,Okay. You know what? This might be the wine talking but I have a very important question to ask you.
38087,Sheldon,So can you get it working?
38088,Howard,The Indian sex book. In other words if you wonder wonder who wrote the book of love it was us.
38090,Howard,Bernadette please tell your boyfriend to cool it with the cow jokes.
38091,Sheldon,Detailed analysis posted online.
38092,Leonard,Hey I thought you were finding new friends.
38093,Howard,Flip a coin. You got a fifty-fifty shot.
38094,Leonard,No I told her she was being not smart. Which was dumb.
38095,Sheldon,Hang on. Are you now or have you ever been a salsa Irish folk or break-dancer?
38096,Leonard,Not like I guess I’m in. Like I guess I’m in!
38097,Sheldon,Okay now that everyone’s here we can begin.
38098,Sheldon,Isn’t that their burden? I’m the one with something interesting to say.
38099,Howard,Little Lalita. That’s kind of fun to say. Little Lalita Little Lalita Little Lalita you should try it.
38101,Leonard,Yes you did didn’t you?
38102,Penny,Can you keep him quiet? Maybe jangle some keys in front of him?
38103,Leonard,It doesn’t matter. I’m the king of foreplay.
38104,Sheldon,Yeah well tell it to someone who cares.
38105,Penny,I’m just saying you pretend you don’t but you have feelings just like everybody else.
38107,Sheldon,Chuck Norris wishes. In binary 73 is a palindrome one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one which backwards is one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one exactly the same. All Chuck Norris backwards gets you is Sirron Kcuhc.
38108,Leonard,No I did not.
38109,Sheldon,Oh no the new ones they’re here.
38110,Penny,Really? You can’t think of anyone weirder?
38111,Penny,I’m not gonna fall in love with Sheldon.
38112,Sheldon,Is it safe to assume you’re not speaking to me again? If you’re not answering because you’re not speaking to me perhaps we could come up with a signal. That works.
38113,Sheldon,Fascinating.
38114,Sheldon,Darts is a bar game. You’ve been frequenting drinking establishments since you were of legal age.
38115,Howard,Well you could be very frugal. I’m getting a little tired of everybody’s sarcasm.
38116,Howard,Team Baby go.
38117,Leonard,Actually they were only digging in the wrong place because Indy had the medallion. Without him they would have had the medallion and dug in the right place.
38118,Penny,No I can’t. Reading books is a big part of my life now because you know we’d have more fun things to talk about if I read more.
38119,Howard,Thank you.
38120,Sheldon,Oh you don’t need to worry about her. She’s brilliant and attractive. She can do way better
38121,Penny,I can’t believe we thought this would makes us feel grown up.
38122,Leonard,Great great. Did you walk the whole way? It’s a little chilly.
38123,Leonard,With lime jello?
38124,Leonard,Look at that. Some day we will tell future generations that dating used to be hard.
38125,Sheldon,Of course. Excuse me. This will just take a moment.
38126,Penny,Oh! That’s very cool.
38127,Sheldon,You ever wonder how humans would be different if they evolved from lizards instead of mammals?
38128,Raj,Okay what page are you on?
38129,Penny,Hey Sheldon you want to play next?
38130,Leonard,I bet that bit killed at The Chuckle Hut.
38131,Leonard,Aaaa-aw!
38132,Leonard,Hey.
38133,Penny,Yeah come on tell us more.
38134,Raj,It would be nice to have the increased income. Stop taking money from my parents.
38135,Leonard,Cut to the chase Sheldon.
38136,Sheldon,Penny for your thoughts.
38137,Penny,Just a sec.  Hello?
38138,Raj,Hey an animal can be both sacred and delicious.
38139,Sheldon,Leonard she’s in my spot.
38140,Leonard,Uh-uh give it a minute.
38142,Leonard,Then why learn how to swim?
38143,Leonard,Sure let’s make it an even hundred.
38144,Penny,Sheldon I’m surprised you’d choose to go to a pub.
38145,Leonard,Why do they say AA?
38146,Raj,Twenty minutes a day completely unaccounted for.
38147,Leonard,No. Hey do you remember that time when I proposed to you in bed? And you were all like what are you doing? That was so funny. So funny.
38148,Leonard,Hey where you been?
38149,Sheldon,Nine o’clock? What happened to eight and seven and all the other o’clocks?
38150,Raj,Can’t believe it. We’re going to meet Stan Lee! 
38151,Sheldon,You can’t. If you were to prevent yourself from buying it in the past you would not have it available in the present to travel back and stop yourself from buying it ergo you would still have it. This is a classic rookie time travel mistake.
38152,Raj,Why?
38153,Howard,I learned that for free from a cat poster but good for you.
38154,Howard,Stir the gravy.
38155,Sheldon,I am.
38156,Sheldon,In the bedrooms of ten-year-old girls where they belong.
38157,Sheldon,I’m ba-ack!
38158,Leonard,You and Leslie?
38159,Raj,So how are you gonna return the DVD if the store went out of business?
38160,Leonard,No Raj had to go to the nurse.
38161,Howard,It’s right here.
38162,Leonard,Hey.
38163,Sheldon,Thank you. Hello neighbour.
38164,Leonard,Never should’ve told you about Alvin and the Chipmunks.
38165,Leonard,Hey.
38166,Howard,I didn’t bring it up. You did.
38167,Howard,I can and I did look up dibs on Wikipedia.
38168,Raj,Uh yeah. Why do you ask?
38169,Leonard,I don’t listen for it but it’s nice to know everything’s okay with your plumbing. The building’s plumbing.
38170,Leonard,Sheldon it’s not a great time what do you want?
38172,Sheldon,You must be here to give me advice.
38173,Sheldon,Yes but I rephrased it to avoid offending the hos.
38174,Penny,So he’s my ex-boyfriend who cares? I can’t believe Leonard would be so insecure.
38175,Leonard,That might work too.
38176,Leonard,Sheldon you are one day late for your haircut.
38177,Sheldon,Excellent. Then I shall see you tomorrow. Good night Dr. Fowler.
38178,Penny,Aw sweetie you just made my day.
38179,Sheldon,Excuse me I’m going to relieve myself.
38180,Penny,I’m not gonna say your password out loud. That is not secure.
38181,Leonard,He’d probably give you homework.
38182,Sheldon,Why? We won. You know I say next we take on Koothrappali and his dog. Really give ourselves a challenge.
38183,Sheldon,All right but you’re not fooling me. Whenever you say we have to talk it means you want me to listen.
38184,Penny,Okay listen to me. Your relationship can handle being long distance for a while. It’s not like you two are very physical.
38185,Penny,I don’t have one.
38186,Leonard,Why do I bother talking to you people?
38188,Leonard,Seriously?
38189,Sheldon,No no I understand. Anything happened to my mee-maw I’d be one inconsolable moon pie. I should clarify that statement by explaining that she calls me moon pie.
38190,Sheldon,You don’t even know what it is do you? The anthropic principle states that if we wish to explain why our universe exists the way it does the answer is that it must have qualities that allow intelligent creatures to arise who are capable of asking the question. As I am doing so eloquently right now.
38191,Penny,Okay if that’s true why aren’t there more genius squirrels?
38192,Sheldon,Probably serving food that was ordered today.
38193,Penny,Um does this have anything to do with Leonard’s work?
38194,Penny,Then it’s settled.
38195,Sheldon,It is a big whoop. It made almost all the work you’ve done since you’ve been here completely useless.
38196,Raj,This is exciting.
38197,Leonard,If there was a Nobel Prize for Millennium Falcons that fall apart when you pick them up we’d be set.
38198,Sheldon,That’s the toilet?
38199,Sheldon,I drink tea all the time. I think I know what I’m doing.
38200,Sheldon,You know I am very disappointed that I won’t be able to celebrate Howard’s accomplishment tonight.
38201,Howard,Now that Sheldon’s across the hall have you decided what you’re doing with his old room?
38202,Raj,It wasn’t so are you in?
38203,Leonard,No no I’m not jealous I just think you have got a good thing going where you are right now and you make great money and you haven’t slept with any of your co-workers.
38205,Howard,I think this thing was made in China.
38206,Raj,Don’t worry I can take a hint. No more murder mystery parties.
38207,Raj,Well I need a wingman. I don’t want to come off like a lonely loser.
38208,Leonard,Oh. Well I have some work to do so…
38209,Howard,It’s a lease.
38210,Penny,Why did you tell Howard I was hiding Leonard’s things?
38212,Sheldon,Would you like to hear another reason why men are better than women?
38213,Sheldon,Yes well I’m polymerised tree sap and you’re non-organic adhesive so whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction is reflected off of me returns on its original trajectory and adheres to you.
38215,Leonard,If I were you I’d be more concerned by what they’re passing off as chicken.
38216,Sheldon,I want you to admit that what you did was wrong.
38217,Sheldon,I made tea.
38218,Sheldon,Again not enough evidence. For all we know he’s being murdered. Now back to our game.
38219,Raj,I’m not defacing it I’m fixing it.
38220,Sheldon,Just making polite dinner conversation. Your turn.
38221,Howard,You mean like fatties and uggos?
38222,Sheldon,Wise decision. You see Amy success at a bar is based on classic male attributes such as height strength attractiveness the ability to hold one’s liquor and throw darts separately or together. Leonard has none of these attributes right Leonard?
38223,Howard,I’m taking you home.
38224,Leonard,Aw hell I miss him.
38225,Sheldon,The learning opportunities would be abundant. Additionally I like having my belly scratched.
38226,Sheldon,You still didn’t pick a date.
38227,Penny,Hey you know what Leonard I know I said I could handle your roommate but I was wrong. We’re going to have to break up.
38228,Sheldon,If only Penny had said that once in a while.
38229,Howard,It’s fantastic apparently the camera loves me and I it. They shot me in front of a starry background where I posed like this.  They’re going to digitally add a supernova they say it’s the perfect metaphor for my incandescent talent.
38230,Penny,Oh well then you you do it.
38231,Raj,Calm down. Howard has something he wants to say to you.
38232,Raj,Just tell me which one you think is more manly. This hockey jersey or this football jersey.
38233,Leonard,You still told her I lied.
38234,Raj,Well what are we waiting for? Let’s bounce bitches.
38235,Sheldon,Oh no of course. I understand. You’re afraid the world isn’t ready for your taboo love. Your secret’s safe with me.
38236,Howard,Okay but something smells fishy. And not just because you work around sea animals. That actually sounds interesting and I’d like to learn more about it. Hey you okay?
38237,Sheldon,No I can still hear it. Oh wait that’s me. Never mind it’s fine.
38238,Leonard,Uh yes.
38239,Penny,Well for one thing we’re late for Leonard’s birthday party. And for another I told him to call security.
38240,Leonard,We could be betas. They’re second in charge.
38241,Penny,Ooh. Maybe I like it.
38242,Leonard,Hey I was just… what is happening?
38243,Sheldon,Yeah and some thanks I got. The assistant manager chased me out with an artisanal salami.
38244,Sheldon,Oh what did he say?
38245,Leonard,Well then tell your face.
38246,Raj,Okay as soon as she gets here so she knows I’m cool with it I’m going to make a joke about her being deaf. I was thinking hey did you hear the one about…? Oh no I bet you didn’t.
38247,Sheldon,What is shaking?
38248,Leonard,Uh-huh.
38249,Leonard,Are you implementing phase two?
38250,Howard,And about three hundred dollars worth of makeup so this thief could look like anyone right now.
38251,Sheldon,All right well to sum up focus on science keep your nose out of other people’s business and uh whoa for a good time call Bert.
38252,Penny,Get anything good?
38253,Penny,Thank you all for this high honour.
38254,Sheldon,No. Or to use the clinical term nuh-uh.
38255,Sheldon,I want to leave.
38256,Leonard,Yes.
38257,Penny,For three months?
38258,Penny,Leonard why do you always do this? Listen to me you’re the one I’m with. You know I love you so will you please relax because you’re driving me crazy.
38259,Leonard,I’m sorry is he waiting for someone to disagree?
38260,Leonard,Does it really need to say that?
38261,Leonard,I’m going to a party. I’m not turning R2-D2 and C-3PO over to the empire!
38262,Raj,All right let’s buckle down and work.
38263,Penny,He won’t be mad at me. I mean you’re the one who doesn’t want my brother to come so…
38264,Sheldon,Yeah take whatever you want.
38265,Sheldon,Yeah I have it on Blu-ray. We should watch it.
38266,Sheldon,I’m sorry how is this better than uncomfortable silence?
38267,Leonard,Women. Who knows what’ll set ’em off?
38268,Leonard,Lesley this is Penny she lives across the hall from Sheldon and me.
38269,Penny,Okay look I know what a good person you are but sometimes people think you might come off a little harsh.
38270,Penny,Hey Sheldon.
38271,Raj,I’ll pull the van up.
38272,Leonard,What if I get caught?
38273,Sheldon,Great. Now Mandarin.
38274,Howard,Okay uh what if we make Rocket Man your ringtone and the next time you talk to those guys I’ll call you and they’ll hear it. Plant the seed.
38275,Howard,Whoa whoa. Walking up to a strange woman in a bar usually doesn’t work.
38276,Raj,I’m sorry are you under the impression that we’re still friends?
38277,Leonard,And that is how a short asthmatic scientist landed a stone cold fox.
38278,Sheldon,Is he okay?
38279,Howard,Okay I’m going to play it cool. Tell her maybe. Whatever babe.
38280,Sheldon,Hey. Is everything smoothed out with Amy?
38281,Sheldon,Hi Stephanie. I’m sorry I’m late but your companion left the most indecipherable invitation.
38282,Howard,Oh. What if Leonard made an appointment and tried to lay some groundwork for you?
38283,Sheldon,That’s right Sheldon Cooper. He was bitten by his neighbour’s dog leading to his first scientific breakthrough the doggie death-ray. Which sadly he couldn’t build because Santa wouldn’t bring him enriched uranium.
38284,Raj,And he’s picking the tomatoes out of his salad just like I do. I always did feel a connection with him. Oh I have got an idea.
38285,Sheldon,Well that explains those puzzling camel race photos on your Facebook page.
38286,Raj,What time do you and Bernadette head out?
38287,Penny,Step one worms.
38288,Sheldon,When I have enough to destroy all the human toast on the battlestar known as Galactica. Is that what you’re wearing to watch football at Penny’s?
38289,Leonard,Still doesn’t explain how you ended up on the freeway divider.
38290,Sheldon,This is preposterous. I think you’re giving me these tasks because you’re afraid if you give me anything meaningful to do I’ll show you up.
38291,Raj,I’m sorry this does not look like Texas. Where’s the tumbleweeds? Where’s the saloons?
38292,Leonard,Well glad you’re feeling better.
38293,Leonard,Whatever you do just don’t make any rash decisions.
38294,Raj,Anyway any ideas on a gift?
38295,Leonard,Sure.
38296,Leonard,Since when do you take after-dinner walks?
38297,Penny,What did you tell them?
38298,Sheldon,Although for the record on one occasion she licked her thumb to remove raspberry jelly from the corner of my mouth. It’s an action we both regret to this day.
38299,Raj,We can still be swashers.
38300,Howard,What? Another one. You know it it’s weird. When they’re reading your profile does it does it make you feel exposed? Like they see you naked?
38301,Sheldon,Yes?  Peace?
38302,Leonard,Your cousin Leopold?
38303,Leonard,No but you’re right. I should march over there and ask her out.
38304,Sheldon,Not bad I myself started graduate school at fourteen.
38305,Leonard,Ummm I’m gonna go with “no.”
38306,Howard,I can’t stop thinking about it.
38307,Raj,And we made it in only three hours. Sounds just like store-bought.
38308,Raj,I am. And now I’m crying for a whole different reason!
38309,Leonard,Oh yeah? And you thought Spock ears were only good for Comic-Con.
38310,Leonard,Hang on. Can you do any better?
38311,Raj,The housekeeper does the shopping.
38312,Sheldon,Oh how I wish I could.
38313,Sheldon,I did not get a clear answer. I’m gonna set this down now.
38314,Sheldon,They would wouldn’t they? We could give them cool Martian names. And we could teach them about Martian history. Like who planted those flags? And uh where did that copy of Mars Attacks! come from?
38315,Raj,No no I don’t know if I should. If she wanted me to know about her blog she would’ve told me. It’s almost like I’m reading her diary.
38316,Raj,Is this just so we won’t touch your stuff while you’re away?
38317,Sheldon,Unlikely. That’s a television show Leonard.
38318,Leonard,What are you gonna do?
38319,Howard,Yeah well I do. And when my wingman is carrying a Green Lantern lantern I drink a lot. I’ll have a screwdriver please. Don’t be chintzy with the screw.
38320,Leonard,What are you doing?
38321,Penny,Yeah.
38322,Sheldon,Okay I have to tell you something but you’re not going to like it.
38323,Leonard,Howard what did you do?
38324,Leonard,Oh I guess so.
38325,Sheldon,Oh it’s no trouble it’s actually a pleasure.
38326,Sheldon,Hi uh Penny this circular is addressed to occupant but with our apartment switch it’s unclear whether it’s yours or mine.
38327,Leonard,Helping women? Y
38328,Leonard,You tell me you woke up in bed with one.
38329,Sheldon,Okay another 30 feet.
38330,Sheldon,Leonard do you not recall the last time we visited this gentleman we returned home without pants?
38331,Penny,No I haven’t.
38332,Sheldon,Well then it’s all settled Christie will stay with Howard Penny can go back to her apartment and I’ll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who although at this point it’s more like Doctor Why Bother.
38334,Penny,There’s a tree on you.
38335,Sheldon,Hi. Um I’ve reconsidered. Uh you can’t work where I work. Enjoy the rest of your evening.
38336,Leonard,What is that?
38337,Sheldon,Oh I think we both know the answer to that question.
38338,Howard,Yeah sorry for clicking on that.
38339,Leonard,No we’re both to blame. You know let me take the heat on this one.
38340,Howard,What’s that one?
38341,Raj,You’re welcome ladies.
38342,Raj,Stuart settle an argument for us. Who would win Billy the Kid or the White Wizard?
38343,Sheldon,I’m not afraid to be alone. On land. On the sea it would be terrifying. Because of all the drowning.
38344,Penny,Okay relax. I took off the slipcovers had them dry-cleaned and then fumigated the cushions.
38345,Leonard,We all know the reason. Sheldon what are you getting at?
38346,Howard,Why is the key always confidence? How come it’s never love handles and flop sweat?
38347,Sheldon,And to think I idolized that man. And why? At the end of the day he’s just another Hollywood phony.
38348,Sheldon,Yes and evenly distributed amongst brown white free range large extra-large and jumbo.
38349,Sheldon,Yes it is. There’s a loophole in the Relationship Agreement.
38350,Sheldon,He didn’t respond to my e-mail his phone number is unlisted. Tell me what my other option was.
38351,Howard,Yeah that sounds fun. A party-bus party don’t stop. Ooh when I say party you say bus.
38352,Penny,Nothing nothing. You know if we weren’t friends and you hadn’t brought up that creepy pornography story I’d be on you like the speed of light squared on matter to make energy.
38353,Leonard,Believe it or not personal growth. What happened?
38354,Leonard,Ugh!
38355,Leonard,A lot of people are doing that.
38356,Raj,Hmm. What if he’s in prison? What if he’s a spy? What if he’s in a Beatles cover band? I’m just saying if he’s got your nose and haircut he’d make a killer Ringo.
38357,Leonard,Sheldon I don’t think this actually means…
38358,Penny,Well good for you. Come on in.
38359,Penny,I think you have a great capacity for devotion. You’ll be lonely when she passes on won’t you? I understand what that is.
38360,Sheldon,You don’t need to reimburse me because I’m not paying. On Thursday I will have my day in court and justice will be done. In fact I’m going to begin preparing my defence right now.
38361,Leonard,Yeah sorry. Uh you come to the end of the tunnel and find a large chest. What do you do? And Howard do not say I feel up the large chest.
38362,Howard,Look at that. You’ve known you’re gonna be a father for less than a day and you’re already stepping up.
38363,Raj,Howard Wolowitz?
38364,Leonard,I know what you’re thinking I’ve taken your asthma into account. There’s a feline geneticist in San Diego who has developed the cutest little hypo-allergenic calicos.
38365,Sheldon,Initiate landing sequence. Initiate landing sequence. Hey the camera’s working. Oh look it’s me.
38366,Sheldon,All right either blow your nose or teach it to play Camptown Races.
38368,Penny,Wow. You can really arrange that?
38369,Sheldon,Fine. It’s a shame you didn’t go to dinner with us because the buffet you’re about to enjoy only serves humble pie a dessert much less tasty than frozen yoghurt. I was this close.
38370,Sheldon,Don’t hurt us don’t hurt us
38371,Sheldon,Way to kill the mood.
38372,Sheldon,No no he’s over there.
38373,Penny,Well if that doesn’t make me the favourite aunt I don’t know what will. Is this me?
38375,Raj,You want me to work with you?
38376,Leonard,You just happen to have those in the car?
38377,Sheldon,You know exactly. We’ve never thrown a brunch before and I wanted to work out all the kinks.
38378,Sheldon,Leonard you’ll never guess who I just found online. Hey!
38379,Leonard,Elevators parks movie theatres out of curiosity is this subway the transportation system or subway the sandwich shop?
38380,Penny,Ew why?
38381,Howard,What just happened?
38382,Leonard,If you don’t do this I won’t take you to the comic book store.
38383,Leonard,Really?
38384,Penny,Oh hey Sheldon! How is San Francisco?
38387,Sheldon,Dividing our belongings is difficult.
38388,Howard,It will be. I don’t call anyone a ho and the only time I use the phrase my bitch I’m referring to you.
38389,Leonard,Working it? You can’t even talk to her.
38390,Penny,Oh that’s all right. All I heard was skinny.
38391,Sheldon,If we’re just going to drive around aimlessly the least you could do is take me for ice cream.
38392,Howard,Thanks for inviting me after everyone else said no. Aren’t you gonna get 3-D glasses?
38393,Raj,Yeah sure.
38394,Penny,All right where is tall British Dave taking you?
38395,Sheldon,No. The X-Men were named for the X in Charles Xavier. Since I am Sheldon Cooper you will be my C-Men.
38396,Sheldon,I know but why?
38397,Sheldon,Good. Now we’re getting somewhere.
38398,Penny,Hey same goes for the two of you with Amy.
38399,Howard,Incredible. You managed to screw up the screw-up.
38400,Sheldon,Seems unlikely. Did you bring your asthma inhaler?
38402,Raj,It’s horrible. Why would you push a cow over? They’re sacred.
38403,Leonard,That’s just research. We’re never gonna make any money from it.
38404,Leonard,Anyway um. We brought home Indian food. And um. I know that moving can be stressful and I find that when I’m undergoing stress that good food and company can have a comforting effect. Also curry is a natural laxative and I don’t have to tell you that uh a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about.
38405,Penny,Come on I spent an entire plane ride with you talking about the trailer for Deadpool 2.
38406,Raj,None of your business. Take it or leave it.
38407,Raj,Oh. What if Leonard made an appointment and tried to lay some groundwork for you?
38408,Raj,Let’s find out. Leonard ready?
38409,Leonard,Sounds right a limited edition collectible worth hundreds of dollars and a thing that grew out of a thing we fished from the trash.
38411,Sheldon,In pre-1976 terms neener-neener.
38412,Raj,I always thought Peppermint Patty was a lesbian?
38413,Sheldon,Only if the answer is shopping for baby shoes.
38414,Howard,Thank you but it doesn’t look like I’m going to Comic-Con this year.
38415,Leonard,Aw and my girlfriend wouldn’t let me get one. Look at my face. Do I look smug? I feel smug.
38416,Penny,No I’m talking to him because he’s cute.
38417,Leonard,Shut up.
38418,Leonard,Well for me too. It’s not the same with you gone.
38419,Sheldon,You realise that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy.
38420,Sheldon,Here you go. This is now the only lab with glassware washed by a man with two doctorates and a restraining order signed by Carl Sagan.
38421,Penny,Who’s Radiohead?
38422,Sheldon,Wait wait. Svaty Vaclav is better known as Good King Wenceslas from the beloved Victorian Christmas carol.
38423,Penny,I don’t know just think about something else.
38424,Sheldon,Penny has dragged a chair in off the street whose unknown provenance jeopardizes the health and welfare of every resident in our building.
38425,Sheldon,I don’t know. If we’re going to start a fantasy sword collection and I’ve long thought we should is this really the sword to start with?
38426,Sheldon,Oh sure grope every other male on the planet but draw the line with me.
38427,Sheldon,She’s gonna hate waiting in line for the panels.
38428,Sheldon,Brown rice not white rice?
38429,Raj,But Amy when you and Sheldon split up didn’t you start dating someone right away?
38430,Raj,Good black is more slimming. Oh that’s her. I got to go be butch. Toodles. Hey.
38431,Penny,I don’t know but I may have to find a cheaper place to live.
38432,Howard,Yeah let me start practicing for it. Do you want fries with that Maharaja Mac?”
38433,Sheldon,What you think just because you’re wearing a captain’s uniform you’re in charge?
38434,Sheldon,Nope. The only thing left to do now is assign blame.  Nice going.
38435,Penny,Oh disgusting.
38436,Sheldon,Tonight works better for me.
38437,Leonard,I really do.
38438,Sheldon,Well this is an interesting development.
38439,Sheldon,Brobdingnagian Brobdingna… How did you even get it in here?
38440,Penny,Okay. Well wait what about Leonard?
38441,Howard,Just tell her what I’m really like. And if you think it’ll help that you saw me changing once and my package reminded you of the muscular tail of a jaguar. Use your own words.
38442,Penny,It was fine.
38443,Penny,Really let it go.
38444,Penny,Uh hey maybe when you’re done with her printer you could set up mine. You know like you promised a week ago.
38445,Leonard,That one over there.
38446,Leonard,I thought because our relationship’s in a beta test you wanted to take things slow.
38447,Penny,Okay well that’s really cool of you.
38448,Leonard,Because it is what you want and it’s not what you said.
38449,Sheldon,Oh don’t be. You were like a foxy tea kettle.
38450,Raj,Oh please.When it comes to Terminators you’ve got a better shot of scoring with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
38451,Leonard,I don’t know it’s still a little weird since you know…
38452,Penny,She’ll be in her crate it’s not a big deal.
38453,Raj,Hey so what did you guys think of the new episode of Caprica last night?
38454,Howard,Penny you became disenchanted with Leonard as a lover. Would you please tell my sister why?
38455,Sheldon,That is a bracing cold an invigorating cold. Lord is it cold!
38456,Leonard,No take the couch or my bed I just got new pillows hypo-allergenics.
38457,Sheldon,Now if MA equals MG what does that imply?
38458,Sheldon,The entire institution of gift giving makes no sense.
38459,Raj,Sticks and stones may break my bones but chairs on sticks are comfy.
38460,Sheldon, Then it’s not dancing night.
38461,Sheldon,Okay. I’m inside the CERN super collider.
38462,Penny,Told yah! .
38463,Penny,Yeah tell me about it.
38464,Sheldon,I don’t know but if cats could sing they’d hate it too. .
38465,Howard,Yeah.
38466,Sheldon,Who leaves their bike in the hallway? You know if I knew how to ride one I’d steal it.
38467,Leonard,Funny expression sleep tight. It refers to the early construction of beds which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes which would occasionally… sleep tight.
38468,Penny,Sweetie are you sure you don’t want to come with us to the funeral?
38469,Howard,What does that mean?
38470,Penny,Thanks. Target four ninety-nine. I’m getting a drink.
38471,Sheldon,Leonard are we having a serious conversation or not?
38472,Sheldon,Hey good buddy. So uh I was just talking to Amy and she made me realize that this little dust-up between you and me is much ado about nothing.
38474,Raj,Oh okay false alarm. Little parenting tip sleeping babies hate flash photography.
38475,Leonard,Good night Sheldon.
38476,Howard,Adjust the thermostat cook with cilantro pronounce the T in often?
38477,Sheldon,What if my room has a claw-foot bathtub?
38478,Sheldon,Um…
38479,Penny,Honey this is a big deal for Leonard okay? He gets to work with Stephen Hawking. Who by the way will not be on the boat. I checked it out.
38480,Leonard,Go away.
38481,Sheldon,The truth can indeed be a finger down the throat of those unprepared to hear it. But why should I cater to second-rate minds?
38482,Sheldon,Really? I didn’t see you in there.
38483,Sheldon,It’s simple really. It occurred to me that knowing and not knowing can be achieved by creating a macroscopic example of quantum superposition. The the principle that a physical system exists partially in all its possible states at once.
38484,Sheldon,Move across the hall? Did you take a marijuana?
38485,Howard,That’s a little vulgar for the dinner table don’t you think?
38486,Penny,Okay look he bought you this.
38487,Sheldon,You just can’t keep it in your space pants can you?
38488,Leonard,Problem?
38489,Leonard,So?
38490,Leonard,Really? I’ve never done that before. Does it work?
38491,Penny,Oh that was fast. Did she sneeze the baby out?
38492,Raj,I’ve got the phone number of the tubby girl from Comic-Con.
38493,Sheldon,Raj is teaching me to make croissants.
38494,Sheldon,Yes. In preparation for today’s studies I read Stanislavski’s An Actor Prepares Stella Adler’s
38495,Leonard,So Alex what’s the topic of your dissertation?
38496,Raj,Some of it makes sense some of it’s crazy. My point is you can’t go out with Leonard.
38497,Penny,And he’s sad about it.
38498,Raj,Yeah no. But yet here you two are still together. And that’s even after you and I had our crazy naked night.
38499,Leonard,No reason. I’m just glad to hear you’re comfortable saying you love something.
38500,Sheldon,Why are you such a stupid head? That is also rhetorical. I’m sorry you had to hear that.
38501,Penny,No.
38502,Sheldon,Great. I’ll go first.
38503,Sheldon,You’re really okay with that?
38504,Howard,All right. 
38505,Leonard,Where did you get that?
38506,Sheldon,Brightly shone the moon that night though the frost was cruel. When a poor man came in sight gathering winter fuel.
38507,Leonard,I was gonna say or but why bother?
38508,Sheldon,Hey Howard. You’re a Jew. If there was another wailing wall exactly like the one in Jerusalem but close to taco stands and cheap prescription drugs would you still be able to wail at it? Okay it’s definitely me.
38509,Leonard,What do you want?
38510,Sheldon,You can’t talk you’re paralyzed. I get right up in Santa’s big fat face and say well well well jolly old Saint Nick we meet again. Yeah I believe the last time we spoke was in the Baybrook Mall in Galveston Texas when I was five years old isn’t that right?
38511,Penny,Oh great. You know what? I’ve already mooched dinner off you guys. I don’t need to listen to this.
38512,Howard,Oh.
38513,Leonard,No.
38514,Sheldon,What kind of person leaves his keys in the car?
38515,Leonard,Yeah okay like you said.
38516,Sheldon,Hello.
38517,Leonard,Look you’re here we have plenty of room.
38518,Raj,I got you a talking Thomas the Tank Engine for Thanksgiving.
38519,Penny,I’m serious. Who wants to do all that stuff? Have insurance pay mortgages leave one of those little notes when you hit a parked car.
38520,Leonard,Watch watch out watch out for pedestrians!
38521,Penny,Well maybe we’ll hang out later you know after everybody’s gone.
38522,Leonard,Well do you think when she and I had that conversation she left people off her list?
38523,Leonard,Great topic. I can help with that. There are lots of different perspectives you can take economic sociological political.
38524,Penny,Well then it’s settled. Yay. So funny. I never thought my second marriage would be to you.
38525,Sheldon,Duly noted Steve from Wichita.
38526,Leonard,What do we do kick them off?
38527,Leonard,Yes how did we live before Twitter? I guess you’ll find out what it is in the morning.
38528,Howard,Thank you. I apprec….  apprec…. appreeee…. oh-oh.
38529,Howard,Also the pretty girl left.
38530,Leonard,Go ahead it’s fine.
38531,Leonard,Yes
38532,Penny,What’s up with Ichabod?
38533,Penny,How old are you?
38534,Sheldon,Oh and do you remember what you said?
38535,Penny,Bees. Aaah! I just got that physicist joke.
38536,Penny,Oh sweetie guests don’t normally wear corsages to a wedding. That’s more of a prom thing.
38537,Raj,Oh uh these are my my friends. This is Bernadette.
38538,Leonard,Where do you think I would take you?
38539,Leonard,Well you’re welcome.
38540,Leonard,Every idea is better than this idea.
38541,Howard,What do you think we should sell it for?
38542,Penny,What do you mean why?
38543,Penny,Yeah but if we stay there we won’t have to be quiet.
38544,Sheldon,Really?
38545,Raj,Hey you already got a girlfriend. I call dibs.
38546,Howard,Why did you do that?
38549,Raj,And Gertie can’t stop crying.
38550,Leonard,No occasion. You know things have been a little weird between us so I wanted to throw together a fun night just for you.
38551,Sheldon,This is ridiculous we’re shopping for a party and this store doesn’t even have a party section.
38552,Penny,Sheldon what do you want?
38554,Penny,You heard what I did?
38555,Sheldon,I don’t say anything. I merely offer you a facial expression that suggests you’ve gone insane.
38556,Howard,Well me neither.
38557,Penny,Uh Leonard this is Zack. Zack Leonard.
38558,Leonard,So she’s just been lying to him?
38559,Leonard,Yes you walked around for a week saying Sheldon unhappy with casting choice.
38560,Howard,No. The moment has passed.
38561,Raj,Did the listing actually say miniature?
38563,Howard,Oh of course we can. Uh you girls have a good time. She said I was in charge.
38564,Raj,Anyway it’s a beautiful time of year. Uh you travel through the vineyards. There’s a tasting on board. And all the wild flowers are in bloom. It’s magic.
38565,Leonard,Man I can not catch a break.
38566,Raj,It’s okay. Oh it’s okay. He’s done.
38567,Penny,Wait wait what’s 0400?
38568,Raj,Don’t worry. Everything’s fine.
38569,Leonard,I don’t eat it I just think it’s a good idea.
38570,Sheldon,If I have to I can demonstrate. Neeeeoooowwwww!
38571,Leonard,Good morning sunshine.
38572,Leonard,Geez I never realized you were so competitive.
38574,Sheldon,What does it look like? I’m playing sad harmonica in an apartment as empty as my heart.
38575,Penny,Yeah why not?
38576,Sheldon,Okay. Oh and just to be clear I’m not being intimate with you in order to keep you from going.
38577,Penny,One inappropriate yet I wish I thought of that gravy boat.
38579,Penny,Yeah okay neat but I really got to get to work so….
38580,Penny,Because it’s polite.
38581,Leonard,Mmm would you like some wine?
38582,Sheldon,Oh my your sudden appearance startles me.
38583,Sheldon,The Lord giveth and the Lord bloweth away. Well Mom according to my itinerary for our weekend together the fun begins with fried chicken.
38584,Penny,You’re right. Look from now on I will tell you the truth.
38585,Raj,Thank you. Uh would you like to uh get a cup a cup of coffee or…?
38586,Sheldon,Yes I did. And now they’re cavorting at the base of my hair follicles like dancing hippies at the Redwood National Forest.
38587,Sheldon,I didn’t. That was a lie. I opened my own toy. And it was already broken so I switched them.
38588,Penny,No no I just need to be alone.
38589,Leonard,Dammit man we’re dying here.
38590,Sheldon,But we did convince him to leave the motel. Come say hello. Leo this is Penny our friend and neighbour.
38591,Howard,Hold on a second. Kreplach?
38592,Leonard,Hey.
38593,Leonard,That’s just crazy. How would my going in there even help you?
38594,Penny,I’m sorry I buy it. All those people are on drugs.
38595,Leonard,I bet there are important discoveries being made every day because you inspired millions of kids to pursue science. In a way their discoveries are your discoveries.
38596,Raj,I’m a good listener.
38597,Penny,Well does it bother you me going out with one of your friends? ‘Cause you know you and me…
38598,Howard,No you didn’t. Okay? Look Bert when I had money I dated lots of girls who weren’t right for me. And then I gave up my money and now I’m alone and living with my friends and somebody else should probably talk now.
38599,Howard,No it’s fine. It’s not that big a deal. As long as they’re happy I’m happy. And when I get to see them for the holidays I’ll get to celebrate Diwali twice one at each house. That’s double the Diwali.
38600,Leonard,All I’m saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for Penny to see me as a member of her peer group. A potential close friend and… perhaps more. I don’t want to look like a dork.
38601,Raj,I have a card for emergencies that I pay for myself.
38602,Sheldon,Now how’s about you get us a couple of beers?
38603,Sheldon,Perhaps your talk of my sexual prowess renewed her faith in love.
38604,Raj,Okay so I’m on a Comic-Con message board and there’s a post from a guy where he says he got caught using someone else’s badge and Sheldon was right he did get charged with petty theft. Guys if I go to jail dressed as the Human Torch that might send the wrong message.
38605,Penny,What?
38606,Leonard,Oh don’t say that. You’re a very attractive woman.
38607,Raj,Ooh I I think it’s done. Oh it worked. We printed a whistle.
38608,Sheldon,I walked.
38609,Raj,Oh don’t take it so personally maybe your baby’s just a jerk.
38610,Penny,Really? All I got from Leonard was the Toblerone bar had nuts.
38611,Howard,What? I don’t need science to win her heart. I have my family’s wealth for that.
38612,Leonard,All right well off the top of my head I think the most important thing with Penny is to go really slow. I mean glacial.
38614,Howard,Good story. 
38615,Sheldon,Sheldon Cooper does not get lucky.
38616,Leonard,Somebody else do it.
38617,Raj,I appreciate it but I think staying with Leonard and Penny makes more sense for everyone.
38618,Leonard,Are you insane? Now she’s going to think I’m desperate. You’ve destroyed this relationship! And you want to know what the worst part is? You don’t even understand what you did wrong because you can’t conceive of something that you are not an expert in!
38619,Penny,So what are you saying?
38620,Sheldon,And let me tell you sleep did not come easily with Leonard in the next room singing along with Alanis Morrisette.
38621,Raj,All right but I have some conditions.
38622,Penny,Hey. Sorry this took so long. But you used to work here you know how it is.
38623,Penny,Sorry Stallion. Your weird friend Giraffe is here.
38624,Penny,I’m really happy you and Amy are back together.
38625,Sheldon,Rabeliechtli. It means turnip light and refers to a traditional lantern hand-carved from a root vegetable and used to celebrate certain Swiss festivals. Which you will not be celebrating because A these festivals occur in the fall and B you will not be going to Switzerland.
38626,Raj,Oh that sounds great a bed to yourself. Can’t even remember what that’s like.
38627,Penny,Oh no you didn’t trade the food for magic beans did you?
38628,Sheldon,I did. How was yours?
38629,Sheldon,Bye. Oh good news gentlemen. Amy’s at a conference this weekend which means I’m available to be entertained hmm. As today’s youth might put it who wants to get their Sheld-on?
38630,Sheldon,Hey how did it go?
38631,Leonard,Yeah.
38632,Sheldon,Well you’re the doctor but I am constantly hearing this annoying sound.
38633,Sheldon,No it’s not. I’ve seen things. Lady things.
38634,Howard,Maybe maybe.
38635,Sheldon,What are you proposing?
38636,Sheldon,So did you defile my mother or not?
38637,Leonard,Are you gonna introduce me to your friend?
38638,Penny,No.
38639,Leonard,Me? Well how am I supposed to fix it?
38640,Raj,And this is Leonard this is Penny.
38641,Raj,Ooh. Hot date?
38642,Sheldon,This is Indiana Jones not Star Trek. There should be no value to his pseudo-celebrity here. And even at Star Trek conventions they only let him in if he helps set up.
38643,Sheldon,In case you have forgotten Schrodinger’s cat is a thought experiment…
38644,Sheldon,Thank you. And while you’re thinking about it if you have the surgery in Nicaragua during monsoon season I can practically guarantee your death.
38645,Raj,We’re sorry Amy didn’t want to go.
38646,Penny,You gave me a bill at the end of every month.
38647,Howard,Well we were being honest. You would leave me out of the conversation with the next guy if you dumped Leonard?
38648,Sheldon,Excuse me. Is it at all possible that you’re knitting a pair of pants? Oh well no you’re understandably terrified. But you know allow me to explain. 45 days ago um I embarked on a railroad journey of healing because my university was making me do string theory and my favorite comic book store burned down and when my room mate got engaged my girlfriend wanted to move in with me which was no doubt a ploy just to see my well excuse my language but my bathing suit parts. Uh sir may I use your phone?
38649,Sheldon,Let me walk you through it our standard is the steamed dumpling appetizer General So’s chicken beef with broccoli shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable lo-main. Do you see the problem?
38650,Penny,I don’t know. I was hungry? What’s the big deal?
38651,Sheldon,Wait. I’m a little concerned. Blueberries are rich in antioxidants.
38652,Sheldon,Leonard.
38654,Sheldon,I made a boo-boo all right?
38655,Penny,Uh so Christie what are your plans?
38656,Penny,You know when they chase you out of there you only have to run faster than Sheldon.
38657,Howard,What’s going on? Oh. Wait. On. And off. What’s going on?
38658,Howard,जो भी तुम्हारे नाव मंगाई. That’s Hindi for whatever floats your boat. Uh listen I got a text from that girl Abby and she and her friend Martha want to hang out with us again. What do you say?
38659,Howard,All right. Now what?
38660,Penny,You know he never would’ve done this when we first met. He’s cockier now.
38661,Sheldon,Kripke. Come in. I’m making tea. Would you like a cup?
38662,Sheldon,Nothing. That however appears to be a football cocktail dress.
38663,Penny,Sure sure. Enjoy. I mean get it back to me when you can or you know what actually you keep it. It’s just going to be my gift to you. Bye.
38664,Penny,Uh-oh somebody’s still pouting.
38665,Leonard,Why would I have a guy? I don’t have any money.
38666,Leonard,Oh a definitely not gay musician sleeping on my girlfriend’s couch. Yippee.
38667,Leonard,Your George Lucas autograph is really a me autograph.
38668,Leonard,Oh no. When?
38669,Leonard,Forget it.
38670,Howard,Ugh I feel like I’m gonna have a heart attack.
38671,Sheldon,Okay. If you say so.
38672,Penny,Come on. She’s not that bad.
38673,Sheldon,Why else would a person try to engage their superior colliculus?
38674,Penny,Really? Interesting.
38675,Penny,Hey sorry about that.
38676,Raj,And you think that’s going to help?
38677,Penny,Uh I don’t know it’s still kind of weird. We haven’t really recovered since he proposed to me in the middle of sex.
38678,Penny,Okay I’m not moving anywhere. What the hell is this all about?
38679,Sheldon,Your parents made the right decision.
38680,Leonard,Oh you know I’m a physicist so I thought about stuff.
38681,Sheldon,Goodbye Honey Puffs hello Big Bran.
38682,Raj,Low self-esteem.
38683,Sheldon,I am. So much so that I’m gonna bring her here for dinner on our next date night.
38684,Sheldon,Oh better than good.
38685,Raj,Nothing to worry about. She’s just been crying for a little while and I was wondering if you had any tricks to get her to sleep.
38686,Howard,You told me you were going to have the talk with him.
38687,Penny,Amy remember when we went over things that would be helpful and things that wouldn’t?
38688,Leonard,Yeah I’ll call you back.
38689,Leonard,Sometimes with women you want to listen to what upsets them and then show them that you can grow and change.
38690,Leonard,Guys.
38691,Leonard,I get it.
38692,Leonard,What is? No not like that! Just Leonard went to the office.
38693,Leonard,How you guys doing?
38694,Leonard,It’s a splatter thing. There’s a little piece of tape on the floor you’re supposed to stand behind.
38695,Sheldon,I can’t tell you why I can’t tell you. So I guess there’s two things I can’t tell you.
38696,Leonard,Subtle mom real subtle.
38697,Sheldon,I’d rather have a blowfly lay eggs and hatch larvae in my auditory canal.
38698,Raj,You know who’s apparently very smart is the girl who played TV’s Blossom. She got a PhD in neuroscience or something.
38699,Howard,Exactly what I expected. Two people forcing their ideas on me and only one gentleman who could be bothered to ask me what my thoughts were. You two are out. Congratulations Leonard you’re on the team.
38700,Raj,Wow.
38701,Leonard,Actually you did do one of them together.
38702,Sheldon,Help me move my desk.
38703,Leonard,So you’re you’re saying we should stand here in my lab on a Saturday night and watch the rest of Ghostbusters on a crappy laptop?
38704,Sheldon,You’re embarrassing yourself.
38705,Leonard,It’s like looking into an obnoxious little mirror isn’t it?
38706,Leonard,I’m her husband.
38707,Raj,Now don’t blame yourself. He was a groveller from way back. But the point is the two of you got past it. And Leonard you go and propose to this poor girl in the middle of sex? That was some weak tea dude.
38708,Sheldon, Penny!
38709,Penny,Yup.  I said no put it down.
38710,Penny,Um o-okay. Sure.
38711,Sheldon,Where are you going?
38712,Sheldon,I thought you were leaving the apartment.
38713,Sheldon,Well but where does he get the helium?
38714,Raj,I don’t know she didn’t even give me a reason.
38715,Sheldon,You know I had never considered that. Wow that’s going to completely change my visits there. Well it’s late.
38716,Leonard,A hobby?
38717,Sheldon,That wasn’t a part of our original agreement and I do not agree to it now.
38718,Sheldon,I have a master’s degree and two doctorates. The things I should know I do know.
38719,Sheldon,Thought I heard you out here.
38720,Leonard,Well this sucks.
38722,Raj,Somebody got the whole thing on a cell phone and put it on youtube.
38723,Penny,Sheldon you know  that we care about you.
38724,Howard,We’ll switch. You’ll come sit with me after intermission.
38725,Howard,Yeah what if I buy my own desk?
38726,Sheldon,Simple. Earlier today he tweeted that he’s looking forward to going to his favourite sushi restaurant for dinner. I googled an interview from four years ago which was conducted in his favourite sushi restaurant. That’s where he’ll be and that’s where I’m going and…
38727,Leonard,The man restocking the cereal shelves.
38728,Sheldon,Oh yes. In fact I’ve prepared some trash talk for the occasion. You bowl like your mama. Unless of course she bowls well. In which case you bowl nothing like her.
38729,Sheldon,So a sandwich a rabbi and yo mama walk into a bar. Where are you going?
38730,Leonard,I think you’re the one who fell over.
38731,Howard,Hey you busy?
38732,Leonard,Pfff I’ve done it about two seconds 2.6 for minestrone. Anyway I was thinking more of a bio-social exploration with a neuro-chemical overlay.
38733,Leonard,Well yeah but this isn’t just about looks. I’m I’m way above average in a lot of other things.
38734,Howard,Sometimes I get so lonely I sit on my left hand until it goes numb then I put it in my right hand and pretend I’m holding hands with another person.
38735,Penny,Okay. Leonard it’s sweet you’re excited about this but it’ll be a miracle if one person asks for my autograph.
38736,Penny,And that is?
38737,Sheldon,I can’t date Amy.
38738,Howard,Doesn’t have to be Asian.
38739,Leonard,Really? Oh look at that I have a girlfriend.
38740,Raj,No wait the evening’s not over.
38741,Leonard,And I’d think you’d understand why I’m annoyed.
38742,Sheldon,No. No they loved it. They uh couldn’t say enough nice things about it.
38744,Howard,Too bad I called dibs.
38745,Sheldon,Yes.
38746,Howard,We’re glad you could make it.
38747,Sheldon,You’re here.
38748,Sheldon,You don’t get it Leonard. I’m going to miss so much the unified field theory  cold fusion the dogapus.
38749,Leonard,We haven’t been on a road trip in a while. This is fun.
38750,Raj,Lucy?
38751,Penny,I told you those Walking Dead pillowcases were a bad idea.
38752,Penny,He just doesn’t know he wants one because he’s never had one.
38753,Leonard,He wants more money.
38754,Raj,You mean Project Lenwoloppali?
38755,Penny,Are your sinuses acting up?
38756,Penny,No just try.
38757,Sheldon,And that didn’t work out did it?
38758,Sheldon,It’s called Food Friend Fight. One of us chooses three aquatic creatures and the other one must decide which he would eat befriend or battle.
38759,Howard,Boy Sophie could have used a time machine in that movie. Did you see it it’s rough.
38760,Sheldon,And I’m telling you for the last time it’s pandering it’s undignified and bite me.
38761,Penny,Okay you too.
38762,Raj,Thank you for coming with me Sheldon. You’re a good friend.
38763,Sheldon,Good Lord this is not the time for flirting keep it in your pants.
38764,Leonard,You talk to Howard lately?
38765,Penny,Oh gee Howard I really don’t want to get in the middle of this.
38766,Sheldon,An actual real scientist.  How was that?
38767,Leonard,Why a turtle?
38768,Leonard,Actually I’m hanging out with Penny.
38769,Leonard,What’s wrong?
38770,Sheldon,All right let’s start over. What did you say when Zack walked in?
38771,Leonard,Now you know how I feel when I have to put it on you.
38772,Leonard,Gee uh…
38773,Sheldon,Was she helping him with his research?
38774,Howard,Wait hang on. Did you go to a cowboy bar?
38775,Sheldon,Red Leader to Red Five come in. Red Leader to Red Five come in. Howard you promised.
38776,Leonard,Thank you.
38777,Penny,Sheldon please we already feel bad about this.
38778,Penny,Because you are giving your commencement speech.
38779,Howard,If you look carefully at Venus you should be able to see the International Space Station pass by.
38780,Raj,Oh yeah. This is one good-looking panini.
38781,Leonard,Yeah lucky for the bike it landed on my leg.
38782,Sheldon,Yeah but we don’t have to debate this. We’re scientists. We can conduct our own research. I propose that we imprison two street people and…
38783,Leonard,Yeah.
38784,Sheldon,With the friendship clause of our roommate agreement nullified you are no longer entitled to accompany me to go swimming at Bill Gates’ house should I be invited.
38785,Sheldon,Delighted? What. not if I guessed for a hundred years.
38786,Sheldon,I reject it.
38787,Leonard,Believe me Howard any girl who would be willing to play that you don’t want to see naked.
38788,Penny,We’re home.
38789,Penny,The building manager’s showing an apartment downstairs and I haven’t paid my rent.
38790,Raj,Just be honest. You don’t like it.
38791,Raj,Yeah well all the other comments said really nice things. Focus on those.
38792,Sheldon,How will Raj ever reach true greatness if his friends lower the bar for him? When I was eleven my sister bought our father a “world’s greatest dad” coffee mug and frankly the man coasted until the day he died.
38793,Leonard,Hey.
38794,Penny,What about you what?
38795,Sheldon,Fascinating. The only logical explanation is that this is a dream.
38796,Raj,If she gave you any look at l. It was a you suck look.
38797,Penny,Sheldon are you okay?
38798,Sheldon,Oh everything is just sex with you isn’t it?
38799,Penny,Happy Valentine’s Day.
38800,Raj,Knight to queen’s bishop-five.
38801,Leonard,No. No I’m not.
38802,Penny,Are you serious? For what?
38803,Leonard,It’s the only way we can play teams.
38804,Leonard,Am I still a good friend if I wait and hope that Howard offers him a place to live first?
38805,Howard,No it’s not. Howard tell them.
38806,Penny,You told Emily we hooked up?
38808,Leonard,I’m putting the city names in the grid now. I’m sure that’ll give us the code to the safe.
38809,Raj,Look we admit it. The idea that you guys came up with was really good and I’d love your help.
38810,Raj,Hey Stuart you got anything going on for Valentine’s Day?
38811,Sheldon,I did this. Monte was killed by my hubris and my pride. No matter what anybody says this is my fault.
38812,Raj,Really! Did you miss all the subtle indicators like me saying Howard I am upset.
38813,Sheldon,May I buy you a beverage?
38814,Sheldon,Of course there’s the other possibility that this date kicks off a rather unpleasant six months of the two of you passing awkwardly in the hall until one of you breaks down and moves to another zip code.
38815,Penny,Well I’m having an impossible time getting my career off the ground and I got offered a role in this crappy horror movie and I just don’t know if I should take it.
38816,Penny,Are you sure because it doesn’t seem fine?
38817,Sheldon,And turned their phones off.
38818,Howard,I guess uh I’d like her to sit me down look me in the eye and say I was wrong. I love you. And then maybe she could touch me in a special way.
38819,Sheldon,Then you can drive. Let’s go.
38820,Sheldon,Meemaw look I’m sorry but I have to defend my girlfriend to you.
38821,Penny,So tell me how did Sheldon look with an earring?
38822,Sheldon,Oh! I don’t usually pick up on those things. Good for me.
38823,Sheldon,The plural of coccyx is coccyges.
38824,Penny,Go ahead.
38825,Penny,Oh Leonard what time is it?
38826,Leonard,Absolutely not.
38827,Leonard,I promise.
38828,Howard,Hey we’ve always talked about playing together.
38829,Raj,I have to return the helicopter. My father… What did you do?
38830,Penny,I don’t know what Emily’s so upset about anyway. Even if I had slept with him so what? Everyone has a past.
38831,Penny,Aw it’s so nice. She’s gonna love it.
38832,Leonard,Okay yeah it’s true but I can live with that stuff. What I can’t live with is you casually informing me that some guy’s going to be staying in your apartment without even asking me first!
38833,Sheldon,But I designed it.
38835,Sheldon,Here’s a fun Postal fact. The inner side of our mailbox is under federal jurisdiction. So if you broke my right thumb that’s Pasadena city police. But if you broke my left thumb that’s the FBI.
38836,Penny,Thanks.
38838,Leonard,Hey I got an email from Professor Proton.
38839,Sheldon,He said start with it not end with it.
38840,Sheldon,You know the more I think about it the more intrigued I am about having our own store.
38841,Leonard,Meet back here in an hour?
38842,Leonard,Or nobody calls anyone.
38843,Howard,Yeah it’s the highest rated one on the market. I wouldn’t even call it a crib I’d call it a Fortress of Solitude for babies.
38844,Leonard,Well…
38845,Penny,Right.
38846,Leonard,You’re not going to Switzerland!
38847,Raj,Whatever. I can see my little princess while I’m at work right?
38848,Sheldon,What is that?
38849,Sheldon,Who wrote that?
38850,Penny,Again I’ve never given it much thought.
38851,Penny,You should just talk to him I’m sure you guys can work this out.
38852,Sheldon,It’s Sheldon.
38853,Leonard,What’s the last thing you were ever happy about?
38854,Raj,Bye buddy!
38855,Sheldon,Uh excuse me but every year you prepare a terrible meal and every year I criticize it. Do our traditions mean nothing to you?
38856,Raj,I know. What started as a pap smear turned into a date. Which turned into her working there which turned into marriage which then turned into hatred which continues to this day. Two-Eyed Cyclops.
38857,Sheldon,Yeah but it’s still so aggravating.
38859,Penny,Oh she doesn’t have a boyfriend she has a Sheldon. So do you like Stuart?
38860,Sheldon,Well said old chap. I thought eloquence had died here it stands before us. Starting today it’ll go Gettysburg Address I have a dream and what he just said.
38861,Sheldon,The spiny anteater never went behind my back and worked with Barry Kripke. That didn’t help at all.
38862,Sheldon,And just like that you’re a Klingon-Sanskrit junkie.
38863,Leonard,I was hoping we could talk about the money again.
38864,Penny,Sit on the damn couch.
38865,Howard,I have to talk to her about this.
38866,Penny,Probably not.
38867,Howard,Yeah?
38869,Sheldon,Yeah one would assume on getting out of the pit.
38870,Sheldon,And you said the party starts at seven.
38871,Sheldon,Oh yes it’s time for me to make love to your daughter’s vagina.
38872,Raj,Okay. How ’bout a little Miley Cyrus next?
38873,Penny,Everyone.
38874,Raj,Yeah. Start Saturday morning go 48 hours sleeping bags junk food.
38875,Leonard,You have a girlfriend? How could you have a girlfriend? You can’t even speak to women.
38876,Sheldon,Yes Penny has a lot of her money tied up in promiscuity futures.
38877,Sheldon,Fine. We’re travelling forward at good Lord 51 miles an hour. Now let’s assume that your brakes are new and the callipers are aligned still by the time we come to a stop we’ll be occupying the same space as that Buick in front of us an impossibility that nature will quickly resolve into death mutilation and… oh look they built a new put-put course.
38878,Penny,Well go ask Leonard.
38879,Leonard,As a matter of fact I.. I… I can’t… I can’t… I can’t do it.
38880,Sheldon,I know I know good grief was originally said by Charlie Brown geez.
38881,Leonard,Are you kidding? No no.
38882,Leonard,Whatever. You can’t even go on a date without checking your relationship agreement.
38884,Raj,We have 128 assorted Penny Blossoms ready to ship.
38885,Leonard,Okay. Now we all run out. Sheldon and I will cut to the left behind these trees. Raj Howard and Leslie flank to the right behind the rocks. Then we’ll all have a great view as Penny runs out and kills everyone else in sight.
38886,Sheldon,Get rid of the trade route part? Then how would Palpatine get Chancellor Valorum kicked out of office? How would he get himself elected? How? Can we get through one holiday without you saying something ridiculous?
38888,Sheldon,Biologists are mean.
38889,Penny,She did soften your life didn’t she?
38890,Penny,Um I don’t know a psychiatrist? So hey how are things with you and Lesley?
38891,Leonard,No.
38892,Leonard,What are you doing?
38893,Leonard,Okay let’s try it this way what if the People magazine thing is the best Raj is ever going to achieve?
38894,Penny,Do or do not. There is no try.
38895,Penny,Well congratulations.
38896,Raj,Hey.
38897,Penny,Well they’re all still up there.
38898,Howard,Yeah no but it is basic human nature. If we present him as a prize maybe they would.
38899,Sheldon,No. It’s just a suspicion I have. Mmm mmm mmm.
38901,Howard,Enough chitchat. How do we know you are who you say you are?
38902,Penny,So I know this goes without saying but if either of you tell Leonard you helped me rewrite this paper I will beat you both with a bag of oranges.
38903,Sheldon,Alright now the purpose of this drill is to acclimate us to the use of tools in extreme temperatures such as we will face in the Arctic Circle.
38904,Penny,Really never?
38905,Raj,Yeah me too.
38906,Penny,What if they call our names?
38907,Leonard,Uh yeah no uh bye Penny.
38908,Sheldon,Yes but you didn’t portray her as completely irrational.
38909,Sheldon,All right fine she doesn’t need her own point of view. Now chop-chop.
38910,Penny,Yeah. It was fine. We went to a Melissa Etheridge concert I got an A it all worked out.
38911,Penny,There you go.
38913,Raj,You’re impossible.
38914,Sheldon,I don’t care if anybody gets it I’m going as the Doppler Effect.
38916,Sheldon,It’s been in every wallet I’ve owned since I was five.
38917,Sheldon,Killed by badger.
